# Mór-Ga-Nok

Mór-Ga-Nok is the final boss of [The%20Wild%20Moon](The Wild Moon) in [Legends%20of%20Kingdom%20Rush](Legends of Kingdom Rush). Mór-Ga-Nok is a three-faced spirit of the wild; Mór, the Soil, Ga, the Omen, and Nok, the Havoc. They are evoked by the Ashervan Treefolk to aid them in ridding Silveroak Forest of outsiders. Once summoned, Mór-Ga-Nok possesses the Argentree, the source of life for the forest and starts to spread it's evil curse throughout the once peaceful forest, corrupting and decaying as it spreads further.
