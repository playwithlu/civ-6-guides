# Crystal Demolisher

Crystal Demolishers are crystalline enemies. They are encountered in the Anurian Wetlands, the fourth [environment](environment) of , introduced in the Subaquatic Menace [Campaign](Mini-Campaign). They are one of the hardest-hitting enemies in the series.
## Overview

"A golem constructed with magical crystals all over its body. If they collect enough magic they become unstoppable creatures of mass destruction".
Crystal Demolishers are huge golems infused with pink magical crystals. They move slowly but hit extremely hard, even more than other giant enemies in the series and more than some minibosses. While they initially lack any armor, they will gain a stacking armor buff per nearby [Anurian%20Channeler](Anurian Channeler), making melee towers and barracks less useful against them. Upon defeat, they will crumble and damage any troops or heroes for 300 physical damage, finishing off most troops they didn't kill.
The biggest danger is their tendency to appear in large numbers. This can quickly and easily overwhelm barracks troops due to their numbers and damage.
