## Overview

"One of the legendary spider queens, Sarelgaz rules the Northern lands."
Sarelgaz is the classic damage-sponge boss. While she has an astronomically huge HP pool (the highest in the series for a non-endless mode boss) and a huge horde of minions, she has no special tricks at all, not even an area attack - the only thing she can do is make slow progress towards the exit, although she'll anything that she attacks.
