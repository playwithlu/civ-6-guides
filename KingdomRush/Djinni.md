## Overview

"Bound by ancient magic pacts centuries ago, these old mystical creatures must protect the desert without harming people. Yet, they don't need to be deadly to be terrific protectors."
Strategy.
Taking after the [Mercenary%20Camp](Genies) from Frontiers, these units are a massive threat to any defense. Instead of attacking your troops, they polymorph your troops temporarily, which they will do every 1.3s. Your troops will transform back after 13s. They also have a second ability, which turns your towers into sand castles for 10s. This ability has a cooldown of 40s, and starts fully charged when they spawn.
They also sport high health and very high magic resistance, so it will take heavy physical damage, often from long range to take them out.
