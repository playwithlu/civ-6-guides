# Iron Challenge

The Iron Challenge is the third type of challenge mode in the Kingdom Rush Series. It is a difficult challenge for skilled players.
Description.
In order to unlock the Iron Challenge on a level, the player must have got all three [Upgrades](Stars)/points for the [Campaign](Campaign) mode of that level. The player only has one [lives](life) and has to withstand a long, grueling wave of enemies. Certain towers are locked in this challenge, most often it is two towers, but some stages are limited to only one. Like the [Heroic%20Challenge](Heroic Challenge), upgrade paths are limited to a certain level. Completion of the challenge is rewarded with a Star. When completed, the flag of the respective area on the campaign mode map will gain a silver tint.
Unlike other modes, the Iron Challenge does not indicate the number of enemies which will attack in the wave from each path - the enemy number is replaced with two question marks. It could be because they don't really want the player to know how much enemies there are so that they won't let them know how long it takes the Iron Challenge to finish.
In , there is no limit to available upgrades or the availability of a Hero. No points are awarded upon its completion, however, like all levels completed in the game, gems are awarded at the end. Having 3 stars on a level is also not necessary in order to unlock the Iron Challenge.
