# Moloch

Moloch is the boss of the Burning Torment mini-[campaign](campaign) in [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush). He is the leader of the demons in Pandaemonium and has managed to gain Vez'Nan's soul and keeps it in a cage next to his throne.
## Overview

"A feared and overconfident demon overlord, he eats hot coals for breakfast!"
Moloch's modest health is balanced out by his dangerously fast movement speed. Unlike [Vez%27nan](Vez'nan)'s soul drain attack which cannot kill [Sorcerer%20Mage](Earth Elementals), Moloch's group has no restrictions. His path is very short, and combined with his above average speed and ability to quickly clear units designed to stall him, he can easily overtake an unprepared player.
