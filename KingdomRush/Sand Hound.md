# Sand Hound

Sand Hounds are the version of [Wulf](Wulves). Like Wulves, they are one of the fastest enemies in the games. Though they have a 25% chance to dodge melee attacks, they are still very weak, and even a basic [Militia%20Barracks](Militia Barracks) soldier can stop them in their tracks.
## Overview

"Very fast and vicious creatures that can dodge melee attacks."
Sand Hounds usually come in numbers and, combined with their fast speed, can quickly slip through towers. However, later on, they have far too little health to be effective.
