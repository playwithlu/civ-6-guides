# Necromancer

"This article is about the enemy in [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush). For the tower in , see [Necromancer%20Tower](Necromancer Tower). "
Necromancers are dark mages that can summon [Skeleton](Skeleton)s and [Skeleton%20Knight](Skeleton Knight)s. They can also attack soldiers from a distance.
## Overview

"Master of the dark arts, the Necromancer summons undead minions to do their bidding."
Necromancers are relatively rare but very difficult to destroy: not only do they have a solid amount of hit points and a ranged attack (ranged attack deals [True%20Damage](True Damage) on flash) but also the ability to spawn a never-ending swarm of meat shields made of skeletons. The Necromancer raises four to six skeletons at a time, along with an occasional Skeleton Knight. The skeletons spawned do not provide any [gold](gold), making them even more obnoxious.
They have a 5% chance to raise a Skeleton Knight instead of a Skeleton.
