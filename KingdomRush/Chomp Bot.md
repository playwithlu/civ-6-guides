## Overview

"Little machines created to help dwarves in their daily tasks and fend off enemies with their hydraulic jaws."
Chomp Bots are moderately durable enemies (for their numbers) and, being made of metal, are mildly resistant to physical attacks. Their listed damage is deceptively low as they actually attack three times in quick succession.
Being mechanical enemies, when reduced to 0 HP by methods other than Artillery damage or , a Chomp Bot leaves behind a wreckage that stays where it is for a few moments and can be repaired to full health by [Smokebeard%20Engineer](Smokebeard Engineer)s; their bounty is only awarded once they are destroyed for good, either by waiting enough time for their wreckage to crumble, or interrupting the repairing engineer.
