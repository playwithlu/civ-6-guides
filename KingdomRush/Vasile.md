# Vasile

Vasile is a vampire who resides in the [Dusk%20Chateau](Dusk Chateau) - a castle built on the mountains near the Rift of Cinders and the boss of the Shadowmoon mini-campaign in .
## Overview

"The Everlasting Prince has been a dark and vicious menace over the kingdom since its foundation."
During the stage, Vasile mostly stays in the castle. At the start of every wave or every time the [Moon](Moon) is full, he walks to the balconies to taunt the player, where he can neither be selected nor targeted.
After wave 15, Vasile will send out a large wave of [Vampiresa](Vampiresa) before he joins the fray, heading towards the western exit. He has the ability to bite into a victim's neck healing himself by 450 HP. It kills soldiers unless they are lucky with dodge or Holy Grail, but deals just 150 True Damage to heroes.
When he is defeated for the first time, Vasile will transform into a bat, fall back to the castle before emerging to attack for a second time, alongside a new wave of Vampiresa. This time, he chooses the eastern path and moves faster than before, possessing a much deadlier version of the [Phantom%20Warrior](Phantom Warrior's) death aura, killing any troops or heroes in vicinity within mere seconds. It affects both living and [Necromancer%20Tower](undead) units. Neither [Tribal%20Axethrowers](Tribal Axethrowers)' Totem of Spirit nor [Dante](Dante's) can disable the aura.
When Vasile dies, nearly all of the enemies will die along with him, except for a few Vampiresa that have not landed yet, who must be killed for the stage to end.
