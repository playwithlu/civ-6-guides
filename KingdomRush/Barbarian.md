# Barbarian

Description.
The hulking barbarians rush into battle with little to no armor, preferring mobility over protection and attack over defense.
Recruiting.
We came across a camper during our travels.
We found out the camper was a hulking barbarian sharpening his axes.
"I'm bored waiting. I come with you and put axe in enemies, good?"
The barbarian grinned wickedly and crossed his axes behind his back as he joined us.
"You have my axes!"
Traits.
 Berserk : When damaged, the hero has a 40% chance of going Berserk, gaining Bonus Damage and Regeneration, as long as they hit an enemy every turn. When Berserk ends, the Hero becomes Stunned. 
 "The Barbarian is on a frenzy that grants him +2 Damage and +2 Regeneration. If the Barbarian doesn't attack while berserk, he will become stunned for 1 turn."
 Fortify : Gains extra armor until the next turn if the character ends their turn without using any skills
 "This unit has +2 for this turn."
