Strategy.
Unique among ranged towers, the Shaolin Temple sends Shaolin Monks to attack and briefly stun enemies within range, return to the temple after each attack and stay locked on them until the enemies either die or leave the temple's range. It is most effective against large numbers of weak enemies with little to no physical armor. The monks can also attack and stun flying enemies. The stuns make it very hard for certain enemies like Smokebeard Engineers, Ice Witches, Svell Druids and Leaping Dragons to use their abilities. Overall, the temple is a very distinctive source of ranged damage and crowd control.
Shaolin Monks' stun combined with decent attack speed makes it excellent at slowing down larger targets or small groups as 2 or 3 temples can prove excellent at almost stun-locking a single enemy with a small inch. This however does not mean the dps is great for Shaolin as the enemy will take longer to kill (especially the giants with armor) so using towers with high dps can prove a pretty good combo as the temple can slow down enemies while a tower like the Blazing Gem can chip down its health making it easier to kill.
The temple locks on up to three enemies at a time and each Shaolin Monk upgrade adds another monk to lock onto another target, but this should be the last investment due to being extremely expensive at nearly 300 or more gold apiece. It may not even be worth it anyway since the additional monks do not stack on targets locked onto by other monks; the upgrade only raises the number of affected targets.
With the Hammerhold DLC release, the cost for extra monks was cut in half to 175/148, so it is much easier to make use of.
The very first upgrade should "always" be the Lion of Abundance since it costs 100 gold or less to buy and increases the bounty of every enemy in range of the temple, even if the monks don't deal the official killing blows. This stacks with other gold-generating abilities like those from Beresad and Dianyun.
The Dragon Warrior upgrade is also a very worthwhile investment since the warrior has tremendous health and deals great physical damage to enemies he fights.
