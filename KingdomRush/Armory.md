# Armory

The Armory appears in [Lightseeker%20Camp](Lightseeker Camp). 
Description.
On the bottom of the map, near the bottom right exit, the Armory sits just off the path. [Footman](Footmen) can walk into the Armory instead of following the path. Those that do so disappear inside the building, emerging seconds later having gained new armor and weapons and turned into [Paladin](Paladin)s. They rejoin the central path instead of the bottom one they joined from.
