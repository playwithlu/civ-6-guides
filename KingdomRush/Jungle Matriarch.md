# Jungle Matriarch

Jungle Matriarchs (Matriarch on the mobile version) are jungle-dwelling cousins of the [Spider%20Matriarch](Spider Matriarch) from the original [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush). They lay eggs on the path, from which hatch [Spiderling](Spiderling)s.
## Overview

"This aggressive predator hunts using its offspring to overwhelm its victims."
Jungle Matriarchs are much more powerful but slower versions of the [Spider%20Matriarch](Spider Matriarch)s. Much like their forest cousins, Jungle Matriarchs can lay eggs that spawn three Spiderlings. Spiderlings are extremely weak, but are lightning fast and very numerous, making low level and impractical as they lack the speed to efficiently fend off lots of enemies.
Jungle Matriarchs have high Magic Resistance, making mages relatively useless against them. However, they can be more easily dealt with by a strong archer, and the DWAARP negates their spawn.
