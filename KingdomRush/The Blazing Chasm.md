# The Blazing Chasm

"The Chasm interrupts our path, its bottom filled with flowing lava."
"Luckily for us, there's a big and heavy tree trunk nearby"
The Blazing Chasm is a dice challange in the Legends of Kingdom Rush Extradimensional Menace campaign. It interrupts the path between two nods, and can be forseen with a sign with a lava river. The Chasm has three choices, two of them are dice challanges and the third one is non risk choice.
Option.
Jump across the chasm..
Agility focused dice challange (Ranger, Sylvan Elf). If succesful a text will show up and the player gains up 450 XP.
"or"
We miscalculated our jump and barely made it to the edge on the other side, losing some of our valuables trying to climb up.
Use the tree trunk..
Dice challange for strong focused characters (Gerald, Sasquatch). On success, gain 450 XP.
Take a Detour..
A non risk choice, but you will probably get exhausted on a few characters.
