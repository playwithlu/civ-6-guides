= Night Warriors =
We spot the ruins of a decrepit building and get closer to inspect it further.
Inside, we find a large hall filled with statues of monsters, with a big chest on the opposite side of the room.
Options.
Analyse the statues.
Requires one of: [Orc%20Cleaver](Orc Cleaver)
We analysed the statues with extreme caution and found out that they were, in fact, gargoyles in their rock form!
We weren't sure what to do next, but night would soon fall...
Destroy them!
Requires Mighty unit (auto-success)
We decided to destroy them for good, since sooner or later they would surely wreak havoc somewhere.
With the menace eliminated, we proceeded to loot the chest before continuing our journey.
Seal them!
Requires Magical unit (auto-success)
We decided to conjure a barrier magic spell on them to prevent their transformation.
With the menace under control, we proceeded to loot the chest before continuing our journey.
Forget it.
"or, on loss:"
Everything seemed safe enough, so we decided to open the chest.
Once we touched it, we heard sounds of cracking stone all around us. In an instant, a swarm of fierce gargoyles lunged over us!
Completely outnumbered, we escaped as fast as we could, but not without suffering some scratches and bites first.
