# As Darkness Falls

As Darkness Falls is a random event in the game [Legends%20of%20Kingdom%20Rush](Legends of Kingdom Rush) in the map [The%20Wild%20Moon](The Wild Moon).
As we pass through a clearing, the light of the moon recedes and the world goes dark due to a strange eclipse.
Torches prove mysteriously ineffective, and we can barely see beyond our own noses.

"It glows...".
Requires: Ashervan amulet from [A%20Dialogue%20with%20the%20Stars](A Dialogue with the Stars)
The Ashervan amulet started to hum and glow dimly.
It was not a great source of light, but it reminded us of the witch's last words, so we looked towards the sky.
The constellations that resembled beasts shone bright.
Maybe we could follow them like the Ashervan did and find a way out.
Which one should be our starting point?
We walked with confidence. The amulet still hummed.
We had to follow another constellation of stars. But which one?
We walked with confidence. The amulet's hum got stronger.
We had to follow another constellation of stars. But which one?
There was light coming from behind a group of trees in the distance, yet the world was still in darkness.
We pressed on and through the thicket until the light blinded us and the amulet burned in our hands.
We found ourselves standing at the very edge of an Ashervan enclave.
The sight filled us with fear, as treefolk emerged from sack-like fruits, while the Ashervan chanted and danced in dissonance.
They stopped for a brief moment when they saw us and then lunge forward with a ferocious battle cry.
