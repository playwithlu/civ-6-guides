Description.
"Wizards specialized in warfare that can charge homing magical bolts of deadly magic."
The Archmage Tower is the quintessential source of magical damage, possessing high DPS, able to make short work of enemies with high HP or physical armor - in many ways, their role is similar to the [Arcane%20Wizard](Arcane Wizard) from the original [Kingdom%20Rush](game). Unlike the Arcane Wizard, the Archmage also possesses decent crowd control power with Twister and Critical Mass. The Archmage has a faster rate of fire and, with max [Upgrades](Upgrades), has a higher base damage than the Arcane Wizard.
Compared to the other level 4 Magic Tower, the [Necromancer%20Tower](Necromancer Tower), the Archmage has vastly superior damage output from both its regular attacks and special abilities but does not possess as much utility as the Necromancer with its skeletal minions.
