## Overview

"Favoring the ways of the Old God's magic, Sand Mystics can heal their allies and bring harm to their enemies with equal finesse."
Strategy.
Although it is stated that Sand Mystics can heal allies and harm enemies in equal measure, this is not necessarily true in practice. They are fully capable of performing a healing role, but they also deal an "absolutely colossal" amount of explosive area damage at 220-260. A single strike can bring an entire group of Orc Warriors or Demon Guards to near-death, if not outright killing them.
The Sand Mystics possess damage that matches, and at times even surpasses, that of Linirea's finest, such as Gerald or Alric. Though their role as healers should not be ignored, consider treating these enemies more as one-woman heavy artillery platforms first, then healers second. Use Archer Towers to quickly dispose of them, trap them in melee to nullify both their healing and their ranged attacks, and for the love of all that is cruel and unholy, do not let them shoot at your troops.
