Tips and Tricks.
Rurin Longbeard is a hero specialized in Tanking. He has a rather modest damage output, but a lot of armor and a good amount of health, able to take on most enemies that come in his way, save for [Saurian%20Brute](Saurian Brute)s and [Saurian%20Blazefang](Saurian Blazefang)s. While he can survive well on his own, it is wise to back him up with some high-damage towers and Barracks, since Rurin's low base damage won't allow him to kill anything quickly. He should be ordered to retreat if a [Saurian%20Brute](Saurian Brute), or a group of [Saurian%20Blazefang](Saurian Blazefang)s are coming at him, since he will most likely die against these enemies and pose a problem with his 35 seconds of respawn time, the longest of all heroes in the whole frachise. Other than those, he can tank fairly well, even versus the powerful [Saurian%20Savant](Saurian Savant)s, and weaken multiple enemies with Hammer Smash. Tactical use of him can ease down the pressure on a choke point.
He moves at the same speed of [Sha%27tra](Sha'tra), slightly faster than [Alric](Alric). So, it is advised not to move him around much (especially not between the two lanes in the Dark Descent) unless his health is extremely low.
Rurin reaches his full potential when paired with heroes like Dante and Sha'tra. He can tank tough enemies while Silver Bullet and Abduction recharge, and he can weaken hordes with his area damage for Akimbo Style and all of Sha'tra's horde-killing abilities to finish them off.
