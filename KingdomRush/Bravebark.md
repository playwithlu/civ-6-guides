Tips and Tricks.
Bravebark is a melee physical hero that excels at supporting &amp; healing chokepoints, and eliminating troublesome foes before they pose a threat. Bravebark has a hybrid playstyle of supporting units with his supportive crowd control abilities, with a potent assassination tool in the form of Branchball. Bravebark is able to traverse the map via his sprouting, which is akin to a teleport except slower than most other heroes that are able to teleport. Overall, Bravebark serves as a great defender of chokepoints when micromanaged well to his full potential. 
While Bravebark is a tank with a good HP pool of up to 600 with 40% armor, and could be used for blocking enemies for as long as he can, his natural heal rate is slow ahis attack rate is one of the slowest of all heroes with an attack rate of 2 seconds. As such, it is ill-advised to maintain Bravebark constantly in melee combat, especially if Springsap is not ready yet. However, Bravebark can afford to fight the toughest of enemies in preparation of a well timed and proper utilization of Springsap in lieu to his supportive nature.
The mobility from sprouting allows Bravebark to switch to a new area for blocking enemies, tactical use, and/or retreating. Bravebark is still susceptible to damage whilst performing the sprout animation, therefore players are recommended to plan somewhat ahead, as the teleport animation takes about 3 seconds to execute, with Bravebark still being able to take damage for 1 second before turning invulnerable.
Description.
Having saved his heart tree from destruction, Bravebark roams the lands looking for new soils, until a new threat calls him back to his duties as the last forest warden.
