# Reaper Lord

Reaper Lords are bigger, more powerful specimens of the [Reaper](Reaper) aliens. They serve as minibosses in the [Temple%20of%20Evil](Temple of Evil) endless stage. They have no encyclopedia entry.
## Overview

At least one Reaper Lord is spawned every tenth wave of the level. As a mini-boss, they are functionally identical to giant enemies and have an area attack, swiping at soldiers twice consecutively, but possess the stats on par with true bosses, are immune to [Instant%20kill](Instant kill)s and most [afflictions](afflictions), and take away 20 lives if leaked.
One thing to note is that Reaper Lords are not affected by the [Reaper%20Queen](Reaper Queen's) war cry, unlike the [Parasyte](Parasyte)s and [Reaper](Reaper)s that get a massive boost in attack and speed.
By wave 40 in normal mode, the Reaper Lord's HP will have reached an equal amount to [Umbra](Umbra). By wave 60, his HP will be almost twice that of [Sarelgaz](Sarelgaz), the highest-HP boss in the entire series.
