= Like a Shadow in the Night =
We set up camp in the middle of the night and hear rustling footsteps beyond the trees. Something is out there.
Options.
Shoot in the dark.
Requires a Ranged unit
Trusting our ears, we aimed between the trees until we heard a screech.
Upon further inspection, we discovered foot tracks leading away from the camp.
Whatever had been prowling around did not return to bother us again.
"or"
We trusted our senses, but we aimed poorly and ended up upsetting a couple of bears, which trashed our camp in a roaring fury.
Craft a trap.
Requires a Crafter unit (auto-success)
The trap sprung a couple of hours later, and we leapt into action only to find that it had caught an enormous yet harmless rabbit.
We set it free and went to sleep again. Nothing bothered us for the rest of the night.
