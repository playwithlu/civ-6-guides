# Redcap

Redcaps are tiny, evil gnomes that live in the Faery Forest in .
## Overview

"Small, evil gnomes with huge scythes, they live for the thrill of bloody combat."
Similar to [Bandit](Bandit)s from the original [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush), Redcaps are weak and unarmored, but are fast and numerous enough to overwhelm a player's defense. Redcaps have a 10% chance to instantly kill any single soldier, or deal 100 physical damage to [heroes](heroes) with Death Strike, regenerating 25 HP per 0.1 second for 2 seconds, healing them back to full HP even on Veteran/Impossible Difficulty.
Strategy.
Due to their low HP pool, it is recommended to counter them with area attacks, such as the [Arch-Druid%20Henge](Arch-Druid Henge), [Weirdwood](Weirdwood), or the [Arcane%20Archers](Arcane Archers)' Burst Arrow and the [Wild%20Magus](Wild Magus)' Eldritch Doom skills. The [Forest%20Keepers](Forest Keepers) are also good against them, thanks to their slowing capability with Eerie Gardener, and the ability to kill Redcaps in one shot with Ancient Oak Spears II or III.
Blocking them is possible, though risky, since it is impossible to know for sure when a soldier will die, giving Redcaps an advantage. [Vez%27nan](Vez'nan's) Dark Pact seems to not be affected by the instant kill though.
