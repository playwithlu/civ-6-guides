# Rain of Fire

Rain of Fire is the second of the two major spells in [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush) and . When used, a red targeting icon will appear on the map, and once selected it rains down several meteors on the ground, causing area-of-effect [True%20Damage](True Damage) to both ground and flying enemies. It is useful for eliminating small hordes of enemies, and acts well as a last-minute lifesaver. However, its long cooldown time (80 seconds) somewhat reduces its effectiveness.
Initially, it starts with three meteors, but additional upgrades will increase its damage, explosion radius and meteor count, and leave behind burning ground that deals physical damage to survivors of the initial attack. The cooldown is also reduced.
In , Rain of Fire is replaced by [Thunderbolt](Thunderbolt), which serves the same function as a spell that deals area-of-effect True Damage on a long cooldown.
In , Rain of Fire is replaced by [Soul%20Impact](Soul Impact), which serves the same function.
