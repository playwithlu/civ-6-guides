# Rocket Riders

The Rocket Riders are the first to be introduced in .
Description.
"Soar high and explode big is these rocket-riding goblins' motto. They keep this in mind as they crash against the ground, damaging all enemies caught in the explosion."
Tier 4: "Goblins that fly ride large rockets into the sky. Note: They don't know how to land."
"Ready for the big boom-boom?" the twitchy goblin lighting the fuse asked the one riding the rocket.
"To infinity and beyooooond!!!!" replied the rider as the rocket blasted off soaring higher and higher.
When the first rocket prototypes were introduced they were a big hit amongst the Dark Army, but they would always miss their mark, someone would have to control them, but who would be crazy enough to do so? There was only one answer, the reckless explosion loving Goblins!
"Soar high and explode big!" is their motto and the only thing they love more than a bunch of gunpowder is getting to light it up.
