# Clockwork Spider

Clockwork Spiders are fast-moving mechanical spiders built by the dwarves.
## Overview

"Little clockwork spiders used by dwarves for exploring and patrolling the empire."
Clockwork Spiders are the rough equivalent of [Wulf](Wulves) and [Sand%20Hound](Sand Hound)s in previous games: weak, basic fast-moving enemies that come in great numbers. Compared to the aforementioned enemies, Clockwork Spiders have slightly more HP and give less [gold](gold) but lack the ability to dodge melee attacks.
