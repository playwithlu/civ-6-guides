## Overview

"Vikings mounted on dragons that can fly over enemies for a short time. (Cooldown: 5 seconds, duration: 2 seconds, speed factor: 1.8)"
Fat blue dragons with small wings mounted by minute Northerners, these are capable of "leaping" for short periods of time to avoid troops and artillery. Their health is average but they do sport medium armor, which makes magic towers more useful at dealing with them. Treat Leap Dragons as upgraded, armored [Quarry%20Worker](Quarry Worker)s - except for the fact that archers and mages can still target them while flying. Oftentimes, they will appear in pairs, which makes them slightly less easy to block compared to Quarry Workers. When they change stances between flying and walking, incoming shots tend to be nullified and not connect with their targets.
