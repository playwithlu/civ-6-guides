# Snow Golem

Snow Golems are enemies encountered in the Frozen North, in . They were introduced in the Frozen Nightmare [Campaign](Mini-Campaign).
## Overview

 "Send a goblin plane to drop a bomb on the Snow Golem. Otherwise, this tough creature will wake up."
They double as scenery and start in scattered location across every Frozen Nightmare level. As waves progress, they will wake up one by one and inch very slowly towards designated exits.
When the Snow Golem is dormant, they can be bombed to instantly kill them. It costs 200 gold per golem in the main levels and 100 in the [Heroic%20Challenge](Heroic Challenge), which gives the player a painful choice: Spend a good amount of gold, or be forced to face a high-HP, high-damage enemy that drops chump [Gold](change). Fortunately, they do not appear in [Iron%20Challenge](Iron Challenge)s at all.
