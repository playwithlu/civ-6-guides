# Drider

Driders are twisted fusions of Twilight elves and spiders that appear in the first Elven City.
## Overview

"Half spider, half elf abominations that charge into battle without fear or mercy."
Driders can be treated as more powerful spiders: fast but not as weak individually nor as numerous as [Sword%20Spider](Sword Spider)s or [Son%C2%A0of%20Mactans](SonÂ of Mactans). In addition to that, they can poison and also can breed from soldiers: when a Drider kills one of their enemies (whether soldiers, reinforcements, Greenlings, etc.), they'll encase them in a cocoon from which hatches another Drider, making low-level Defender Barracks essentially food to spawn more Driders. This spawned Drider does give gold when killed on Android, Steam, and Switch, but not on iOS. The cooldown of poison attack increases with each generation of Drider.
Their poison deals 84 damage over 10 seconds.
