# Gnoll Reaver

Gnoll Reavers are the first and weakest enemy encountered in .
## Overview

"Lowly creatures that serve as forward troops of every gnoll assault."
Gnoll Reavers are the weakest enemies in the game and by far the easiest to defeat, comparable to [Goblin](Goblin)s and [Desert%20Thug](Desert Thug)s of the previous games. Though stronger than Goblins and Desert Thugs, they are so weak that even in large numbers, they pose virtually no threat, except as fodder to be transformed into [Blood%20Gnoll](Blood Gnoll)s by [Bloodsydian](Bloodsydian) or [Blood%20Ogre](Blood Ogre)s.
In Impossible difficulty, Gnoll Reavers gain a larger HP buff than between the other difficulties, as well as a damage buff. While this hardly makes them more threatening in practice (except perhaps in some of the early Heroic/Iron challenges, where upgrades are restricted), it does set the standard for the new difficulty rating, showing that later levels will be quite hard.
