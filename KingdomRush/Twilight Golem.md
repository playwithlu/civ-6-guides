# Twilight Golem

Twilight Golems (Golems on mobile version) are hulking masses of rock created by the Twilight elves that appear in .
## Overview

"Rocks animated by powerful sorcery, compelled to fight with daunting strength."
Twilight Golems are made up of large, grey stones held together by purple twilight magic. They appear somewhat humanoid, possessing glowing purple eyes. Although they levitate slightly above the ground, they function as ground enemies, and thus are fully susceptible to being targeted by artillery and blocked by soldiers.
Twilight Golems are immune to all tower instant kills, and have the highest AoE attack of any non-boss enemy in the series. In addition to their high health pool, they boast a whopping 90% armor making physical damage towers nigh useless. Twilight Golems should not be taken lightly when they appear, and should be a top priority for the player to eliminate. 
However, Twilight Golems carry an innate weakness: They permanently lose speed the more they are damaged. They can become one of the slowest enemies in the game when their health becomes low. On top of this, they are relatively rare and almost always come out on later waves, when the player has strong defenses. 
On Impossible difficulty, their speed skyrockets and they possess the second highest health of any non-boss enemy in the series, behind [Cerberus](Cerberus).
