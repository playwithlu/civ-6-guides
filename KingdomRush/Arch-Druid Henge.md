Strategy.
Arch-Druid + Golden Longbow Combo.
A combination of Sylvan Curse and Hunter's Mark abilities can do up to double damage to all enemies around the curse until the cursed enemy dies. When supported by and/or Runed Bears, it can cluster many enemies around the cursed enemy. This strategy can quickly dispatch commonly spammed enemies such as [Satyr%20Cutthroat](Satyr Cutthroat)s, [Sword%20Spider](Sword Spider)s, [Spiderbrood](Spiderbrood)s and [Gnoll%20Reaver](Gnolls). However, the downside is that this requires some luck for Sylvan Curse and Hunter's Mark to hit the same enemy, at roughly the same time.
