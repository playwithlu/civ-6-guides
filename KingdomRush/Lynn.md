Tips and Tricks.
Lynn is a melee physical hero that excels at weakening and assassinating the toughest of foes with the help of her curses. Her skillikit revolves around curses, which can trigger Hex Fury's coup de grâce in the form of bonus damage. Even without the help of her curses, Lynn is able to avoid all incoming attacks well, thus allowing her to block foes in melee combat with no exceptions. With proper micromanagement and timing of Hex Fury and Fate Sealed, Lynn will be able to eliminate a tough foe from the battlefield whilst potentially basking in the aftermath of glory that ravages surrounding enemies near her doomed victim.
