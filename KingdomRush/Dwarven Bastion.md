# Dwarven Bastion

The Dwarven Bastion is a found only in [The%20Dark%20Descent](The Dark Descent). It has two special abilities not unlike normal level 4 advanced towers. There are two Dwarven Bastions in [Campaign](Campaign) and [Heroic%20Challenge](Heroic Challenge) modes, and three in [Iron%20Challenge](Iron Challenge) mode.
## Overview

Dwarven Bastions are very similar to the [Musketeer%20Garrison](Musketeer Garrison) of the [Kingdom%20Rush](original game): firing slowly but with high damage from the longest range in the game.
Explosive Keg is a simple area-of-effect damage ability. Similar to the Musketeer's Shrapnel Shot, it is quite reliable, especially against masses of enemies.
Full Mithril Jacket, on the other hand, when maxed, boosts the tower's damage by a whopping 90 points, making it more than double in power.
