# Glacial Wolf

Glacial Wolves are wolf-like enemies encountered in the Frozen North.
## Overview

"Wolves created with frost magic. These dangerous creatures explode in a blast of freezing air when they die."
Glacial Wolves are similar to [Worg](Worg)s and based on the [Winter%20Wolf](Winter Wolves) from the first game, having similar speed, magic resistance, and the ability to dodge melee attacks, while dealing less damage and having the ability to stun soldiers with death explosion. They are fast, ruling out most as an option if not blocked; their magic resistance and relatively high hit points allow them to easily bypass towers.
When defeated, they explode into a freezing explosion that deals no damage but has the chance to temporarily freeze your units or Hero. They also tend to come in numbers, multiplying their threat. However, with a bit of strategic positioning and proper upgrades, these beasts can be torn to shreds quickly and effectively.
Chance to freeze: 30%, duration: 2 seconds, max targets: 2
