Out of nowhere, a cultist acolyte crashes straight into one of our group.
"W-w-wait!" he says, after we take out our weapons.
"Don't hurt me, I'm fleeing from 'them'... they truly are insane! I just want to go home..."
Options.
Ask for information.
Requires one of: [Oloch](Oloch), [Knight](Knight)
We hid away and agreed to let him go if he gave us valuable information about the cult's plans, which he did, somewhat hesitantly.
"By the way, take this... I won't need it anymore," he said before departing.
Intimidate him!
Requires: Mighty unit
We cornered him against a wall and told him that whatever pain the cult wanted to inflict on him paled in comparison to what we were capable of.
After he spilt the beans about the cult's plan, we let him go.
"or"
We tried to intimidate the acolyte by grabbing him by the shoulders, but he got even more nervous under our interrogation.
"Let go of me!" he said, before landing a sneak stab to free himself and quickly run away.
