# Redspine

Redspines are stout, muscular Deep Devil warriors that appear in the Rising Tides mini-campaign in . They seem to be a more powerful variant of [Greenfin](Greenfin)s.
## Overview

"The chosen of [Leviathan](Leviathan), these elite warriors lead lesser [Greenfin](Greenfin) into battle."
Redspines are elite mooks with high health and strong attacks that possess the ability to throw javelins, which are used to soften soldiers before going in for the kill rather than as a primary attack. Redspines are otherwise fairly durable and not very easy to kill (even at later waves), and, alongside Greenfins and [Deviltide](Deviltide)s, serve mostly to quickly get through towers and reduce lives while the [Blacksurge](Blacksurge)s and [Bluegale](Bluegale)s mostly concern themselves with crippling your defenses.
Their ranged attack deals physical damage.
Strategy.
Redspines supposedly have a very high physical armor rating, but this is actually not true, meaning that it's okay to use Archer Towers against them. However, make them as high-level as possible, as they have quite a lot of HP. When not blocked, they attack from a distance using their javelins, even against units behind them, but keep proceeding to the exit. It's recommended to stall them with Reinforcements and armored heroes. If you really wish to use Barracks troops against them, go for Templars or Assassins. Redspines, in addition to their toughness, deal quite heavy damage with each attack. With the Templars' high HP and medium armor, they can mitigate a Redspine's heavily damaging attack, whereas Assassins can conceal themselves until the Redspine is in melee range and then dodge his blows.
