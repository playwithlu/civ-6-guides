Description.
"An awesome hunter from a faraway land. He came here to prove himself worthy by facing the most fierce opponents. With his martial prowess and powerful weapons, he enters any battlefield without fear."
Lore (Sha'tra's chronicles).
The view from the spaceship window was breathtaking. Sha'tra asked 
himself how something so terrible and devastating could make the sky 
burn with all those glorious colors.
Soon the planet would only be specks of dust floating weightlessly in space, very much like his own homeworld. 
That brought the memories back, it was a long time ago, but those images were still fresh. The Raad had struck hard and fast. 
The proud race of warriors was obliterated before they could even 
realize they were under attack and their homeworld was blown to pieces.
Sha'tra only found out about this a few weeks later, upon returning 
with his brother from a hunting trip. The joy was replaced with 
disbelief when the radar of the spaceship could not find their planet on
 the set coordinates. All that was left was some burned boulders and 
scattered matter floating on in the dark void.
Sha'tra' s people were no strangers to death; in fact, they lived 
every day risking their very existence in pursuit of the mythical Stelar
 blades. The ancient prophecies spoke of reliques that could grant 
illumination and the power to bend space and time at their masters' 
will. 
The blades would only be revealed to the conqueror of "The Final 
Challenge": a confrontation so extraordinary and impossible that would 
prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that the warrior deserved such honor.
Upon looking over the remains of what he used to call home, Sha'tra knew 
what he had to do: fulfill the prophecy to restore his kin and 
homeworld.
Since then he parted ways with his brother, traveled to dozens of 
worlds, fought hundreds of battles, and defeated thousands of enemies in
 pursuit of that mythical battle.
Walking away from the window, he felt the sting of frustration; this 
last mission had proven to be a bogus chase, and he barely made it out 
alive. 
Those damned Raads had managed to burst the planet he was just on; it
 seems that their last encounter was still a sore spot for them. Nexus 
deserved to have more than a hand taken from him after spitting those 
infuriating lies about his brother joining the Raads. Unfortunately, the
 coward escaped before he could finish the task.
He maneuvered the spacecraft to elude the debris, set the autopilot 
and then headed to the locker to store his new souvenir. He had managed to
 collect one from that dying world, as he did with every mission.
His most cherished one was the red Jewell he had obtained a long time
 ago in a foreign land. He arrived by sheer luck while chasing those 
disgraceful Parasytes, and after quickly destroying them, he joined the 
hunt for a so-called " God." That Umbra character had turned out to be 
simply a nuisance, not even worth considering a satisfying rival, but 
the jewel that pulsed with mesmerizing light was a prize worth the trip.
He held it in his hands and let the burst of power flow through him, 
then placed it carefully back on the locker and returned to the pilot's 
seat. 
Now he was ready to let his hunter's instinct direct him to his next battle.

Tips and Tricks.
Sha'tra is a melee True Damage attacker specialized in picking off foes one at a time. His Energy Glaive, at level 3, can go anywhere from tickling one enemy to weakening an entire horde, due to its chance-based bounce. Purification Protocol can execute several foes already weakened by his other attacks or pour out True Damage onto a single target. His Vibro Blades help him to slay individual enemies, no matter their armor, which makes him a superb duelist. Abduction, at level 3, is an AOE execute that can kill any number of clumped enemies whose total health does not exceed 1000, or pick off just one. Final Countdown is not particularly powerful in and of itself but is often useful for the fact that Sha'tra is best used in the center of an enemy horde, and an unexpected death will hurt all enemies around him.

## Overview

"Coming from a far, distant world, the hunter Sha'tra is always on the lookout for the strongest opponents on the land."
Much like [Magnus%20Spellbane](Magnus Spellbane) in [City%20of%20Lozagon](City of Lozagon), Sha'tra does not interact with the level directly, instead he operates from a platform and assaults the player without ever being directly interacted with.
Sha'tra only appears on the last wave of this stage, where the center pyramid opens up to reveal him at a control panel. He taunts the player from his pyramid while his spaceship attacks the player by abducting units or destroying towers.
Once the final wave is defeated, his control panel is destroyed and he goes back into his ship.
