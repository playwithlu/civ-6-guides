Description.
"Long has passed since the prideful Deep Devils failed in their campaign, but a chance of redemption arose when Vez'nan requested their allegiance. Jun'Pai, the Conqueror answered the call, ready to serve and to do what he does best: decimate his enemies without mercy."
A long time has passed since the deep devils failed in their campaign for dominance. They licked their wounds, slowly recovering from their defeat in the depths of the abyss, waiting for years for an opportunity to strike again.
Much to their surprise, Vez’nan appeared in their secluded city offering them a deal: their strength and numbers in exchange for a chance to conquer a place to call their new home. Jun’Pai, the current leader of the deep devils, grinned while listening to the proposition, he knew this was the break they were longing for.
Armed with his best combat weapon, an ancient trident able to control the sea and its creatures, he set on his way to fulfil his end of the bargain. Such was the power of this timeworn relic, that all who tried using it died instantly as they got struck by the intense magic held within it. All but Jun’pai, the only one strong and enduring enough to withstand the energy running through his weapon of choice.
The battle now takes to the surface, and it’s high time to show the true dominance of the deep devils once and for all!

Tips and Tricks.
Out of the entire Kingdom Rush series, Jun'Pai is the hero taking the most roles upon his shoulder : an amazing crowd controller, a dueler, a decent tank, a ranged attacker (he can also attack flying enemies), a spell silencer and a healer. Although he does not excel in any particular role apart from crowd control, his skill set of great variety and utility, while possessing some decent damage and a low cool-down grants him competent power and outstanding versatility. Of all sources of silencing, Jun'Pai is the first to be able to silence enemies permanently. 
The reason to create a near death situation is because Jun'Pai heals by 10% of his health every 2 seconds. When his health is above 80%, the passive disappears. Hence to avoid excessive micro and free your hands, the longer his passive is active the better (this grants you 15 seconds of passive without Micro).
However, do take your own measures when: 
Jun'Pai gains a blue aura when his passive is active.
Jun'Pai seems to have such a large sprite that he is out of range of the death explosion of a Crystal Demolisher that he is fighting. However, he will take damage when he's engaged with another enemy, and the Crystal Demolisher dies while walking by.
