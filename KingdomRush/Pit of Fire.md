# Pit of Fire

 "Demons have ravaged our troops stationed at [The%20Dark%20Tower](Vez'nan's tower), leaving a lone survivor... From his terrified mumbling we've learned that these hellish hordes rose from the depths of the Rift of Cinders."
 "General, you must secure the area, discover the true origin of this threat, and make sure we have prevailed over Vez'nan."
Pit of Fire is the twenty-first stage in [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush) and the first of the two stages in the Burning Torment mini-campaign. It is available on Mobile and Steam.
