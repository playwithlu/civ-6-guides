# Hyena

Hyenas are enemies first seen in the level [Waterfalls%20Trail](Waterfalls Trail). They have the ability to dodge past any blocks, including soldiers, reinforcements and heroes, rendering those units incapable of slowing them down.
## Overview

"Fast and craven beasts bred by Gnolls to run past enemy lines."
Hyenas are one of the most annoying enemies in the early stages of . Though easily slain, they come in large numbers, and can dodge past soldiers: when Hyenas encounter soldiers, instead of stopping to fight, they'll speed up by 50% and run past the soldiers. This makes soldiers nearly useless, to the point of sometimes being detrimental against Hyenas.
In Impossible difficulty, Hyenas go from having Low to High magic resistance.
Especially in the [Heroic%20Challenge](Heroic Challenge)s and [Iron%20Challenge](Iron Challenge)s, Hyenas can cause hair loss. Since in these modes you only have 1 life, they are easily able to slip past your defenses for an easy win. Letting one in can make a big difference of succeeding or defeating the game.
