Description.
Centuries ago, The Winter Queen, a spirit of the frozen north, spread arctic cold all over the world...
Her advance over the lands seemed to be unstoppable. Warriors soon discovered she couldn't be killed as she was an incarnation of Winter. After many lost battles, the wizards of the [Stormcloud%20Temple](Stormcloud Temple) were summoned. They used the power of the Solar Heat quartz to contain and imprison her, putting a stop to her advances.
Until this very day, you can still see the statues erected in their honor on each side of the temple stairs.

Of all the bosses in the whole franchise, she has the absolute least health, at a relatively measly (for a Boss at least) 4000 hit points. Her main ability is freezing towers faster than [Svell%20Druid](Svell Druid)s, plus she can freeze multiple towers at once, similar to a [Blacksurge](Blacksurge). Furthermore, like [Ice%20Reaper](Ice Reaper)s, she will turn any units she kills into [Apex%20Shard](Apex Shard)s.
