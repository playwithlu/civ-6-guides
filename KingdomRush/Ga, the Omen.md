# Ga, the Omen

Ga, the Omen is one of three aspects that make up the evil spirit [M%C3%B3r-Ga-Nok](M贸r-Ga-Nok). It is one of the three final bosses in [The%20Wild%20Moon](The Wild Moon) in [Legends%20of%20Kingdom%20Rush](Legends of Kingdom Rush).
Traits.
 Ethereal Shield : When the HP of one aspect of [M%C3%B3r-Ga-Nok](M贸r-Ga-Nok) drops to 0, it gains a shield that renders it invulnerable to all damage. The shield is destroyed once all aspect's HP is less than 6.
Strategy.
&lt;tabber&gt;
Phase One=
Ga is the weakest aspect, so he should not be worried about. Remember this. There are 6 angles you can hit him from, and only the back 3 angles make Ga turn around.
Ga deals damage to obstacles and his allies alike, so manipulating his stance and position with knock-back and rotating him by attacking from behind before he attacks can be extremely useful. 
Phase Two=
Ga has hardly gotten a single upgrade besides a durability upgrade. All advice from Phase One applies here.
Phase Three=
Ga gets a new buff. Plus 2 magic damage to his main attack! He still is easily dodged, though.
&lt;/tabber&gt;
