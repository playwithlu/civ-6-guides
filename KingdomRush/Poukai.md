# Poukai

Poukai are giant raptors that serve as mounts for [Poukai%20Rider](Poukai Rider)s. It is unknown how they can support the weight of a human. They do not have an encyclopedia entry. 
## Overview

"Poukai riders soar the jungle skies, hunting any trespassers they might find."
When a Poukai Rider dies, his mount, now freed of the weight of its owner, speeds up and quickly rushes towards the exit. They don't have a lot of health, but fly very fast and cannot be stalled, so the player has to make sure to have enough towers to defend against them.
