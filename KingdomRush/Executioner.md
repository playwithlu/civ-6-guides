# Executioner

Executioners are gigantic brutes that appear in the desert stages of . They wield huge, blood-stained axes capable of killing its victim in one swift strike.
## Overview

"An unstoppable killing force, a strike from its axe delivers a swift death."
The first Executioner is encountered in [Buccaneer%27s%20Den](Buccaneer's Den), where he cuts a lane through the swath of forest to the eastern side of the area, adding another path for enemies.
Executioners have the unique ability to [instant%20kill](instantly kill) any soldier they hit, no matter their health, instead of the common area attack; while this forces them to kill soldiers one by one, they can do so very quickly. The only way to avoid this is the [Assassin%27s%20Guild](Assassins')Â ability to dodge.
Executioners cannot 1-hit kill heroes, but rather deal 30-60 damage in every strike.
