# Razorboar

Razorboars are vicious boars that live in the elven First City in .
## Overview

"These wild swines have awful tempers and enjoy charging, burning anyone in their way."
Razorboars have high health and damage (which increases proportionally with health loss; up to double), good physical armor and the ability to charge through soldiers dealing 80-120 physical damage. They essentially force the player to use high-level magic towers or [Forest%20Keepers](Forest Keepers) (upgraded with Ancient Oak Spears), as archers and other barracks can't deal much damage while druids are only moderately effective. Razorboars are brutal to any setup that doesn't bother with enough funding for mages.
Strategy.
Razor Boars only charge when friendly ground units are a fixed number of paces ahead of them on the path and the charge needs to cool down after use, so use reinforcements or maneuver heroes or barracks units to make it waste damage output. The charge damage is indiscriminate, so it can take out a lot of weak enemies ahead of it.
Place barracks in the back as the burning charge is disabled when close to exit. This way, the barracks can survive a bit longer.
The charge can damage enemies even though its intention is on solders. However, this ability isn't activated unless player's solders are in the way.

This enemy is possibly based off of the enemy of the same name from the video game Dark Souls. In that game, Razorboars are big, armored boars that charge into you.
