Description.
"Silent as the night, light as a feather and deadly beautiful. Too many have fallen by her charming gaze and many more by her fatal bow. When she's not buying the new seasons capes or petting some savage wildcats, you can find her in the forest, piercing goblin heads as if they were marshmallows!"
"You won't see her, you won't hear her, but hell you will feel Alleria Swiftwind, hero of Linirea!"
Skills.
Multishot 
 Alleria Swiftwind fires multiple arrows to strike multiple enemies. If the enemy is the only enemy in Alleria's range, the damage will still count as multiple individual arrows. ("Cooldown: 4 seconds")
Call of the Wild 
 Alleria Swiftwind taps onto the ground, summoning a Wildcat to do battle to an enemy. The Wildcat is a pure melee unit and follows wherever Alleria goes. Alleria can only summon 1 Wildcat at a time. ("Respawn: 20 seconds")

A young Alleria makes an appearance in , where it is revealed she is the daughter of the Elven queen and the last of Elynie’s bloodline. She features predominantly in the [Royal%20Gardens](Royal Gardens) where she is a secondary hero, locked at level 3, and unable to earn experience. She still uses her Multishot attack and while accompanied by a wildcat, it too is only a youngster and cannot block enemies.
She next appears in [Gryphon%20Point](Gryphon Point) where she shoots down onto enemies from a vantage point atop the cave mound but is otherwise just a part of the . After this, she departs the land and flies to Linirea to seek help in the fight against the Twilight Elves. It is presumed that she chooses to stay in Linirea, leading to her presence in the first game.
 Alleria fires 3 arrows dealing triple damage. ("Cooldown: 5 seconds")
Tips and Tricks.
Young Alleria is not very effective when sent into battle directly, and is best used when kept out of range of enemy attacks. She is especially vulnerable to the [Twilight%20Harasser](Twilight Harasser)s introduced in the level.
There is one spot on the map that Alleria can stand on and not only remain out of the target range of any enemies but can attack the path and deal with the annoying [Gnoll%20Catapult](Gnoll Catapult)s. This is the bottom right corner of the map, where the catapult emerges.

Alleria Swiftwind is an enemy found in , encountered only in [Silveroak%20Outpost](Silveroak Outpost). Previously a in [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush), she returns to fight against [Vez%27nan](Vez'nan). 
## Overview

Alleria appears before the level starts proper, riding on the back of her wildcat in the same fashion the [Call%20Reinforcements](Moon Sentinels) did in . After taunting the player she quickly vanishes and the level starts. Alleria does not spawn from waves like regular enemies, nor does she remain on the screen as a consistent threat. Instead she appears and disappears randomly during the level, drawing the fire of towers, shooting long-distance arrows at troops, and summoning [Elven%20Ranger](Elven Ranger)s to the path. If defeated, she will disappear prematurely only to return again at full HP. When the level is completed, Alleria is then captured by Vez’nan’s army.
