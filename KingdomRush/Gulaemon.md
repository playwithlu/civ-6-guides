# Gulaemon

Gulaemons are big, fat demons with small wings that give them limited flight.
## Overview

"Oversized demons with limited flight ability, able to withstand a lot of punishment."
At 2500 health, Gulaemons are fairly durable, though nowhere near the level of [Forest%20Troll](Forest Troll)s or [Troll%20Breaker](Troll Breaker)s. They also lack offensive power, having no ranged attack and only inflicting a rather modest DPS. Their main trick, however, is the ability to temporarily take flight, allowing them to bypass soldiers and thus skim faster through the player's defenses. Overall though, Gulaemons are not a huge threat, since this ability cannot be used liberally and is disabled near the exit. However, the Gulaemon is rather common in later waves of [Pit%20of%20Fire](Pit of Fire) and [Pandaemonium](Pandaemonium), appearing in clumps of 5 or more at a time. [Tesla%20x104](Teslas) are thus effective in dealing with them.
