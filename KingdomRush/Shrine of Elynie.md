 ""General, enemy armies have been deployed around our goddess' statue. While we speak [Mactans](Mactans) and [Malicia](Malicia) unleash their power to take possession of the powerful Tear of Elynie. The place is brimming with the ancient power that gave birth to our race giving out tired soldiers renewed strength."

 "For the Light! For Elynie!""

Wave Composition.
Over the course of the level Mactans will leave her position and descend onto the map, either trapping towers in webbing or covering the path with more web and laying Spiderbrood Eggs. She can be tapped on to stop her short of disabling towers, but she will not fail to cover the path and deposit some eggs regardless of how quickly she is tapped. If allied units are on the path that Mactans webs, they will be ensnared in the same fashion as against [Webspitter%20Spider](Webspitter Spider)s.
At the end of Wave 15, Mactans and Malicia will break the shield around Elynie's Tear, and together be transformed into the [Spider%20Goddess](Spider Goddess). This is not counted as a wave.
