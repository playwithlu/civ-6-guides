# Dwarven Gate

"Yes! My tower is back to its former glory. The time for our campaign is upon us! Those foolish dwarves, always nose deep into their piles of treasure, have no clue what I've got in store for them! General, prove you're not worthless, command my army and start the invasion!"
Dwarven Gate is the first level in after the tutorial [Vez%27nan%27s%20Tower](Vez'nan's Tower).
