Tips and Tricks.
Bruce is a physical melee hero that excels in one-on-one melee combat situations via dealing massive [True%20Damage](true damage) to a single target via bleed, with elements of group crowd control. Bruce's focus is on inflicting the most damage to a single tough enemy while on prolonged combat with the help of his skillset. However, while Bruce can tank exceptionally well against the toughest of foes, Bruce suffers from a poor heal rate over time and will die easily without the intervention of his units. Therefore, it is recommended for players to assist Bruce's frail means of recovery by supporting him with [Golden%20Longbows](damage) [Arch-Druid%20Henge](amplifications), [Arcane%20Archers](crowd) [Bladesinger%20Hall](control), and [Forest%20Keepers](healing). With the right pack, Bruce will be able to greatly contribute to a fight together with a well trained pack of fighters.
It is recommended for Bruce to be sent against powerful foes to deal the most damage to them, since his damage potential can often be wasted and counted as overkill against most weak enemies. Bruce's Sharp Claws deals [True%20Damage](True Damage) along with Grievous Bites, allowing him to pierce armor better than any other melee hero (except [Reg%27son](Reg'son)). While his normal attacks still deal physical damage, the bonus damage from proccing bleed on the target is so high that he can deal more than double of his normal melee attack range. This works well in conjunction with [Arcane%20Archers](archer) [Golden%20Longbows](towers) with the [Upgrades](Bloodletting Shot upgrade). Bruce doesn't have any area damage skills, meaning that he will have a hard time dealing with floods of enemies. However, this can be partially compensated for by King's Roar, Bruce's crowd control skill.
