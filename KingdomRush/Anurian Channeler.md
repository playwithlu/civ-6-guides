# Anurian Channeler

Anurian Channelers are ranine enemies. They are encountered in the Anurian Wetlands, the fourth [environment](environment) of , introduced in the Subaquatic Menace [Campaign](Mini-Campaign).
## Overview

"Apprentices of Anurian thaumaturgy. They radiate a powerful magical aura that empowers allies close to them."
Pink axolotl-people with pink magic staves, these Anurians are capable of attacking with ranged magic. Unlike their [Anurian%20Infuser](Infuser) counterparts, their ability is a passive but short-ranged aura meaning that it will stay active even if they are blocked. This aura doubles the damage dealt by [Anurian%20Erudite](Anurian Erudites) and grants a low armor rating to [Crystal%20Demolisher](Crystal Demolishers) that stacks per Channeler, making both into far more dangerous opponents, and the Channelers will usually appear alongside those enemies. 
A Channeler's melee attack is higher and comes out faster than their ranged attack, meaning that stalling them at range is a better option.
