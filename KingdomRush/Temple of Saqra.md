# Temple of Saqra

 "We have him surrounded! The Temple of Saqra will be [Lord%20Malagar](Lord Malagar)'s last stand! The Ma'qwa is even fiercer here, where they worship their crocodile-visaged deity, and their own [Quincon](Warlord King) is leading them now."
 "The combined might of the Ma'qwa and their leader's magics is quite possibly the most impressive array of savagery evil might ever assembled! Fight back with all your prowess, my men, lest we end up as sacrifices to Saqra... or worse."
Temple of Saqra is the eleventh level in . The second boss, [Quincon](Quincon), is fought there.
On the sixth wave, an explorer with a striking resemblance to Indiana Jones will appear on the rooftops of the temple. Pressing the symbols on the wall in order (second symbol, first symbol, third symbol) will allow him to escape the temple, triggering a boulder trap that crushes the [Parasyte](Parasyte) eggs.
