# Imperial Guard

The Imperial Guard are powerful soldiers that only appear in Level 6, [The%20Citadel](The Citadel). They resemble [Holy%20Order](paladins), but are larger and wear a violet cape. While a paladin can only do 12-18 damage, an Imperial Guard can do 10-30 damage. Imperial Guards are also affected by Barracks [upgrades](upgrades), and are not replaceable if killed.
The chokepoints to the right and left have two Guards each, and the exit path has an additional three. They heal 25 HP per second when idle.
