# War Elephant

War Elephant is an enemy found in , first encountered in [Hammerhold%20Streets%20%28DLC%29](Hammerhold Streets (DLC)).
## Overview

"The equivalent to a bunker with legs, the armored elephants provide archers with a deadly combination of defence and mobility."
Strategy.
The first mini-boss to be encountered outside of any Endless level in the series apart from Cerberus, Elephants are horrifically durable foes who make their presence known with constant trumpeting. They are extremely slow, but have incredibly high physical armor and health, and these Elephants carry legion archers that constantly hit enemies in range.
These units cannot be engaged by troops, and will trample nearby troops at a rate of 11 damage every 0.2s.
As mini-bosses, numerous abilities and instant kills will be ineffective on them, so fighting them without amplified [Blazing%20Gem](Blazing Gems) and/or heroes with magic attacks would be close to suicidal. Even the former option will be quite challenging in The Grand Arena as some Elephants may spawn rather early in the wave cycle.
In the Iron Challenge of Hammerhold Streets, the "only" source of magic damage can ever come from heroes or the shop in Mobile, making them almost unstoppable. Alternatively, [Asra](Asra's) Quiver of Sorrow will work wonders on the beasts' armor, making them far easier for Swamp Things to kill them from afar, but a lot of micromanagement will be necessary. The sheer physical DPS of Arrow Storm paired with micromanagement will also be able to kill them, but only barely.
With vastly improved damage from an early 2024 patch update, the [Wicked%20Sisters](Wicked Sisters)' poison and their Nimbus 4000-enhanced rally points make them quite viable against the beasts.
