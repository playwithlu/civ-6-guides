# Crossbow Fort

The Crossbow Fort is an advanced that appears in . It shoots farther and faster than the [Tribal%20Axethrowers](Tribal Axethrowers) but deals less individual damage per shot.
Description.
"Trained under monastic discipline, these crossbow furies are masters of their craft."
The Crossbow Fort is a highly versatile unit that not only offers strong ranged DPS, but also can significantly boost all towers in range.
The Crossbow Fort has great range, and while less powerful than the Tribal Axethrowers it can deal its damage over a longer period of time. However, what distinguishes the Crossbow Fort are its great abilities.
Barrage has huge damage output, quickly firing a set of bolts that deal moderately high damage. They can retarget nearby foes within a limited angle. and also that barrage has a short cooldown. This practically doubles the Crossbow Fort's DPS, letting it readily weaken lesser foes or punch a hole in a bulkier fiend's health.
On the other hand, the Crossbow Fort also has Falconer. Falconer raises the Crossbow Fort's range and critical hit rate, making it more efficient (especially with the rapid fire rate of Barrage), but that isn't why it is useful. Falconer also boosts the range of "other "towers in range (this includes towers that fall in its range after the Falconer upgrade). As such, the Crossbow Fort has a useful support role than gives towers substantially more range and affords the player much more flexibility with creating chokepoints. Note that only the Crossbow Fort gets the critical hit chance, while all towers get the range boost.
It's worth noting that without its abilities, the Crossbow Fort is not particularly useful. Furthermore, while Barrage is strong and deals heavy damage, it is still physical, making it much weaker against armored foes. On top of that, Barrage has limited range when it comes to retargeting, potentially leading to missed shots if foes are spread out.
