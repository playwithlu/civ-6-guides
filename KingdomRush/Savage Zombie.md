Savage Zombies are zombies raised by [Blood%20Trickster](Blood Trickster)s from the corpses of other savages in .
## Overview

"Reanimated fallen savages, they crave only brains... and plants."
Zombies are effectively 'second lives' of savages - they move slowly, but hit hard, have a lot of health and give no [Gold](Gold), making them very obnoxious. As their Blood Trickster masters are usually in the back rows shielded by other savages, they can easily raise a lot of zombies before being killed. If you don't use [Rain%20of%20Fire](Rain of Fire) or keep them busy with [Call%20Reinforcements](reinforcements), your defenses might very well be overrun by mindless voodoo zombies.
Savage Zombies' corpses can't be reused by Blood Tricksters a seconds time to create more zombies. However, [Necromancer%20Tower](Necromancer Tower)s can use them to make [skeleton](skeleton)s.
Savages destroyed by Artillery do not have any corpses (as they are literally blown apart rather than pierced by projectiles) so Artillery can be used to counter these enemies.
