Options.
Rest near the plants.
"Resting amidst the healstalks while exchanging stories with the old man was an amazingly refreshing experience."
"We thanked the man and resumed our journey."
Ask for a whole plant..
"We asked the man to harvest a healstalk, as we were on a mission to save the forest from the dark influence of the Coven. After thinking for a while, the man let us consume a plant, greatly replenishing our energies."
""You better return the favor to the forest!" he said, before we resumed our mission."
Move on..
"We told the old man we were in a hurry, as we had to continue our mission to save the forest. He quickly sprinted his hut and came back with a flask in his hands."
"“Take these and, please, save this forest for all of us!” he said, before we resumed our journey."
