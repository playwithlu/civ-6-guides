# Shadow Champion

Shadow Champions are deadly, fire wielding balrogs. They were called Champions on the mobile version.
## Overview

"They are the sons of [Godieth](Godieth). Their power infuses fear even in the bravest of soldiers."
Shadow Champions are large, difficult to kill enemies with lots of HP, heavy armor, and a powerful area attack. Upon dying (unless ), they vanish in a whoosh of orange flames and blood, poisoning nearby soldiers and dealing 80 damage–divided into 8 times–over 3 seconds. If afflicted soldiers get killed either by it or by other ways, they are turned into [Shadowspawn](Shadowspawn). Besides that, Blood Pact affects nearby allies by fully regenerating their health and permanently increasing damage by 20%, excluding themselves and Godieth. The effect also causes affected enemies to emit a full red glow below them.
In addition, like [Twilight%20Golem](Twilight Golem)s, they are immune to any form of [instant%20kill](instant kill) aside from [Reg%27son](Reg'son)'s Vindicator spell and Wrath of Elynie.
