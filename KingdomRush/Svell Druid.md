## Overview

"The magic of the mountain flows through their veins. They're able to freeze entire villages with their power. (Tower freeze - cooldown: 12 seconds, duration: 4 seconds)"
Svell Druids are slow-moving bearded old men with a good amount of health and magic resistance. They have a ranged attack and are capable of disabling towers like the Blacksurge by freezing them if not blocked. However they can only disable one at a time and the tower can be freed via tapping it enough. This is usually an annoyance as the tower frees itself over time, but it can allow enemies to slip through undamaged.
