# Anurian Infuser

Anurian Infusers are ranged spellcasters. They are encountered in the Anurian Wetlands, the fourth [environment](environment) of , introduced in the Subaquatic Menace [Campaign](Mini-Campaign). 
## Overview

"Apprentices of Anurian thaumaturgy. They're capable of infusing their magical essence to allies with powerful effects."
Blue Axolotl-people with blue magic staves, these Anurians attack with ranged magic and can infuse [Anurian%20Warden](Anurian Wardens) and [Crystal%20Amphiptere](Crystal Amphipteres) with magic, casting a shield of 200 HP to the former, and tripling the speed of the latter for 2 seconds. They can also infuse the [Infusion%20Crystal](Infusion Crystals) with magic (will take a few seconds), and if successful this will disable a random tower for a period of time. All these abilities make them very dangerous and a top priority to take out or interrupt. Thankfully, their HP and damage output are quite low.
