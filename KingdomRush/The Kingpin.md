# The Kingpin

The Kingpin is the of the Rise of the Bandits mini-[campaign](campaign) in [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush).
## Overview

"The slickest and most greedy vandal in the kingdom. Rest for sure he'll try to steal your money!"
The Kingpin, instead of following the road, just rolls straight from the eastern entrance to the western exit, crushing the barricades (and everything else) on the way; however, he moves very slowly even for a boss. Every 10 seconds, the Kingpin will stop moving for a moment to chew on a gigantic chicken, restoring 500 health. He can even instead throw money around to deplete player's gold in hundreds. Even though both the Kingpin's health and speed are subpar, his short path still allows him to escape relatively fast.
