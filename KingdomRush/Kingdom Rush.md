Description.
Kingdom Rush follows the formula of a typical tower-defense game. Placing towers on the side of a path to destroy enemies that appear in predetermined waves, the objective is to defeat all the waves before they reach the end of the path, using the towers and certain abilities. Letting too many enemies through results in a Game Over.
Kingdom Rush expands on the usual set up by using a limited number of tower types, while introducing that engage [enemies](enemies) on the path and including bosses. As levels progress new towers and further upgrades are unlocked. [Heroes](Heroes) are used as unique units that can be directed around the level. Heroes have special moves that increase in strength as they gain experience through a level, and will return after a while if defeated.
Story.
The story of Kingdom Rush unfolds as each level is started, with a basic introduction to the stage written as instructions to you, the nameless General in the King's forces. From the first stage, a small town on the coast under attack by roaming outlaws, the game follows a route through the Kingdom and beyond, fighting off an invading force led by the main antagonist; and ultimately final boss; the dark wizard [Vez%27nan](Vez'nan).
Gameplay.
Starting a new game first offers you a choice of [difficulty](difficulty). Casual, Normal and Veteran. The difficulty changes the Hit Points (or HP) of the enemies. The difficulty level can also be changed before starting each stage. Each stage is represented on a map of the Kingdom, and upon selecting one you are briefed with a basic idea of what to expect before you can begin the level. There are three types of game modes. The default and main mode is [Campaign](Campaign), the story mode of the game. After this mode has been beaten with a 3-star rating, two new modes are unlocked: [Heroic%20Challenge](Heroic Challenge) and [Iron%20Challenge](Iron Challenge). These new modes offer different types of challenges, by changing the waves, enemies or towers available.
A completed level is awarded stars based on how successfully it has been played. The number of lives remaining (out of 20) determines how many stars are awarded, with three stars for a great play (18-20 lives remaining), two for an average play (6-17 lives remaining), and one for a poor play (1-5 remaining). Failing to keep all lives will result in defeat. In Heroic and Iron challenge modes, there is only 1 life and beating the modes award 1 star each.
Stars earned can be spent on [Upgrades](Upgrades). Each upgrade requires between 1 and 4 stars and have a permanent effect on towers and spells. Upgrades can be bought and reset at any point during the game, allowing you to pick and choose the best upgrades for each level until you have enough Stars to buy all of them. There are six upgrade paths: one for each of the basic tower types (, , and ), and for the two spells ([Rain%20of%20Fire](Rain of Fire) and [Call%20Reinforcements](Call Reinforcements)).
