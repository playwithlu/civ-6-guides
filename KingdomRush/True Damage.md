# True Damage

True Damage refers to certain attacks that deal neither physical nor magical damage, but affect all units equally. This concept was first discussed on the [http%3A//www.ironhidegames.com/forums/index.php](Ironhide Game Forums) before being confirmed by the developers themselves.
Description.
True Damage ignores any armor or magic resistance that an enemy has, so the damage inflicted is the same across the board, no matter how powerful the enemy might otherwise be. True Damage will affect both a [Dark%20Slayer](Dark Slayer) and a [Spider%20Matriarch](Spider Matriarch) equally (enemies with high physical and magic resistance respectively). Enemies such as a [Son%20of%20Sarelgaz](Son of Sarelgaz), which possess both physical and magic armor, will have both armors ignored. Examples of such attacks include:
General.
It should, however, be noted that some of the true damage listed below can be negated as even though they bypass armor, they are of certain types that can be negated by opponents with the right resistance, like poison and fire.
