## Overview

"Twilight elf warriors, trained in both melee and ranged combat."
Harassers are moderately durable enemies that attack from range with their bows. Their damage is not very impressive and they only attack from a distance occasionally, but they have an ability to quickly fire a volley of 4 arrows (cooldown: 10 seconds), dealing very high damage over a short span of time, able to kill soldiers and heroes alike if the player is not careful.
When engaged in combat, Harassers prefer to jump back a short distance, so they could continue to use their bows instead of having to fight hand-to-hand with soldiers. However, they usually only fire a single shot before moving on again. The shadow jump can clean them from negative effects such as the poison from [Venom%20Vine](Venom Vine)s.
