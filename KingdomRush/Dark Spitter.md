# Dark Spitter

Dark Spitters are grotesque beings that transform soldiers into servants of [Godieth](Godieth).
## Overview

"Corrupted creatures who spit dark blood. Their precision is lethal."
With a large amount of health and armor, Dark Spitters are quite tough to kill. They have a ranged attack in which they spit poisonous blood at units. Dark Blood deals initially 50-72 physical damage, then afflicts 80 poison damage over 3 seconds. If afflicted soldiers get killed either by poison or by other ways, they are turned into [Shadowspawn](Shadowspawn) (very much like [Drider](Drider)s' poison), allowing a single Dark Spitter to quickly overrun an ill-prepared defense with an army of undead. 
Contrary to their in-game description in iOS, Dark Spitters do not regenerate health over time.
