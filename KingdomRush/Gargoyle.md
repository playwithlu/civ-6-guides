# Gargoyle

Gargoyles are the first and most basic in [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush).
Description.
"Vile winged creatures that can fly past barracks and artillery."
Gargoyles are very weak and have no form of attack or special ability, except for their flight.
Strategy.
Gargoyles are as, previously stated, incredibly weak. With no armor and no means to attack the player's units, they pose a very limited threat. Low-level and towers will be able to dispatch them as long as they are adequately spread out so to reach all targets, but any advanced towers will vanquish them in seconds. If your Mages’ upgrades are maxed out, then the Gargoyles will be slowed down and your archers can finish them off before they get too far into the map.
The only time they might pose issues is if they are accompanied on the same path by lots of other enemies, causing your attacks to spread out and not hit all your targets. Also, any [Iron%20Challenge](Iron) challenges that prevent you from building Archer or Mages can be difficult if you have not upgraded your towers to a point where they can damage flying enemies ([Barbarian%20Mead%20Hall](Barbarians) with Axe Throw, [500mm%20Big%20Bertha](Big Bertha's) Dragonbreath Missiles or the [Tesla%20x104](Tesla x104) are the only way to cause damage).
