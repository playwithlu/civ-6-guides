Werewolves are durable enemies first seen in [Back%20To%20The%20Rotten%20Forest](Back To The Rotten Forest). They are quick and have a strong attack. Werewolves will make short work of most units and even weaker heroes such as [Veruk](Veruk), [Asra](Asra), [Oloch](Oloch), [Mortemis](Mortemis), and [Tramin](Tramin).
