Strategy.
This tower is an extremely versatile tower. While it has a slightly higher DPS (43.3) than the [Shadow%20Archers](Shadow Archers) (42) and is significantly cheaper (490 compared to 670), Bone Flingers have a shorter range and it cannot focus on one enemy unless it's the only one in range. However, its random targeting can be a blessing in disguise; enemies that summon minions, such as the Ice Witch, the War Wagon and the Lich, can be removed relatively quickly with this tower, as their minions summoned will usually move faster and block the shots for them. However, the random targeting also means it will be slightly unreliable as a last line of defense, as it will not always target the enemies about to reach the exit. 
When placed near the beginning of the track, upgrading base damage with Got Milk? is advisable, as it only takes 330 (297 with upgrade) gold to almost double its base damage (from 43.3 to 70), and it will be shooting more often than if at the back. This skill is nonetheless the core for this tower just for its sheer damage increase, even though in terms of gold-to-DPS [Elite%20Harassers](Elite Harassers) completely outshines them (700 GP for 72.2 DPS compared to 779 GP for 70 DPS), not to mention they also have a longer effective range.
Summon Bonem and The Walking Dead are better near the end of the lane. The bone golem and the skeletons serve the same purpose as barracks to stall enemies. The bone golem has a ranged attack that can be used against flying enemies which slip past your towers. The skeletons are a global support ability which walk up the path, so spawning them at the back of the path gives them the most coverage.
Upgrading The Walking Dead to level 2 is much more efficient; for the same price as level 1, you triple the theoretical stalling power. It increases from 5hp/s to 15hp/s of skeletons, not to mention the slight damage increase. Even then, it is still somewhat lacking in terms of control unless a good amount of skeletons are marching together.
