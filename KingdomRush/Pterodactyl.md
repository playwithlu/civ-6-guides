# Pterodactyl

Pterodactyl is an enemy found in , first encountered in [Lost%20Passage](Lost Passage).
## Overview

"Flying wonders trained by the Dwarves to be able to transport heavy things, and nothing is heavier than a [Prehistoric%20Dwarf](Prehistoric Dwarf)."
They may spawn transporting a Prehistoric Dwarf, which is why they are sometimes listed twice in the wave composition. They will drop the dwarf if they are brought below 60% Health or if they get too close to an exit.
Strategy.
Pterodactyls are reasonably beefy flyers that come in large enough numbers to prove quite a menace, especially when they transport Prehistoric Dwarves. For this reason, they can be either minor nuisances or actual threats to your defense.
If they carry a Prehistoric Dwarf, prepare your highest firepower for when the Pterodactyl drops its cargo. A Prehistoric Dwarf traveling over twice as fast as its brethren is not a pleasant thing to think about.
