# Troll Breaker

&lt;tabber&gt;Kingdom Rush=
Troll Breakers (Breaker on the mobile version) are enemies that appear only in the Winter Storm mini-[campaign](campaign) in [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush). They are among the hardest-hitting foes in the series.
## Overview

"Armored, combat-trained trolls, these brutes can tear through even the most sophisticated of defenses."
Troll Breakers are equipped with high area-damaging logs. They are very similar to [Forest%20Troll](Forest Troll)s and [Swamp%20Thing](Swamp Thing)s with very high regeneration rate. [Holy%20Order](Paladins) are the only way to effectively stop these brutes because of their high armor and healing ability. They seem to be harder to kill than their [Forest%20Troll](Forest Troll) cousins and [Swamp%20Thing](Swamp Thing)s, because they deal more damage, have a faster attack rate, and 60% armor.
## Overview

This very dangerous troll unit dishes out massive damage.
Traits.
 Ha'Kraj Regeneration : When not burning, Ha'Kraj Trolls regenerate HP at the beginning of their turn. HP Regeneration: 1
 Ha'Kraj Rage : Becomes enraged if an ally Ha'Kraj Troll dies adjacent to this unit. 
 Enraged : Ha'Kraj gain extra regeneration and extra damage. Bonus Regeneration: +1. Damage Bonus: +1.
Strategy.
Troll Breakers are very dangerous because they deal massive damage and can charge. They should not be allowed to become enraged and should be killed before a normal [Troll%23Legends_of_Kingdom_Rush](Troll Warrior) in order to prevent them from becoming enraged. To prevent them from charging, engage them in melee combat with a unit with high enough health to survive. They are not a very common enemy.
