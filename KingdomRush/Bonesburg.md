# Bonesburg

 "An endless night is upon us! Something wicked has awakened, plunging the area into darkness! Mindless horrors prowl the land in search of human prey!"
 "Our king has tasked you with protecting the defenceless villagers and finding out what is causing this blight... the realm needs you!"
Bonesburg is the nineteenth stage in and the first one in the Shadowmoon mini-campaign.
