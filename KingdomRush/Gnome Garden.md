# Gnome Garden

The Gnome Garden is a special tower that only appears in [The%20Unseelie%20Court](The Unseelie Court). It does not attack, but instead houses up to three gnomes that can do all sorts of tricks on enemies.
Description.
"Blinking Gnomes ready for trickery!"
The Gnome Garden is home to the gnomes, diminutive mischievous faeries that, every now and then, will teleport out of the garden to perform a trick on an enemy, briefly blocking it, then instantly teleports back to the garden before the target can react.
Initially, there's only one gnome that has two tricks – Pickpocket and Polymorph. The Gnome Garden can be upgraded for more tricks, as well as more gnomes.
The Gnome Garden is unavailable in the [Iron%20Challenge](Iron Challenge).
