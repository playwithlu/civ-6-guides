Demon Imps are the most durable in the main campaign of [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush). Their appearance is similar to the [Gargoyle](Gargoyle), except with red skin, white horns, a tail, and what appears to be black stripes on their backs.
## Overview

"Flying mischievious[sic] infernal creatures that are often seen in the company of gargoyles."
These enemies can be frustrating in large numbers, but otherwise are rather easy to dispatch. They have a lot of HP compared to other flying enemies, so the player has to make sure they have enough towers to kill them quickly.
