Tips and Tricks.
Karkinos' main playstyle is wreaking havoc within dense hordes of enemies. His high damage output is great at killing unarmored foes, however he falls short against well armored, durable ones, such as [Saurian%20Myrmidon](Saurian Myrmidon)s, despite his Pincer Attack ignoring armor. He also lacks a good crowd control skill and cannot stand for long against stronger foes, unlike [Alric](Alric) and [Grawl](Grawl). He has to be supported with soldiers and plenty of fire power, preferably to make up for his weakness against armored enemies, and soldiers to group foes, which will make much better use of him.
On a side note, Karkinos' extremely slow heal rate means that sometimes it is better to let him die without retreating him, especially when he is at death's door, because the amount of time he spends behind the line, healing, can be just as long as the period he takes to respawn.
