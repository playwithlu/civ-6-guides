# Hatching Grounds

Hatching Grounds is a dice challenge in the game [Legends%20of%20Kingdom%20Rush](Legends of Kingdom Rush) in the map [The%20Wild%20Moon](The Wild Moon).
We reach a glade completely filled with pulsating sack-like plants, interconnected by a network of glowing roots coming from an enormous blue plant.
We proceed carefully, as they look very much like the wicked treefolk roaming the forest.
= Options =
Destroy the source!
Requires: Mighty unit
We lunged toward the glowing plant, hoping to cut the life source of all the sacks.
Our idea proved to be correct, as the moment we slashed the plant, the cocoons started to lose their glow while wrinkling away.
"or"
We charged toward the plant but ended up tripping over the roots in our recklessness, triggering the spawning of various treefolk creatures in a chain reaction.
We hastily sprinted out of the place, to avoid being completely outnumbered by them.
Sneak around them.
