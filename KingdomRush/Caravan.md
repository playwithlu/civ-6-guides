# Caravan

 "Hire some mercenaries, my friend!"
The Caravan is a special manually-controlled tower that appears in [Lightseeker%20Camp](Lightseeker Camp). A rogue traveller offers the player deals on hired thugs, than can be placed anywhere on the map to help for a short time. For a price.
Description.
The Caravan offers two deals; A Small Pack for 60 [gold](gold) that recruits two [Bandit](bandits) to aid the player and rarely a [Bandit](Bandit) and either a [Raider](Raider) or [Marauder](Marauder), or a Large Pack for 120 gold that adds an additional [Raider](Raider) or [Marauder](Marauder). As they can be placed anywhere on the path, the Caravan acts as a form of [Call%20Reinforcements](Call Reinforcements) that the player has to pay for if needed. A mercenary group will remain active for approximately 18 seconds.
Bandit.
Strategy.
The Bandit attacks very fast (0.6s and 1 extra hit after 0.23s) and can not dodge the same in the Kingdom Rush
Raider.
Strategy.
The Raider is the only Mercenary that can attack flying unit, as it is the only mercenary to have ranged attacks. However, the raider loses their great armour like the original Kingdom Rush
Marauder.
Strategy.
The Marauder is the Tank of the Mercenary, they may distract enemies for longer because of their high health. They still have their armour similar to the original. This is also the only mercenary to have any kind of armour
