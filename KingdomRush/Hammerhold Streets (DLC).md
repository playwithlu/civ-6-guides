# Hammerhold Streets (DLC)

"Ah, the Gates of Hammerhold. I've got to admit they certainly looked impressive, but they were no match for a well-placed fireball. I am surprised Malik is not standing at the walls with his troops. It seems he has grown complacent as of late... as if Denas wasn't enough. Take the city, general!"
Hammerhold Streets is the thirty-fifth level in and the fourth level in the Hammerhold DLC.
