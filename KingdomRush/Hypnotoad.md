# Hypnotoad

The Hypnotoad appears in [Anurian%20Plaza](Anurian Plaza).
Description.
The Hypnotoad sits alone, at the base of the central-most Anurian Solider statue. Though content to mind its own business during the battle, it is more than meets the eye. By tapping on the Hypnotoad it uses it's powerful mind control abilities to stun all active and on the map for a few seconds. Heroes are unaffected, however, all other units present on the map will be stopped in their tracks for two seconds.
Strategy.
Two seconds isn't a very long time for stun to be effective, in addition to all solider units being frozen it doesn't provide as much of a help as it could. However, should enemies be close to getting through the exit a momentary stun can allow enough time to place [Call%20Reinforcements](Demon Goonies) or use a [Shop](Shop) item. 
The Hypnotoad vanishes after its time is up.
