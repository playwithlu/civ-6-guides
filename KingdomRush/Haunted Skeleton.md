# Haunted Skeleton

Haunted Skeletons are enemies found in the Haunted Wasteland, the fifth environment of , introduced in the Cursed Bargain Mini-Campaign.
## Overview

"Mindless automatons that obey the orders of their evil masters."
Upon death, they boost allies' damage by 2% for 30 seconds and also heal them 100 HP.Â Going off the printed stats in Steam, they do not seem to boost damage in that version.
In any case, between their respectably large numbers, hefty magic resistance, and their ability to boost health of other nearby when they die, only high-damage, single-target, long range physical towers and physically damaging heroes can be trusted against them, like [Shadow%20Archers](Shadow Archers), [Swamp%20Thing%20%28Tower%29](Swamp Thing), [Jack%20O%27Lantern](Jack O'Lantern) with Haunted Blade to remove the magic resistance completely and Spirit of Vengeance to ensure he kills them with 2-3 strikes, or [Asra](Asra).
