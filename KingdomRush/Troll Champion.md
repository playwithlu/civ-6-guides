# Troll Champion

&lt;tabber&gt;Kingdom Rush=
Troll Champions (simply called Champion on the mobile version) are more powerful versions of the [Troll](Troll) that can throw axes. Like the [Troll](Troll) and the [Troll%20Chieftain](Troll Chieftain), they regain health over time.
## Overview

"Elite tribal warriors equipped with vicious throwing axes."
Troll Champions have the ability to throw axes, much like [Shadow%20Archer](Shadow Archer)s. This forces the player to do micromanagement with moving rally points, or the troops will sit there and gladly take the axes. Worse still, these axes [True%20Damage](ignore armor), making the usual tanks - [Holy%20Order](Paladins) - much less effective, although the [Troll%20Chieftain](Troll Chieftain)'s enrage doesn't strengthen the ranged attack, and their melee attacks do not ignore armor. Of course, unlike Shadow Archers, they have a fair bit of health, and also possess the ability to regenerate, making it very hard to wear them down over time.
## Overview

They are the dangerous ranged units of the trolls and are relatively commonly found with other trolls in the Adventure.
Traits.
 Ha'Kraj Regeneration : When not burning, Ha'Kraj Trolls regenerate HP at the beginning of their turn. HP Regeneration: 1
 Ha'Kraj Rage : Becomes enraged if an ally Ha'Kraj Troll dies adjacent to this unit. 
 Enraged : Ha'Kraj gain extra regeneration and extra damage. Bonus Regeneration: +1. Damage Bonus: +1.
Strategy.
Troll Champions are dangerous because they deal massive damage if they are enraged and use Slice 'N' Dice. They also have a ranged attack. They should not be allowed to become enraged and should be killed before a normal [Troll%23Legends%20of%20Kingdom%20Rush](Troll Warrior) in order to mitigate the additional damage.
