Magnus Spellbane stands in defense of the [City%20of%20Lozagon](City of Lozagon), overseeing the battle and using his magic to defeat [Vez%27nan](Vez'nan)'s forces in their attempts to storm the [Denas%27s%20Castle](capital)
Description.
Unlike [Alleria%20Swiftwind](Alleria Swiftwind) in the [Silveroak%20Outpost](previous level), Magnus does not interact with the level directly, instead he operates in the same fashion as a battle commander found in an [Endless%20Challenge](Endless Challenge). He taunts the player and uses three different spells to hinder their progress. The structure he is on spins and a symbol lights up indicating which skill he is going to use.
It is also through Magnus' influence that three [Golem%20House](Golem House)s are created, and a [Toad%20House](Toad House) feeds on troops.
When Magnus is defeated, he is trapped inside one of Vez'nan's energy cages.
