## Overview

"Trains militia, tough soldiers that block and damage your enemies."
Militia are the most basic soldier available, merely civilians with very little training, armor, and weapons. However, with additional tower support, they can hold their own against even a much larger army. They can fall pretty quickly to Orcs, so it appears that they aren't as tough as the tower description says.
