# Mounted Avenger

Mounted Avengers (Avengers on iPhone version) are [Twilight%20Avenger](Twilight Avenger)s mounted on fast-moving, giant stag beetles.
## Overview

"Mounted on giant beetles, these Avengers advance swiftly and relentlessly."
Mounted Avengers have very good damage, fast speed, the beetle's high magic resistance combined with high HP allowing them to sponge twice as much damage compared to a Twilight Avenger on foot. The sheer damage, numbers and blasting curse of Mounted Avengers force the player to invest in archers, as they have enough HP to simply shrug off Druids' stones.
When the beetle dies, the [Twilight%20Avenger](Twilight Avenger) dismounts and continues on his path. For some reason, the Twilight Avenger cannot use the blasting curse until the beetle dies.
