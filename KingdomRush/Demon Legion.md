# Demon Legion

Demon Legions are armored demon soldiers with the ability to duplicate themselves.
## Overview

"Evil spawn from the abyss...Their name is Legion, for they can become many..."
As befitting their , Demon Legions possess the ability to create doppelgänger of themselves, which do not give any gold when defeated. Even though the spawn rate is fairly slow (compared to other mook makers like [Spider%20Matriarch](Spider Matriarch)s and [Saurian%20Savant](Saurian Savant)s), at 666 health and high physical armor, one single Demon Legion is already fairly durable by itself, so they can provide an enormous threat to the player's defenses, especially at the beginning when the towers and hero are not very strong yet.
Unlike [Necromancer](Necromancer)s, [Sand%20Wraith](Sand Wraith)s, [Saurian%20Savant](Saurian Savant)s etc., Demon Legions continue creating copies even when engaged with the player's troops and/or hero in melee. This makes it very difficult to stem the flow of enemies that can spawn from a single Demon Legion.
Unlike other demons, Demon Legions have no magic resistance, instead, they have high physical armor, forcing the player to use , which is otherwise more or less ineffective due to the abundance of magic-resistant demons in [Pit%20of%20Fire](Pit of Fire) and [Pandaemonium](Pandaemonium).
Their clones will have the same health at the time of duplication. The original Legion produces 2 clones at most, and these 2 clones can make only a single copy of their own. Thus, they can increase up to 5 folds in number.
Demon Legions' basic attack deals [True%20Damage](True Damage).
