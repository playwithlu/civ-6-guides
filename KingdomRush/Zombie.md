# Zombie

&lt;tabber&gt;Kingdom Rush=

## Overview

"Reanimated mindless corpses of innocent victims...brains are all they crave..."
Zombies are the basic enemies: slow, sluggish, weak offensive powers and generally pose little threat. They can spawn in high numbers, however, if you don't use [Rain%20of%20Fire](Rain of Fire) or keep them busy with [Call%20Reinforcements](reinforcements), your defenses might very well be overrun the masses of undead. Around mid-level, Zombies have too little health and speed to be a major threat, and serve mostly as cannon fodder for other, more dangerous enemies like [Abomination](Abomination)s or [Lycan](Lycan)s.

Zombies are the basic enemies: slow, sluggish, weak offensive powers and generally pose little threat. They only become dangerous when the [Moon](Moon) is full early in the stage, which gives them the boost of speed they desperately need besides spawning more of them at a rapid rate - if you don't use [Rain%20of%20Fire](Rain of Fire) or keep them busy with [Call%20Reinforcements](reinforcements), your defences might very well be overrun the masses of undead.
