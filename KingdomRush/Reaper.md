# Reaper

Reapers are the mature form of [Parasyte](Parasyte)s, spawned when a Parasyte kills a it latched on to.
## Overview

"A terror of unknown origin. Hunters from a faraway tribe voyage to try and hunt one."
Reapers deal very high damage, able to kill most soldiers with at most three swipes. Their magical resistance also makes them surprisingly durable. Worst of all, they almost always spawn in the middle of your kill zone when your soldiers are dead (because they have just hatched from them), allowing them to skim through your defenses, taking little damage.
