# Pirate Watchtower

The Pirate Watchtower is a special tower that appears in [Port%20Tortuga](Port Tortuga).
Description.
The Pirate Watchtower is manned by a pirate wielding a primitive firearm, dealing decent damage per shot but shooting very slowly (even slower than until upgraded with Rapid Reload); while Parrot Bomber deals 20-40 area damage and is essentially a compact [Dwarven%20Artillery](Dwarven Artillery) with a somewhat different reload mechanism: since the tower uses parrots instead of cannons, the bombs do not need to be reloaded but instead have to be carried from the tower on top of the target; so enemies at close range can be bombed constantly while [enemies](enemies) far away will take a lot less damage.
The tower's range is the same as [Dwarven%20Bastion](Dwarven Bastion)'s; the longest base range in the game.
