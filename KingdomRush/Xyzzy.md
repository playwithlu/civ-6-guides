## Overview

"The Saurian King is a colossal lizard that hammers fear home on his enemies."
Xyzzy is a giant [Saurian%20Myrmidon](Saurian Myrmidon), with fast speed and medium armor. He is the fastest boss in the series, as well as being tied second most armored, being beaten only by one of the [Ancient%20Ghost](Ancient Ghosts) and [Lord%20Blackburn](Lord Blackburn),and rivaled by [Hi-Hi%20Enha](Hi-Hi Enha).
Xyzzy also possesses a special area attack where he smashes the ground 8 times with his cybernetic hammers. dealing 10/15/25/40/65/100/145/200 damage on the first/second/third/etc. hit, for a total of 600 physical damage. Its AoE covers a massive area, reaching over a third of the map. This attack is able to harm [Ashbite](Ashbite) and [Bonehart](Bonehart), even though both of them are flying heroes. The attack has a cooldown of 5 seconds after Xyzzy is finished using the ability (this process takes about 5 seconds, making the cooldown from initial casting about 10 seconds).
When forced into melee, Xyzzy can catch soldiers with his tongue, swallowing them whole, effectively instantly killing them. Heroes are immune to this, but they will still take the damage. However, many are unlikely to survive Xyzzy's special area attack.

The Saurian technology story:
The Saurians’ rumors had been right: a god-like creature was roaming their lands!
Saurian King Xyzzy looked at the being that was standing in front of 
him. He could tell it was badly wounded as blood dripped from its side 
and its movements were obviously painful. It was clear it needed help 
and that was the reason it had approached their village.
Anyone would have thought the creature was easy prey, but Xyzzy had 
heard that even in its weakened state, it could obliterate any enemy 
with a blast of light in seconds.
As the blast surged from a shiny device the creature was holding on 
its hand, Xyzzy knew this was not magic. The Saurian had never seen any 
weapon of its kind before. However, he immediately thought that if his 
people possessed such power, they would become a force to be reckoned 
with.
Xyzzy slowly approached the being and signaled one of the tents where bandages and medicinal herbs were offered to it.
With this gesture, a bond was created, one that would change the 
Saurian’s way of life forever. The being decided to stay, and as a show 
of gratitude taught the Saurians how to create and operate its homeland 
technology.
