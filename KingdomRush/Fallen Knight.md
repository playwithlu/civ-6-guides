# Fallen Knight

Fallen Knights are corrupted knights that appear in the Curse of Castle Blackburn mini-[campaign](campaign) in the Steam, iOS, and Android versions of [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush).
## Overview

"Tainted knights who follow a dark path of blood and slaughter."
Fallen Knights are very similar to [Dark%20Slayer](Dark Slayer)s in [Vez%27nan](Vez'nan)'s army: sluggish but very powerful in combat, able to quickly cleave through soldiers with ease. However, unlike the heavily armored Dark Slayers, Fallen Knights have no armor but instead are virtually impenetrable to magical attacks with their 90% resistance, making high-leveled and essential. Even death cannot stop them, as when Fallen Knights are killed, they'll immediately return as [Spectral%20Knight](Spectral Knight)s, with the ability to boost their living comrades and complete immunity to physical damage; only when the Spectral Knight is slain is the Fallen Knight dead for good. The Spectral Knights' physical immunity and the Fallen Knights' high magic resistance make a very powerful and annoying combo when they spawn together.
