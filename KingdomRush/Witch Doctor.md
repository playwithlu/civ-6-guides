Witch Doctors are savage shamans, encountered in the jungle in , who possess the ability to heal their allies.
## Overview

"Aboriginal healers that use a secret mojo to heal their tribal brothers."
Unlike other healers ([Shaman](Shaman)s, [Sand%20Wraith](Sand Wraith)s, and [Twilight%20Evoker](Twilight Evoker)s), Witch Doctors are very competent at their job: they don't need to do anything to heal nearby enemies, while mostly still keeping the same healing rate. They are even capable of healing while engaged in combat, meaning that the simple blocking strategy will not be as effective against them as it is against other healers who lack this advantage. As such, they can drastically boost the survivability of other savages, especially [Savage%20Warrior](Savage Warrior)s, who can raise their own maximum HP through cannibalizing soldiers.
They can heal themselves and nearby allies by 50 hit points every 4 seconds.
