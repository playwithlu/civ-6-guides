Strategy.
These small, dangerous birds can pose a real nuisance if left unchecked for too long, picking off units and heroes that can't hit back. Either fast towers or area damage will be critical to wipe them out. They specifically ignore Dark Knights' Armor of Thorns. Unlike Cloud Stalkers, they aren't treated as ground enemies when they're attacking troops, which means that they can't be directly targeted by Artillery towers.
