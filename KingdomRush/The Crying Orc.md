= The Crying Orc =
At night we find a young orc crying over a recently cut tree. He doesn't notice us, and we can't help but wonder how he got lost. On the other hand, it could always be a trap.
Options.
Approach him.
He was pretty much defenceless, as he only carried a set of wood-cutting tools, but we walked toward him carefully anyway.
"Me mean no harm, warriors... Me strayed too far from me encampment, can't find me way back. Please... help!"
Give him directions..
We pointed him toward the path from which we had come. Luckily, he could follow it to a safer place.
He thanked us and departed.
Give him directions and help.
