# Raider

&lt;tabber&gt;
Raiders are heavily armored outlaws armed with throwing weapons that only appear in the Rise of the Bandits mini-campaign in [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush). Their physical armor is the highest of any enemy (tied with [Dark%20Slayer](Dark Slayer)s and [Bloodshell](Bloodshell)s) in the series (excluding the enemies immune to physical damage, such as [Ghost](Ghosts), [Spectral%20Knight](Spectral Knights) and [Phantom%20Warrior](Phantom Warriors)).
## Overview

"Elite armored mercenaries that fight only for the spoils of battle and the promise of [gold](gold)."
Raiders' extraordinary physical armor combined with a ranged attack essentially forces the player to use high-level magic towers: they are not very tough by themselves, but are nearly impossible to hurt with archers or soldiers, while artillery is only moderately effective; with 1000 HP and 95% physical armor, similar to the [Dark%20Slayer](Dark Slayer)s from the main campaign, Raiders are brutal to any setup that doesn't bother with enough funding for mages.
## Overview

Bandit Raider is the first enemy encountered in [Legends%20of%20Kingdom%20Rush](Legends of Kingdom Rush), and is part of the tutorial Adventure [Gerald%27s%20Great%20Escape](Gerald's Great Escape).
