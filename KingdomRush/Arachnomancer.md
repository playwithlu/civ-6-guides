# Arachnomancer

Arachnomancers are Twilight elf spider breeders with the ability to summon hordes of spiders to the battlefield.
## Overview

"Deranged twilight elves that breed and command hordes of spiders."
While relatively weak in terms of health and damage, Arachnomancers have an annoying ability to summon spiders with an interval of 8.2 seconds; starting with four [Spiderbrood](Spiderbrood)s, then three [Sword%20Spider](Sword Spider)s; from then on, they only summon two [Son%20of%20Mactans](Sons of Mactans) to the battlefield; the order seems to be randomized on Impossible Difficulty. While Spiderbroods aren't very strong, they are still very numerous and a lot stronger than the likes of [Spider%20Hatchling](Spider Hatchling)s and [Spiderling](Spiderling)s, and a horde of them aren't particularly easy to clear. Because of this, Arachnomancers are very dangerous - their hordes of spiders can easily swarm and overrun defenses if the Arachnomancer isn't kept in check. The spiders spawned by Arachnomancers do give gold. 
When an Arachnomancer dies, three more [Spiderbrood](Spiderbrood)s emerge from his corpse. While the summoned spiders give gold, the spiders summoned on death do not.
