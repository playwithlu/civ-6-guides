# Son of Sarelgaz

Sons of Sarelgaz are huge spiders, the sons of [Sarelgaz](the spider queen), formidable opponents that serve as her guardians. They are prominently featured in [Sarelgaz%27s%20Lair](Sarelgaz's Lair).
## Overview

"Deadly, unyielding monsters, Sarelgaz's offspring make for terrifying foes."
Sons of Sarelgaz are one of two enemies in all four games to possess both physical armor and magical resistance, the other being the [Paragon](Paragon)s. This makes them the only non-boss enemy to have this advantage. Additionally, they are immune to poison, like all spiders in the series. However, even though they might look tough, they start to spawn fairly late in the stage, when they are not very strong compared to the towers. Furthermore, they only take one [Lives](life).
