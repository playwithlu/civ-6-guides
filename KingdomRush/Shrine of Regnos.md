# Shrine of Regnos

The Shrine of Regnos is a special manually-controlled tower that appears in [Storm%20Atoll](Storm Atoll) and [The%20Sunken%20Citadel](The Sunken Citadel). It fires a very powerful energy beam that deals damage in a small area.
## Overview

The Shrine of Regnos first appears as a disused building. For the price of 500 [gold](gold), it can be repaired to gain the favor of Regnos, the Lord of the Sea.
The hefty price of the Shrine of Regnos is compensated by its pure power: even at the first level, it deals huge true area damage (250-750), which is very useful to quickly get rid of a lot of [Greenfin](Greenfin)s or [Deviltide](Deviltide)s cluttered together, or to wear down a tough [Bluegale](Bluegale) or [Bloodshell](Bloodshell).
For another 500 [gold](gold), the Shrine can be additionally restored to increase its damage; this can be done twice, and will additionally instantly recharge the Shrine. When maxed, the Shrine deals a whopping 1000-2000 damage: a [Blacksurge](Blacksurge) will certainly not survive, and even the tough [Bloodshell](Bloodshell)s will see their hit points drop abruptly. It is, in many ways, similar to the [Sunray%20Tower](Sunray Tower) from [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush).
The Shrine of Regnos is not to be used liberally - it has 30 seconds of reload time. A ready Shrine can be noticed by the glowing pink orbs at the base of the statue.
