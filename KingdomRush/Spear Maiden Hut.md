# Spear Maiden Hut

The Spear Maiden Hut is a special tower available in [Crimson%20Valley](Crimson Valley). It allows training of Spear Maidens.
Description.
"A tribe of proud warrior women ready for battle." 
"The maidens are known across the jungle for their unorthodox but deadly fighting style. "
Spear Maidens are decent fighters: they have good stats all-round and possess a whirlwind attack capable of wearing down whole groups of enemies at once. Possessing more health than any soldier, the Spear Maidens can easily hold the line for a long period of time against any enemy. However, they require good support to face foes effectively.
They heal at 30 health per second when idle.
Strategy.
The Spear Maidens cost little gold but are overall good, thanks to their high damage output, health, and area attacks. Thus, recruiting them is strongly recommended, especially early in the level, about wave 2-4, so they can handle the vast amounts of spiders than come with their Whirlwinds. The player should make sure to always back them up with one or more [Crossbow%20Fort](Crossbow Fort)s with Barrage in the middle of the map so they can shoot both paths. They deal large damage over a long range and compensate for the Maidens' lack of ranged attacks that target [Giant%20Wasp](Giant Wasp)s. [DWAARP](DWAARP)s are also really effective against the large groups of weak spiders due to their massive range and good damage, which will instantly kill any escaping [Spiderling](Spiderling)s.
Due to the good amount of health the Maidens have, they are unlikely to die and should last most, if not all of the level with proper play. However, a constant assault of [Jungle%20Matriarch](Jungle Matriarch)s and [Jungle%20Spider](Jungle Spider)s can wear them down by giving the Maidens no time to heal. The player has to pay attention when these enemies come. [Assassin%27s%20Guild](Assassins), when upgraded with Dodge and optionally Sneak Attack, can work as well as Spear Maidens, able to help them take down enemies and hold back foes in case the Spear Maidens die or have to retreat to heal.
Below is a summary of the strengths and weaknesses that the Maidens have:
