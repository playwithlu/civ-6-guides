## Overview

"Mirage's followers are trained in her fighting style. Not as skilled as their leader, but they are really dangerous."
Strategy.
Trained very well in the arts of ranged damage and illusory magic, these Hammerhold units can be a nightmare to fight. In Sape Oasis, they frequently spawn from the trees, sometimes very well ahead of the main choke points, even right next to the exits. They also deal highly formidable ranged damage and can jump backwards when forced into melee combat, just like [Twilight%20Harasser](Twilight Harassers). This can actually be used against them by barracks units and heroes to force them further back into the main choke point where other towers can hit them more easily.
