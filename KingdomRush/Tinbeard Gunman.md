# Tinbeard Gunman

Tinbeard Gunmen are slow-moving dwarves armed with blunderbusses that shoot at soldiers at a distance.
## Overview

"Gunners with giant blunderbusses that spit huge balls of fire. They fight from a safe distance to deal more damage."
Tinbeard Gunmen introduce the player to ranged attacks. Being the first such enemy fought in the game, they shoot slowly, do not deal a lot of damage, and overall not a huge threat.
However, they are quite nasty when encountered during the first few levels and waves, and you are caught off guard.
