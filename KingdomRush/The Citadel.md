# The Citadel

 ""After several days of travel, we have arrived at our capital city of Linirea. The time has come to make a stand, and defend Linirea's southern walls."
 "In addition to your highly experienced units, the [King%20Denas](King) adds two units to your batallions(sic). The [Arcane%20Wizard](Arcane Wizard)s will provide superior firepower, and the pious [Holy%20Order](Paladins) will inspire the troops with their bravery.""
The Citadel is the sixth level in the game comprised of seventeen waves and the first to feature a [The%20Juggernaut](Boss). The player starts with 700 [Gold](Gold) and fifteen [Strategic%20Point](Strategic Point)s to build on. Unlike any other level to date, this scenario features seven [Imperial%20Guard](Imperial Guard)s divided into three squads covering the most important choke points. The map features four points of entry; two to the west and the east, each leading enemies along the respective side routes, and two to the south leading through the central route passing the first line of defence on both sides.
