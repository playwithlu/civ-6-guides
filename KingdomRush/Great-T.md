## Overview

Great-T has various abilities:
Strategy.
Great-T is one of a small handful of bosses to possess magic resistance and a respectable amount of it, so even with 2 [Blazing%20Gem](Blazing Gems) placed next to the middle entrance where it spawns, defeating it will take plenty of time and effort. It helps to sacrifice a few demon goonies to slow it down while it is close to the gems. Otherwise, long range physical damage towers like [Swamp%20Thing%20%28Tower%29](Swamp Things), [Bone%20Flingers](Bone Flingers), and [Shadow%20Archers](Shadow Archers) are key to victory.
