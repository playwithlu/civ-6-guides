# An Unexpected Feast

An Unexpected Feast is a dice challenge in the game [Legends%20of%20Kingdom%20Rush](Legends of Kingdom Rush) in the map [The%20Wild%20Moon](The Wild Moon) identified by a leaf hut.
While making our way through the woods, we end up following a delicious, almost otherworldly scent.
Amidst the trees, we find three Sylvan elves setting a table full of exotic delicacies.
"Come, take a seat," they say with a warm smile.
= Options =
Inspect the food.
Requires one of: [Orc%20Cleaver](Orc Cleaver) (auto-success)
We poked at the food in disbelief. A feast in the middle of the corrupted forest? That sounded too good to be true.
There was something weird about the smell of the fruit; it was far too sweet, but it still looked really inviting. Maybe we were being too cautious.
Look for traces of magic.
Requires a Magical unit
Our magic revealed that the feast was actually the rotten carcasses of various forest fauna.
Their trick being exposed, the elves shrieked, revealing themselves as evil witches!
We fought them off and escaped unscathed.
Enjoy the feast.
We ate like our lives depended on it. After a short while, the food started to taste sour and stink. We felt sick and nauseated, and everything went dark.
We woke up hours later, battered and weakened. There was no sign of the elves and their table.
