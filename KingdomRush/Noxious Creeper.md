# Noxious Creeper

Noxious Creepers appear in the [Rotten%20Forest](Rotten Forest) and [Fungal%20Forest](Fungal Forest).
## Overview

"An aggressive predator, that hatches [Mutated%20Hatchling](Mutated Spiderlings) to feed on their prey."
They're about as big as [Spider%20Matriarch](Spider Matriarch)s, and have a similar ability. They hatch [Mutated%20Hatchling](Mutated Hatchling)s, which are a lot stronger than normal [Spiderling](Spiderling)s. They have toxic bulbs, that are similar to [Swamp%20Thing](Swamp Thing)s, but only on their abdomen. Noxious Creepers are very dangerous, due to having a pretty big health pool and decent attack. They can overrun unprepared defenses easily.
