## Overview

"A fearless tribal warrior with the scars to prove his rite of passage."
Savage Warriors are fairly basic enemies and aren't particularly difficult to dispose of. However, they have a bizarre ability to eat your soldiers after killing them, increasing their current and maximum HP by 50 (their maximum HP is capped at 600). Combined with the [Witch%20Doctor](Witch Doctor)'s healing aura, Savage Warriors can become quite resilient, so avoid using too many non-upgraded . [Knights%20Templar](Templars) outmatch them in every aspect, so they are the best soldiers to oppose them with. It is worth noting that [Call%20Reinforcements](Reinforcements) are excellent for slowing them down, as they cannot be cannibalized (since Reinforcements run away when out of health, as opposed to dying).
