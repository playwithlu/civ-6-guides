# Shaman

&lt;tabber&gt;Kingdom Rush=
Orc Shaman are tribal healers with high magic resistance and the ability to cast healing spells on themselves or nearby allies.
## Overview

"Tribal healers resistant to magical attacks."
Orc Shaman are the player's introduction to magic resistance. They can generally be defeated with a sufficient physical damage output. Alone they are not much of a threat, however, they possess the ability to heal themselves and allies for 50 health (Cooldown: 9 seconds) making them very annoying and difficult to deal with in groups. This ability has limited range so keeping Orc Shaman away from their allies with soldiers can help if the player doesn't have a strong kill zone.
## Overview

These are the first healer enemies that are encountered and seemingly the evil version of the Shaman Unit. They are found sometimes found with orcs.
