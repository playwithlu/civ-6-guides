# Bone Carrier

Bone Carrier are returning enemies found in the Haunted Wasteland, the fifth environment of , introduced in the Cursed Bargain Mini-Campaign.
## Overview

"An enormous construct made of bones. They never rest, punishing anyone their masters command them to."
They boost nearby [Haunted%20Skeleton](Haunted Skeleton)s, giving 50% extra damage. Just like them, they also heal when allies die (200 HP). This, along with the Bone Carrier's high armor and the Skeleton's high magic resistance, makes them a powerful and annoying combo, should they appear together.
