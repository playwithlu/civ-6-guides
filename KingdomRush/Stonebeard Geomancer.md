# Stonebeard Geomancer

Stonebeard Geomancers are large, slow-moving dwarves capable of turning themselves into stone in combat. They are first encountered in [Golden%20Brewery](Golden Brewery).
## Overview

"With their ability to morph into stone when they're fighting, Geomancers can soak up tons of damage."
Stonebeard Geomancers are rather hulking, muscular dwarves that are slow-moving but tough enemies by themselves. When blocked, they'll turn themselves into stone, which multiplies their current and maximum HP by 3.3 times (1320/1650/1980/2228 max HP); in effect, this ability transforms them into a giant enemy and reduces all of their damage taken by 3.3 times. When no longer in combat or stunned, they'll automatically become flesh again. Because of this, can be detrimental against Stonebeard Geomancers as they will cause them to take far less effective damage.
