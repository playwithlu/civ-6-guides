# The Sunken Citadel

 "With the Lord of the Sea by our side, we have prevailed in battle! However, the Deep Devils may yet have the last laugh: they have awakened [Leviathan](Leviathan), the evil deity of the depths they worship. If Leviathan attains its full power, there is nothing in the world that can stop it."
 "No time to regroup or recover, we must head into Leviathan's lair, the city of Ryly'eh, once the seat of Regnos' rule. It is time to defeat the Deep Devils and their malevolent god once and for all!"
