# Worg Rider

Worg Riders are [Orc%20Champion](Orc Champion)s mounted on black [Worg](Worg)s that only appear in Elite goblin levels of [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush).
## Overview

"Fearsome enemies that fight from the back of their battle-ready mounts. They dismount only when their [Worg](Worg) dies."
Worg Riders are very similar to [Winter%20Wolf](Winter Wolves) from the mountains: sufficient combat stats to outpace [Holy%20Order](Paladins), the good oldÂ wolf speed, the wolf's high magic resistance combined with the rider's armor. Worg Riders demand upgraded barracks, archer, and mages, because 30 average damage isn't pleasant, and they also have the HP to shrug off artillery shells.
When the Worg is killed, the Orc Champion dismounts and continues moving towards the exit.
