## Overview

"Vicious rodents with razor sharp teeth that can tear through almost everything."
Giant rats have low health, no armor, no magic resistance, but their fast speed and their disease can tear through the player's defenses easily. In addition, they almost always come in packs which makes them difficult to stop and may emerge from the [Trash](piles of trash) present in the Blackburn mini-campaign levels. Towers should be placed near those to prevent the rats from sneaking through. are virtually useless, because of the rats' potent disease which will cripple even Paladins in a matter of seconds. 
The disease deals 90 [True%20Damage](True Damage) over 2 seconds. In addition, it halves the damage of the affected soldiers, and [Sorcerer%20Mage](Earth Elementals).
