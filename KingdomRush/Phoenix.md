Tips and Tricks.
Phoenix is a flying hero that excels in attacking foes with her global presence of death and rebirth. Her attacks and abilities deal physical and [True%20Damage](true damage) in an area around Phoenix and beyond, designed to obliterate and decimate groups of enemies via towers and herself. Death is of no consequence to Phoenix, as she will not only rebirth in an impressively short amount of 5 seconds, but she can also make use of her death as a strong damaging tool, and harvest the deaths of nearby enemies slain near her vicinity as additional projectiles of true damage to further injure incoming waves of foes. Overall, Phoenix capitalizes on the cycles of death and rebirth to annihilate her enemies, making her the only hero that turns her death that was a liability to the player, into a potent weapon of destruction.
