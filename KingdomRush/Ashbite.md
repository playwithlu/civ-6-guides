Tips and Tricks.
Ashbite is a flying hero that specializes in lane crowd control and softening enemies. He is best used against groups, thanks to the AOE damage he deals, but he can also hurt single, durable foes decently, as well as hold the line against a flood of faster enemies. When using Ashbite, it is recommended to place him just behind your Barrack soldiers, he will quickly disintegrate the blocked foes with his fire, allowing none to leak through.
It is also important to guage your skill distances on top of micromanaging Ashbite, as Ashbite has an idiosyncratic attack pattern, where he can only use his regular attack on enemies somewhat near him, but not directly under him. His skills are also reliant and triggered on distances where they would not activate if the enemies were too close to Ashbite, with varying ranges.
Compare to [Bonehart](Bonehart), the other dragon, Ashbite has better individual DPS and faster recharge of skills, as well as a varied arsenal of weapons to suit different tactics. However he is inferior against large groups of foes due to the smaller AOE of his skills and lack of Unstable Disease's stacked damage. Ashbite's method of stopping enemies, Fiery Mist, is also much less reliable than Bonehart's Bone Golems, since fast enemies can still run through the mist rather quickly. Thus, it is highly advised to spend extra gold on soldiers when using Ashbite to make up for his weak stall power.
[Trivia](Quotes).
Ashbite apparently has never learned how to speak. He only roars whenever ordered to move.
