# Lightning Bolt

Lightning Bolt was an extra spell unlocked by buying the [Premium%20Content](Premium Content) on the Flash version of the original [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush). However, with Adobe Flash Player being discontinued, this feature cannot be accessed anymore. It electrocutes a single enemy, dealing [True%20Damage](True Damage) depending upon the player's aim, which can potentially instantly kill a [Dark%20Knight](Dark Knight) or [Marauder](Marauder), with a cooldown of 25 seconds. It is best used to catch lone leaking enemies, or as an extra source of damage against bosses.
Lightning Bolt cannot be [upgrades](upgraded) in the upgrade tree, unlike the [Call%20Reinforcements](Reinforcements) and [Rain%20of%20Fire](Rain of Fire).
