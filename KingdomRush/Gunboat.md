# Gunboat

Gunboats are special found only in [Port%20Tortuga](Port Tortuga). They do not have an [encyclopedia](encyclopedia) entry.
## Overview

A Gunboat spawns from the entrance west of the northern [Pirate%20Watchtower](Pirate Watchtower). It will then proceed to move around the tower to the entrance east of it, while every now and then stopping to fire on soldiers and heroes.
Gunboats have unlimited range, though they do not linger to kill all like other ranged enemies. Instead, they only fire several volleys before leaving. Letting a Gunboat leave does not reduce [lives](lives), but also does not grant the Gunboat's considerably high bounty. Thus they should be killed whenever possible.
The missile deals physical damage. Hence, armor will protect your troops, although the high attack damage means that troops will still fall fairly quickly.
[Knights%20Templar](Templars) with Toughness upgrade and [SCUMM_Bar%23Boatswain](Boatswain)s can take 4-5 shots. Although Gunboats cannot directly target [Ashbite](Ashbite) or [Bonehart](Bonehart), the explosions do damage the dragons if they are too close to other units.
Gunboats spawn very frequently in [Iron%20Challenge](Iron Challenge) mode: when a Gunboat leaves, another spawns after just a few seconds; sometimes there are even three Gunboats spawning next to each other. Gunboats do not appear in the [Heroic%20Challenge](Heroic Challenge).
Strategy.
The most efficient and fastest way of killing them is a well-timed [Rain%20of%20Fire](Rain of Fire). It is not a waste of [Gold](gold) to buy the northern [Pirate%20Watchtower](Pirate Watchtower)'s Rapid Reload in [Campaign](Campaign) mode. However, Parrot Bomber is not recommended for its high cost and low damage.
