# Wild Magus

The Wild Magus is an advanced that appears in . It is first made available in the level [Gryphon%20Point](Gryphon Point).
Description.
"The Wild Magus wields magic in its raw most uncontrollable form, dealing bonus damage on each consecutive hit."
Unlike other mages who fire slow, powerful energy orbs, the Wild Magus fires a constant stream of bolts which, while individually weak, increase in damage with every consecutive hit and can add up damage very quickly. This attack speed combined with the AoE damage of Eldritch Doom makes the Wild Magus excel at crowd control, normally a weakness of other mages.
Compared to the other level 4 Magic Tower, the [High%20Elven%20Mage](High Elven Mage), the Wild Magus is much better against large hordes, against whom the High Elven Mages are ineffective because of their slow attack speed and inferior DPS.
