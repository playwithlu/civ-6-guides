# Boulder Circle

The Boulder Circle is the level 2 in . It's upgraded from the [Stone%20Circle](Stone Circle).
Description.
"Heavier boulders to crush an even larger area!"
The tower doesn't change much in appearance from the previous one - the druid gains two green bracers and more stones and moss are clustered around him. The damage, however, gets a substantial increase - this tower deals about 2.5 times that of the [Stone%20Circle](Stone Circle).
