# Tainted Treant

The Tainted Treant (Treant on the mobile version) is an enemy that appears in the [Rotten%20Forest](Rotten Forest) and [Fungal%20Forest](Fungal Forest) levels of [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush). A small glimpse was seen in a development screenshot, and it was fully unveiled by Ironhide Studios after a user on the forums successfully guessed what it was.
## Overview

"With steel-hard bark, these corrupted beings were once protectors of the forest."
The Tainted Treant is a tough foe that can fight blow for blow with the strongest units. It is slow and only takes one life, so is not especially dangerous on its own, provided the player's towers are at a high enough level and able to target it. In large numbers they can easily let a horde through while they distract towers and engage soldiers.
