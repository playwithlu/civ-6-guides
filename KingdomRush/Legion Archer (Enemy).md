## Overview

"These master archers excel at long ranch, having tamed the hazards and challenges of the unforgiving desert "
Strategy.
The basic ranged units of Hammerhold are no slouches at what they do best: picking off targets from a very long range, often outside the range of towers that barracks units and heroes may be too close to. Combating them requires either equally long range, area of effect abilities, or complicated micromanagement of units since the archers will not move forward until there are no viable targets in range.
