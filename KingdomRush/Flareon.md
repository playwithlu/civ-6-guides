# Flareon

&lt;tabber&gt;Kingdom Rush=
Flareons are demons with the ability to throw balls of fire. They damage nearby soldiers upon death and are resistant to magic.
## Overview

"These vile creatures can hurl devastating balls of fire, and they always attack in groups."
Flareons are basically [Demon%20Spawn](Demon Spawns) with a long-ranged attack that burns soldiers, are faster, and have better magic resistance. Their ranged attack forces the player to do some annoying micromanagement with moving rally points, or the troops will sit there and happily get burned into ashes. However, Flareons are generally less threatening than Demon Spawns: they usually spawn later in the game, tend to cluster together (like all ranged enemies) making them vulnerable to artillery, and since they often stand at a distance from soldiers, infernal combustion is much less of a threat. Their ranged attack can quickly kill even some of the most durable , however.
## Overview

With a high range and a magic attack that inflicts burning, Flareons are weak but still dangerous.
