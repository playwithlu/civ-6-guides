# Saurian Darter

Saurian Darters (Darter on the mobile version) are Saurians wearing vests that allow them to teleport a short distance.
## Overview

"A rare breed of Saurian that can teleport by unknown methods."
Ground-based equivalents of the [Rocket%20Rider](Rocket Rider)s from the original [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush), Saurian Darters can potentially be the most irritating and potentially dangerous enemies. Health-wise, they are relatively easy to take down, but their teleport ability allows them to bypass soldiers and towers and cross unscathed to the exit. Plan strategically, and use your [Call%20Reinforcements](reinforcements) wisely!
