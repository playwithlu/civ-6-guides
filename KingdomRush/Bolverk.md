Strategy.
The most significant feature of his is that Bolverk can magnify the damage taken by enemies, so it is a good idea to bring him to the biggest clusters of enemies to use Battle Cry in order to increase the damage done by the most significant amount. Sending him to high-priority figures like aÂ [Shadow%20Champion](Shadow Champion) or [Dark%20Spitter](Dark Spitter) group to use this skill prior to a cast of [Thunderbolt](Thunderbolt) or the use of any other powerful attack from a hero or tower will make them more likely to slay these foes. As such, keeping him near the main hero is highly beneficial.
Twin Axes is a melee skill and does not do much more damage to targets, so its usefulness is negligible. It is not worthwhile to sacrifice Bolverk's HP to perform this skill, whereas Battle Cry is much more significant.
He has lots of health but no armor, and against the enemies in [Tainted%20Pit](Tainted Pit), along with the flying flaming rocks that periodically shoot out, he is frail and can die in seconds. Avoiding his death is not too significant because of the low respawn time he has, but it is still worse than having him alive to add that much more damage with his attacks and especially Battle Cry. It may benefit to move him with the hero so they can protect each other, and keep reinforcements ahead of him when he isn't using his skills so that he can be protected until an opportunity does arrive for him to employ Battle Cry.
