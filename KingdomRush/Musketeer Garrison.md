# Musketeer Garrison

The Musketeer Garrison is a Level 4 [Archer%20Tower](archer tower), with an insane range and solid damage per shot but high variance. Although this comes with a "much" slower firerate. Its abilities include the Sniper Shot, which can instantly kill any enemy regardless of armor, and the Shrapnel Shot, which deals splash damage to enemies in range.
Description.
"Patient, careful, and deadly accurate long-range deadeye shooters, with advanced weaponry."
Unlike other archer towers, Musketeers fire slowly but have high damage per shot. Compared to Rangers, Musketeers do less DPS, but have immense range and more specialized abilities.
Sniper Shot is a longer range, single target, high damage attack, with a chance of instant kill. It is one of the two tower [instant%20kill](instant kill) abilities in the game, the other one being the [Arcane%20Wizard](Arcane Wizard)'s Death Ray. 
Shrapnel Shot is an area-of-effect damage ability that has a shorter range than the basic attack. It is very powerful, but also very expensive. On Steam and Android, it is significantly more powerful due to being affected by the Artillery Smart Targeting upgrade, making it deal max damage on every cast. 
Abilities.
Sniper Shot.
 "One shot...one kill..."
1.5x range shot with a chance of [Instant%20kill](instantly killing) an enemy. If it fails, it deals extra physical damage equal to the instakill chance multiplied by the target's max HP in addition to basic attack damage. Sniper Shot does not affect or [Cerberus](mini-bosses) ("Cooldown: 14 seconds")
The formula for calculating a failed Sniper Shot's damage is: (Instakill% * target's current HP) + regular attack damage. 
Shrapnel Shot.
 "Eat grapeshot!" (Flash and Steam) "It won't hurt...for long." (mobile)
Short range (0.5x range) shot that blasts an area (96) with shrapnel, dealing explosive damage to all nearby enemies (including flying enemies) within range. This ability, however, does not directly target flying enemies (Identical to artillery towers). ("Cooldown: 9 seconds")
The attack is a cluster of 6 grapes, dealing 10-40 / 20-80 / 30 - 120 area damage each, for 180 - 720 total at max level. On all non-Flash versions, the grapes are affected by the "Smart Targeting" star artillery upgrade. With Smart Targeting, each grape deals 40 / 80 / 120 damage each, allowing the garrison to dish out a whopping 720 damage every time.
Strategy.
The Musketeers are best for stemming the flow of a few, strong enemies, while the Ranger's Hideout is best used for hordes of weak enemies. 
Musketeers deal less DPS than the Rangers Hideout but have superior range. Their large range means they can still be effective in places where other towers would be ineffective. It also means they can cover more choke points.
Sniper Shot's additional range and lower cooldown (14s) compared to Death Ray/Polymorph (20s to 16s). On average, fully upgraded Sniper Shot will have an instakill per 23 seconds (cd/kill chance). Sniper Shot can substitute for Death Ray/Polymorph if you need an instakill in an iron challenge where mages are disabled.
Shrapnel Shot combined with Smart Targeting on Android, Steam and IOS is the highest DPS ability in the game, dealing huge damage on a 9s cooldown. While it is range-limited, it can be used similarly to artillery, using barracks to stall enemies in a large cluster in front of the Musketeers.
