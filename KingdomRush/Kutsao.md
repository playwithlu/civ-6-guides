Tips and Tricks.
Kutsao is an unarmored but fast melee hero adept at hurting a limited number of enemies via hit-and-run tactics. He can hold his own against most enemies while dealing good damage over a short period of time; however Kutsao loses much effectiveness when overran with strong, armored enemies, or targeted by ranged foes.
