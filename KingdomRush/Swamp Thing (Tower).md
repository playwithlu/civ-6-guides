Compared to the [Dark%20Knights](Dark Knights), the Swamp Thing has much better survivability thanks to its high health, the ability to heal, stun foes much longer and have cheaper abilities. It's also able to handle magical and True Damage far better, since it does not rely on armor as much. However, the Knights come in pairs, can kill foes much faster with Armor of Thorns and their Brutal Strikes have a better chance to kill foes faster, since they come in 2 and have a faster attack speed. They also don't rely on their abilities as much as the Swamp Thing does, and are thus more effective in the early portions of a stage, when higher tiers are not as readily available due to a lack of gold.
