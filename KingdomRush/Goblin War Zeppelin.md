Strategy.
The zeppelin is functionally almost identical to [Battle-Mecha%20T200](Battle Mechas). Both are mobile, indestructible artillery with a significantly higher rate of fire and DPS that even rivals that of even single target towers. Both even happen to have an AOE slow effect which improves their crowd control abilities. The rally point and attack ranges give it a long effective range, making it an excellent choice for strategic points located far (but not too far) from your choke points. Goblin Scout can provide a significant boost to tower's range, but only applies to towers very close to the zeppelin, so it must be positioned carefully to maximize the impact. Sappers cannot be engaged in melee combat, so unless many ranged enemies are nearby, it's not a bad investment.
