# Winter Lord

Winter Lords are enemies encountered in the Frozen North, in . They were introduced in the Frozen Nightmare [Campaign](Mini-Campaign).
## Overview

"Spirits that have served the Queen for milennia, their power can neutralize most damage dealt to them. Their icy touch corrodes metal and flesh."
Ice elemental spirit warriors with the capability to nearly nullify damage from physical or magical attacks while inflicting permanent frostbite on troops. Their resistance (changes every 15 seconds) is signified by the type of debris floating around them, stone means they have physical armor, while ice means they have magic resistance. They always start with armor.
Furthermore, their attacks cause a frostbite status that deals extra 10 [True%20Damage](True Damage) per 0.5 second and lasts until the affected dies, meaning that they can kill even heroes should they hit.
All in all, these two abilities along with relatively high HP makes Winter Lords dangerous foes that should be kept away from Heroes at all costs. Only flying heroes, and the [Doom%20Tank%20SG-11](Doom Tank SG-11), sans the expendables, are safe from this fate. [Asra](Asra), [Jack%20O%27Lantern](Jack O'Lantern) and [Tramin](Tramin) can remove the affliction by Teleport or Rocket Jump. [Margosa](Margosa) can remove it by triggering Beast Form or by shapeshifting into a bat.
