# Twilight Avenger

Twilight Avengers (Avengers from the iPhone version) are ruthless, merciless elite Twilight elf warriors in .
## Overview

"Twilight elite armored warriors, they curse lesser beings with a blasting spell."
Twilight Avengers are powerful enemies with heavy armor and high health. They can sponge a lot of damage from Druids, Archers and soldiers, making Mages vital to stop them. They also deal heavy damage themselves, which is nearly doubled in Impossible difficulty.
In addition to this, the Avenger can "curse" all enemies except for Twilight Elves, magically turning a [Satyr%20Cutthroat](Satyr Cutthroat), [Satyr%20Hoplite](Satyr Hoplite), [Razorboar](Razorboar), [Redcap](Redcap), [Bandersnatch](Bandersnatch), [Screecher%20Bat](Screecher Bat), [Blood%20Servant](Blood Servant), [Gloomy](Gloomy), [Sword%20Spider](Sword Spider), [Webspitter%20Spider](Webspitter Spider), [Bunny](Bunny), [Spiderbrood](Spiderbrood) or [Twilight%20Golem](Twilight Golem) into a bomb that will explode upon death, dealing 80 splash magic damage to nearby non-Twilight Elves, allies and enemies alike. The only purpose of this power is clearing the path, so the Avenger can pass through the player's defenses. They also have a rather low bounty for their strength.
An important thing to note: The Avenger's armor rating drops to 40% when in combat, and when stunned, frozen, or otherwise incapacitated, allowing them to take some physical damage during fights.
One thing to note is that [Reg%27son](Reg'son), [Lynn](Lynn), and [Renegade%20Post](Renegades) are completely immune to the Avengers' curse explosions, being that they are all Twilight Elves.
