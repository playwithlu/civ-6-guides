# Dragon Nest

The Dragon Nest is a special tower that appears only in the [Arcane%20Quarters](Arcane Quarters). It houses a single red dragon egg that can be hatched to a baby dragon that will aid the player against enemies.
Description.
 "The egg of a red dragon, the mightiest and most feared kind."
After 250 [gold](gold) is paid, a baby dragon named [Ashbite](Ashbite) will hatch from the egg. Ashbite is rather durable, has a powerful attack, and a huge rally point radius, allowing him to be deployed almost everywhere on the map like a secondary hero, though he flies quite slowly. Unlike other mercenaries who must be hired again after death, Ashbite respawns 10 seconds after being killed. In addition, he can be upgraded with two special abilities like other advanced towers.
The Dragon Nest is unavailable in [Iron%20Challenge](Iron Challenge) mode: the nest itself is ruined and the egg (or Ashbite himself) is nowhere to be seen.
Ashbite deals [True%20Damage](True Damage) with his basic attack and both abilities.

Spews forth a cone of searing flame, dealing area damage. Cooldown: 10 seconds.
