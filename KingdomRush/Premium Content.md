# Premium Content

The Premium Content was an additional pack of content that could've been purchased for $5.95 on Armor Games, or 60 Kreds (equivalent $6) on Kongregate. However, with Adobe Flash Player being discontinued, it is no longer accessible. It is not available on the iOS and Android versions either, which have the [Shop](Shop) instead. These versions have the exclusive heroes as independent paid content and the extra stages unlocked after completing [The%20Dark%20Tower](The Dark Tower) on campaign. Once purchased, you were able to configure which features you'd like to have enabled and disabled.
