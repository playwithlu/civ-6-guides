# Camel Rider

Camel Rider is an enemy found in , first encountered in [Wizard%27s%20Landing%20%28DLC%29](Wizard's Landing (DLC)).
## Overview

"These veteran Legionnaires ride on the backs of loyal camels. Should their animal friends get killed, they are ready to keep fighting on foot to avenge them"
Strategy.
Camel Riders are fast units with good health and damage that can pose a serious problem to choke points without sufficient stalling units. They may also appear in sizable numbers to swarm a defense. Worse still, the legionnaires riding them will dismount after their camels are slain to keep fighting just like [Worg%20Rider](Worg Riders) and [Mounted%20Avenger](Mounted Avengers). The main saving grace is they have no resistance of any kind.
