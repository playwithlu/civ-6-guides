## Overview

"The vanguards of Linirean forces, their heavy shields can stop nearly any physical attack."
Huge Linirean guards carrying maces and equally huge shields, Shieldbearers have a lot of HP and some of the highest armor in the game, but only when not in combat. They are simliar to the enemy [Twilight%20Avenger](Twilight Avenger) from where the armor drops when blocked. Unlike Avenger, Shieldbearer has no armor while blocked by soldiers, reinforcements, or heroes, making archers and artilleries effective to them while they are blocked. Otherwise, they have high armor, making mages absolutely vital to stop them.
