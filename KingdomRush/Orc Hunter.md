Strategy.
These enemies are not that hard to kill, but their prodigiously long range can make them big threats if left unchecked for too long without sufficient armor to resist them. It is best to use magic or true damage to kill them. Be wary of the sleeping arrow, but chances are you'll be woken up if you manage to get hit by it.
