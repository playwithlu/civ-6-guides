The Encyclopedia consists of four sections:
The Towers page consists of all of the provided information for the four main towers in the game.

It updates whenever a new tower becomes available.
[Enemies](Enemies).
The Enemies page features almost all the enemies that appear in the game as well as the bosses. It lists their statistics and special abilities, and updates whenever a new enemy is encountered. It only features enemies that have info boxes appear in the levels when they appear, so some enemies such as the rider-less [Poukai](Poukai), [Gunboat](Gunboat) or [Endless%20Challenge](Chiefs of Endless Challenges) do not appear. This article lists all enemies, in all three series, regardless if they appear in the encyclopedia entry or not.
