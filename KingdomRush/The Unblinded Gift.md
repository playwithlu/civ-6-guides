= The Unblinded Gift =
We encounter a robed man standing atop a cult's altar.
"Well met, pilgrims. Hast ye come to have the unblind'd gift bestow'd upon you?
The land is teeming with our sacred glare, ano the observant highness forsakes not those who accept the unblind'd gift."
Options.
Accept the gift..
The cultist raised his hands and a swarm of spectral flies flew from under his hood into our mouths.
We waited to see what gift would be bestowed upon us.
"The Unblind'd highness hath bestow'd upon you the gift of steel. May ye carry the burdens of the shady blade with the same strength as ye strike your foes."

"or"
"The Unblind'd highness hath bestow'd upon you the gift of sturdiness.
Ye shall carry upon your shoulders the weight of serving our unblind'd ways, but none shall hurt those shoulders."
Refuse and move on..
The cultist shakes his head in disapproval.
"If only ye knew the power it giveth to the unblind'd ones.
Move along, then. The unblind'd hath no use for unfaithful ones.
Ye will regret your decision, for this here land will be ours!"
Attack him..
We charged up the altar's stairs only to find both the cultist and the altar vanish in front of us.
We don't know if the altar disappeared before us or if it was an illusion all along.
