# Mecha Factory

The Mecha Factory appears in [Clockwork%20Factory](Clockwork Factory). 
Description.
In the top right corner of the map, the Mecha Factory appears to be a part of the background scenery. It's not until wave eight that the factory begins operating. A dwarf is lifted into the factory from a platform on the right, the lights turn on and sparks begin to fly. The result is a fully built [MechaDwarf%20MK.9](MechaDwarf MK.9) emerging, and making its way to the left-hand exit by going in the opposite direction to the rest of the waves.
Strategy.
The making of the [MechaDwarf%20MK.9](MechaDwarf MK.9)s cannot be stopped, so it should be treated like another enemy entry point. 
It is advised to build and near the left exit to stop them.
