# Volcano

 
The volcano is a feature of the ancient city of the [Ma%27qwa%20Urqu](Ma'qwa Urqu). 
Description.
In [Campaign](Campaign) Mode, the volcano alone is no threat. Upon reaching Wave 5 (Wave 4 on Steam), a [Savage%20Brute](Savage Brute) will emerge from the upper western hut, with a damsel in distress thrown over his shoulder. The brute will take a slow journey to the edge of the volcano, stopping along the way to pose. If he gets to the edge without being defeated, he'll throw the princess in and start off a chain of events.
The volcano will erupt sending balls of molten rock onto your troops dealing 100 (20-30 damage on Flash) damage in an area of effect. To prevent the volcano from erupting, defeat the Brute before he gets there. Certain towers such as a [Crossbow%20Fort](Crossbow Fort) can reach the Brute and kill him. The plateau and the wooden bridge are also accessible by any [Hero](Hero), and [Call%20Reinforcements](Call Reinforcements) or even a [Rain%20of%20Fire](Rain of Fire) can also be used to stop the Brute. 
In [Heroic%20Challenge](Heroic Challenge) mode, a Savage Brute spawns every wave. In [Iron%20Challenge](Iron Challenge) mode, they do not spawn - the volcano activates on its own unless it's in the Steam version.
