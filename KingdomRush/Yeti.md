# Yeti

&lt;tabber&gt;Kingdom Rush=
Yetis are extremely durable winter beasts that can damage multiple opponents simultaneously.
## Overview

"Large ape-man like creature that can obliterate scores of soldiers with one strike."
These are based on the Yetis of the legends, that live in cold places in the Himalayan Mountains. They have a coat of shaggy white fur and are rather violent.
Yetis are dangerous creatures to deal with. They look similar to a [Sasquatch](Sasquatch), the only difference is that Sasquatch has dark brown fur and horns. Their high health makes them practically invulnerable to all but the strongest defenses, and only [Holy%20Order](Paladins) can stave off their attacks for long. Fortunately, they are slow in movement and attack speed and have no resistances to any damage type.
## Overview

These large and dangerous beasts are sometimes found the [Stormcloud%27s%20Winter](Stormcloud's Winter) Adventure.
