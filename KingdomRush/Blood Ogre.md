# Blood Ogre

Blood Ogres are Ogre warlocks wielding the power of [Bloodsydian](Bloodsydian) corruption.
## Overview

"Warlocks that wield the power of the Bloodsydian, spreading corruption through the realm."
Blood Ogres are one of the most dangerous enemies in the Hulking Rage mini-[campaign](campaign). Outside of being quite durable, they have the ability to spread Bloodsydian corruption to their Gnoll underlings, mutating 2-5 [Gnoll%20Reaver](Gnoll Reaver)s and [Gnoll%20Burner](Gnoll Burner)s into the much more formidable and dangerous [Blood%20Gnoll](Blood Gnoll)s (cooldown: 8 seconds / 5 seconds in Impossible mode). This mutation cannot be performed close to the entrance. The Blood Gnolls' relatively high HP for a basic enemy makes - the main counter to large groups - ineffective, which, combined with the low bounty of the Hulking Rage enemies, means that a group of Blood Ogres can easily overwhelm the player's defenses if left unchecked.
