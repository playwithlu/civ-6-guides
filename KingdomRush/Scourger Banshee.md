# Scourger Banshee

Scourger Banshees appear after the death of a [Twilight%20Scourger](Twilight Scourger). They have no encyclopedia entry. They are known as Banshees in the mobile version. 
## Overview

The ghostly remains of a Twilight Scourger seek out nearby to curse, immobilizing them in a final act of revenge for killing their former living selves.
Unlike other enemies, a Scourger Banshee finds and curses nearby towers rather than going directly to the exit. On Steam, possibly due to a bug, Banshees fly along for a second, then eventually curse a random nearby tower. Allowing a Banshee to cross the exit doesn't cost the player any lives, nor does allow them to curse a tower. A cursed tower will be disabled for 10 seconds, during which time it cannot attack or be interacted with. units and [Arch-Druid%20Henge](Runed Bears) can still attack, but will not respawn if they are defeated while the curse is still in effect.
A Scourger Banshee is only spawned following the death of the Twilight Scourger, and will never come from an entrance or spawn point on its own.
