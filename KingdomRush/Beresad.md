Beresad is a black dragon that appears in [Beresad%27s%20Lair](Beresad's Lair), the thirteenth level in .
Description.
Beresad is first seen sleeping at the opening of a cave inside his lair. Behind him is an enormous pile of gold. He cannot be attacked.
Beresad wakes up during the following waves:
Iron Challenge.
Beresad will occasionally open his eyes and puff out smoke, then go back to sleep. During the specified waves however, he will take flight after opening his eyes and fly over one of the four 'lines' of [Strategic%20Point](Strategic Point)s on the map, breathing green fire onto them. He will then return to the entrance of his cave and go back to sleep. Any tower hit by the green fire is disabled for 6 seconds, and towers cannot be built on strategic points that are on fire. 
When Beresad is busy disabling towers, it is possible to steal [Gold](Gold) from his hoard. A maximum of 100 gold can be stolen. Clicking the hoard once will give all 100 gold, however, it is advised to do this as soon as Beresad takes flight because if he comes back it will be interrupted.

 AVARICE
Enemies killed by Beresad generate extra gold. (The description is misleading on mobile.) Specifically, each killed enemy grants two gold more than usual. The effect is as insignificant as it seems; Beresad's real power lies in his other abilities.
