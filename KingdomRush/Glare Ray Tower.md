The Glare Ray Tower is a enemy controlled structure that sits outside the Stormcloud Temple, in the [Legends%20of%20Kingdom%20Rush](Legends of Kingdom Rush) , [Stormcloud%27s%20Winter](Stormcloud's Winter). 
## Overview

The Glare Ray Tower is used by the [Frost%20Harbinger](Frost Harbinger) in the final node of the adventure, where it channels it's powerful energies through [Glare%20Crystal](Glare Crystal)s summoned by the boss. It is the remains of the [Sunray%20Tower](Sunray Tower) that was once used by the Stormcloud Sorcerers, but is now under the control of four [Unblinded%20Priest](Unblinded Priest)s.
Though the Glare Ray Tower has it's own stats and marker on the order of play, it cannot be targeted or attacked in any way.
