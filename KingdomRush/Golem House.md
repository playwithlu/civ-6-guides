# Golem House

Golem House is a special enemy found in , only encountered in [City%20of%20Lozagon](City of Lozagon).
## Overview

"Former structures animated by Magnus Spellbane's magic. Moving to another neighborhood has never been easier."
These houses, before they are awakened, will sit idle at various places on the side of the track, seemingly just part of the scenery. Throughout the level, however, three of these houses will rise from the ground and follow the path to the exit.
Strategy.
One of the three houses is dangerously close to the exit, so the player should have decent stalling power and some towers to kill it, preferably an [Infernal%20Mage](Infernal Mage), [Orc%20Shaman](Orc Shaman), or a [Blazing%20Gem](Blazing Gem). For all the advantages they have in proximity and health, their attack is mediocre and they are susceptible to , which makes them particularly vulnerable to max level [Dark%20Knights](Dark Knights) with Brutal Strike. They can also be possessed by [Specters%20Mausoleum](Specters Mausoleums).
