As we travel through a hot and oppressive cave, we find some cult-related writings carved on a big obsidian stone.
We feel curious about their meaning, but the heat is starting to weigh on us.
Options.
Decipher them.
Requires one of: [Bruxa](Bruxa)
We translate the writings and, after a brief moment, the big stone moves aside!
The rock covered the entrance to a small chamber containing a sturdy chest and many obsidian tools.
We are amazed but also start to feel suffocated...
Break the chest.
Requires a Mighty unit
Open the chest.

Improve your weapons.
Requires a Crafter unit (auto-success)
We decided to invest our time there improving some of our weapons with the high-quality tools.
It took a bit longer than expected, but it was worth it overall.
