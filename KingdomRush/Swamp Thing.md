# Swamp Thing

Swamp Things are giant plant elementals, made of vegetable matter that appear in the [Rotten%20Forest](Rotten Forest) and [Fungal%20Forest](Fungal Forest).
## Overview

"A mass of vegetable matter that comes from the vilest and most tainted of places."
Swamp Things are similar to [Forest%20Troll](Forest Troll)s which have traded a bit of health, power and regeneration for the ability to attack from afar with slime balls. Their ranged attack deals 100 splash damage. Similar to all other ranged enemies, they force the player to do annoying micromanagement with moving rally points, or the soldiers will just sit there and gladly suffocate to death. Their high area damage allows them to quickly clear out anyone less durable than a [Holy%20Order](Paladin); however, the Swamp Thing's (relatively) low durability compared to other giant enemies cannot protect them against a well-organized defense consisting of fully [upgrades](upgraded) towers.
