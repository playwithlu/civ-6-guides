# Sasquatch

&lt;tabber&gt;
Kingdom Rush=
The Sasquatch is a massive beast, long sealed away in a mysterious cave. He only appears in [Icewind%20Pass](Icewind Pass), where he is shown frozen in ice. Whether the player should free him or not is debatable...
Description.
 "The legendary Sasquatch will help you for an offering in food, gold, and sometimes women."
To free this legendary monster, [Rain%20of%20Fire](Rain of Fire) must first be used on the cave to break the ice. Only then can the Sasquatch be purchased.
The Sasquatch looks and acts much like a [Yeti](Yeti) or [Sorcerer%20Mage](Rock Elemental) (he's basically a re-skin of the Yeti). He has a fair amount of hit points and a slow but powerful area attack. His rally point range is almost twice as wide compared to the But his cave is not well-located and two thirds of the range are occupied by rocks and [Strategic%20Point](Strategic Point)s. He regenerates 250 HP for every second when idle.
Unfortunately, the Sasquatch usually is not considered a good investment. He costs 400 [gold](gold) to purchase (500 on Flash), can only block a single enemy, can't be placed far back, which makes him very vulnerable to [Shadow%20Archer](Shadow Archer)s or [Troll%20Champion](Troll Champion)s, and if he dies, he has to be repurchased. It is not recommended to summon him unless you have a formidable defense and extra gold as a few Yetis will kill him.

Description.
While generally peaceful, Sasquatches are territorial and can go to great lengths to stop invaders. If one of them is on our side, we can count on a fierce behemoth in our lines.
Recruiting.
We came across a camper during our travels.
We found that the star get was in fact a huge Sasquatch sitting on a rock. He seemed to be picking some food from between his tusks with a twig.
"I'm done with my second lunch. I need to find something to eat for my third one."
The Sasquatch stood up and grinned at us.
"Ok, we can find some for together. You have my fists!"
