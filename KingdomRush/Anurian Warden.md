# Anurian Warden

Anurian Wardens are ranine enemies. They are encountered in the Anurian Wetlands, the fourth [environment](environment) of , introduced in the Subaquatic Menace [Campaign](Mini-Campaign).
## Overview

"Warriors who trained all their life to protect the mages of the order. Brutal and resilient, they will try to stop any menace no matter the cost".
Hulking frog-men with blue crystals for weapons and armor, Anurian Wardens sport high armor, strong damage and a good amount of health. They also tend to be spawned in relatively large numbers to overwhelm barracks.
Most notably, the blue crystals on their backs can be infused by an [Anurian%20Infuser](Anurian Infuser), providing them a damage shield that allows them to absorb 200 damage. This damage shield can be reapplied quickly, making a Warden and Infuser combo a dangerous threat.
