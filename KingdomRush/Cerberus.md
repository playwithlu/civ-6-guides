## Overview

"Three headed hounds with very thick skin, they can devour scores of soldiers."
Cerberus possess the stats and abilities of a giant enemy without all the flaws of other giant enemies. They are extremely tough, boasting a whopping 6000 health and High physical armor, they can quickly dispatch multiple soldiers at a time with their three mouths. Unlike other giant enemies, they run super fast (only their smaller canine cousins are faster), making [Sorcerer%20Mage](Earth Elemental) even more essential against them. They are also classified as a mini-boss, meaning that they are immune to [Arcane%20Wizard](Death Ray), Teleport, [Sorcerer%20Mage](Polymorph), [Musketeer%20Garrison](Sniper Shot), and [Rangers%20Hideout](Wrath of the Forest). Even though Cerberus usually does not come with minions, they are still one of the most, if not the most, powerful and terrifying enemies in the [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush) series.
