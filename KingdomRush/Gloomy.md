# Gloomy

Gloomies are flying enemies encountered in . They are small, dark grey creatures that appear to be hybrids of faeries and flies. They buzz around the Faery Forest with medium-sized white wings.
## Overview

"Nasty dark faeries that duplicate themselves to form overwhelming forces."
Though individually Gloomies are easy to kill, they have the very annoying power to duplicate themselves. As they usually come in large numbers right from the entrances, they can quickly amass a huge and unmanageable swarm if not taken care of early. Even worse, since Gloomies can fly, the standard counter to large groups - Druids - are highly ineffective against them.
Duplicates of the original one that spawns during a wave do not give any gold when killed, making these enemies very annoying.
