We reach a small pier by the shores of a fast-flowing river. It doesn't take much to understand that crossing it is going to be difficult.
A lonely Sylvan elf sits on the pier, an anchored boat in front of him.
Options.
Ask for passage.
Requires: 25 gold
We asked the elf to take us to the other side of the river.
He did so for a price.
