# Venus Flytrap

The Venus Flytrap is a multi-functioning hazard that appears in the Primal Ravage Mini-Campaign levels: [Lost%20Passage](Lost Passage) and [The%20Original%20World](The Original World). In the former, two appear in normal mode and the heroic challenge, but four are present in the iron challenge. For the latter, two appear in normal mode and the heroic challenge but none are in the iron challenge. The fly trap's first function is to swallow an enemy and spit it out further up on the path. It cannot spit flying enemies, and the enemies that this targets seem to be pre-set. This feature makes [Prehistoric%20Dwarf](Prehistoric Dwarves) a significant threat, as they can be spat from the beginning to the path to the end very quickly. The second function is poison-spitting, which has a long range and spits a projectile which damages a small area over a short period of time. This ability targets the player's troops and reinforcements. While the flytrap appears to be asleep, neither of its abilities are active. If it is awake and its mouth is open, its abilities are active. The Great-T can eat these to regain 2000 health apiece.
