# Skeleton Pile

Skeleton Piles (not to be confused with [Graveyard](Graveyard)s) are special areas that appear in The Curse of Castle Blackburn stages of the Steam, iOS, and Android versions of Kingdom Rush. These areas spawn [Skeleton](Skeleton)s and [Skeleton%20Knight](Skeleton Knight)sÂ sporadically.
Description.
The area is just some scattered bones. [Skeleton](Skeleton)s and [Skeleton%20Knight](Skeleton Knight)s spawn from the terrain of these areas and go towards the 
exit. Their spawning instances occur at fixed times after the start of certain waves.
