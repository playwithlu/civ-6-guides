# Orc

Orcs are the second enemy encountered in [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush).
## Overview

"Tough savages with light armor and medium speed."
Orcs are essentially the players' introduction to physical armor. As such, they are still quite weak, and shouldn't be worried about if the player has at least one or two [Mage%20Tower](Mage Tower)s. Later on, they can be tackled by almost everything, although artillery or mages are still the most efficient options.
