# Ancient Necropolis

"We'll look back fondly on that ambush at [Rotwick](Rotwick), for now the Royal Road brings us to the Necropolis!"
"As our men make their way through ancient crypts and ransacked tombs, they grow restless with the staggering amount of open graves."
"The prenatural silence only makes it worse, as it is undoubtedly but a preamble to another attack by the forces of darkness."
Ancient Necropolis is the twenty-fourth stage in [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush) and the second in the Curse of Castle Blackburn mini-[campaign](campaign) available on the Steam, iOS, and Android versions.
