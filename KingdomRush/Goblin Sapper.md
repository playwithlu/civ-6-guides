# Goblin Sapper

Goblin Sappers, formerly named Goblin Zappers, are [Goblin](Goblin)s armed with grenades, which only appear in the elite stage, [Ruins%20of%20Acaroth](Ruins of Acaroth).
## Overview

"Hardened and fearless [Goblin](goblins) that run into battle tossing bombs at their enemies."
Goblin Sappers are essentially more powerful [Shadow%20Archer](Shadow Archer)s. They throw a bomb that deals physical area damage. Similar to all other ranged enemies, they force the player to do some annoying micromanagement with moving rally points, or the soldiers will sit there and gladly get blasted into pieces. However, just like their mundane counterparts, Goblin Sappers lack durability and can be killed easily.
When a Goblin SapperÂ dies, their backpack full of bombs explodes, dealing 50-150 physical damage in a small radius.
