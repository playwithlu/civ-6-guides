# Magma Elemental

&lt;tabber&gt;Kingdom Rush=
Magma Elementals, called Lava Elementals on the mobile and Steam version, are massive, hulking beasts made of rock and lava. They use devastating area attacks and have more health than any other (main campaign) non-boss enemy in [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush).
## Overview

"Made of rock and fire, magma elementals are beings of death and destruction."
Magma Elementals are functionally similar to the [Yeti](Yeti); tremendously durable enemies that can stave off many attacks and can take out swathes of soldiers with one swing. Soldiers will fall quickly to the ground.
Magma Elementals, being simply giant rocks, are immune to [Rangers%20Hideout](poison).

Strategy.
They are among the most dangerous enemies in this Adventure. They have high health and armor and a strong melee attack. Stunning them takes them out for one turn and is one thing to do against them. Otherwise, all damage and effects are a good strategy.
