# Arcane Wizard

&lt;tabber&gt;Kingdom Rush=
The Arcane Wizard, called Arcane Tower on the iPhone version, is a Level 4 in the original [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush), with a wide range and the highest damage per shot out of any tower. Its spells include Teleport, which teleports a group of enemies back, and Death Ray, which instakills any non-boss enemy regardless of health or resistance.
Compared to the other Level 4 Mage Tower, the [Sorcerer%20Mage](Sorcerer Mage), the Arcane Wizard tends to be better against fewer, tougher enemies, but lacks crowd control, though this is slightly mitigated by Teleport.
Description.
"Arcane wizards focus on altering reality; as well as shooting the deadliest magical ray known to man."
The Arcane Wizard is a true powerhouse. Its high-damage, channeled spell can one-shot most smaller monsters and make short work of other enemies with high HP or armor, be it on the ground or in the air. It also harnesses the power of the deadliest ray known to man: the Death Ray, which can turn any monster to dust in one hit. It is first available at [The%20Citadel](The Citadel).

Recruiting.
We came across a camper during our travels.
The camper turned out to be a wizard. He looked at us as he raised his eyes from his book.
"I sense you are in need of an expert in the arts of arcana. Would you care for my services?"
The wizard stood up and patiently gathered his belongings before joining us.
"You have my... mana?"
