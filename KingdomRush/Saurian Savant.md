# Saurian Savant

Saurian Savants (Savant on the mobile version) are extremely powerful Saurian wizards who can quickly summon an army of Saurians to the battlefield.
## Overview

"Powerful spellcasters, they can summon entire Saurian armies to the battlefield!"
Saurian Savants possess a deadly ranged [True%20Damage](True Damage) attack which can kill fragile heroes like [Nivus](Nivus) or [Ashbite](Ashbite) in mere seconds. However, their most obnoxious ability is to summon entire armies of [Saurian%20Broodguard](Saurian Broodguard)s, [Saurian%20Nightscale](Saurian Nightscale)s and [Saurian%20Darter](Saurian Darter)s to the battlefield, none of which give any bounty when killed. If the Savant summons a Nightscale when halfway through, the Nightscale will probably cloak and waltz past half of the player's defenses. Unlike most other summoning enemies, Saurian Savants must remain stationary to channel their spell and move fairly slowly, allowing their minions to effectively shield them from damage. If left unperturbed, even a single Saurian Savant can easily overwhelm your defenses.
