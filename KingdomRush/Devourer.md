# Devourer

Devourers are dark creatures that feed on soldiers to regain their health.
## Overview

"These servants of [Godieth](Godieth) have an insatiable hunger. They devour everything in its path."
Strategy.
Unlike most other quadrupedal enemies in the Kingdom Rush series, Devourers have physical armor, quite a lot of health, and heal from fallen barracks units (52 HP per heal). Due to their high damage and healing ability, the player should avoid using non-upgraded Barracks against them.
[Wild%20Magus](Wild Magi) work well against them due to their high DPS and instant-killing capability. High Elven Mages are still decent but will struggle against the enemy hordes that Devourers are usually accompanied by.
