# Bloodsydian

Bloodsydian is a red crystal mined by slaves for the Gnoll and Ogre armies of the Howling Moors in . 
Description.
The Bloodsydian stones are much like the [Sorcerer%27s%20Stone](Sorcerer's Stone) found in the First Elven City, however these blood-red gems activate of their own accord and are unstable, applying different effects to passing units. With each activation, they break into multiple pieces which unite after 16 seconds, signalling that they're ready to activate again.
