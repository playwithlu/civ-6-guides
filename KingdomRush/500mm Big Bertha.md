# 500mm Big Bertha

The 500mm Big Bertha is a Level 4 [Dwarven%20Bombard](Dwarven Bombard) in [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush) with high damage and an even larger damage radius. The range is the same as [Dwarven%20Howitzer](Dwarven Howitzer)'s. Its two abilities are the Dragonbreath Launcher, which shoots long-range missiles, and the Cluster Launcher Xtreme, which fires bomblets that explode along the path.
While the [Tesla%20x104](Tesla x104) is good at taking out flying enemies and tanks, the Bertha specializes in killing huge numbers of weak enemies.
Description.
