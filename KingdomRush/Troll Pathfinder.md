# Troll Pathfinder

Troll Pathfinders (Pathfinder on the mobile version) are specialist trolls introduced in the [Glacial%20Heights](Glacial Heights) and [Ha%27Kraj%20Plateau](Ha'Kraj Plateau). They have a unique ability to skate on the [Terrain](Ice)that features on their levels, making them the first non-flying enemy that cannot be normally blocked by .
## Overview

"Elite troll warriors that become unblockable while standing on ice."
Troll Pathfinders have no armor but are a little more powerful than a standard [troll](troll), and have somewhat higher health. Their true strength lies in their ability regenerate HP (7.5 per second, slightly faster than a standard [Troll](Troll)) and their sleds. The levels they feature in have large parts of the path covered in ice. When a Pathfinder reaches the ice, it drops the sleds off its back and skates down it, ignoring any barracks, [reinforcements](reinforcements), [heroes](heroes) or [Sorcerer%20Mage](elementals) that may be in its way. This allows for large amounts of Pathfinders to bypass your main defense at ease.
