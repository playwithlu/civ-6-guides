"With a Dark Army member ([Asra](Asra), [Oloch](Oloch), [Dark%20Knight](Dark Knight)):"
We are approaching an elvish tavern when armed guards surround us before we can put a foot inside the building.
"You must be really naive to think we'll let the likes of you enter this place. Away with you! Or face your punishment right here, right now", says their captain.
Options.
Persuade them.
Requires one of: [Oloch](Oloch), [Knight](Knight)
It took some smart talk to convince the guards to let us enter, but in the end they saw that our mission to save the forest would benefit their people as well, so they put their weapons down.
Archery contest!
Requires: ranged unit
Feeling confident, we challenged the elven archers to an accuracy contest on the shooting range.
We surprised our rivals with a perfect score and they, far from being disheartened, paid up in coins and a round of drinks.
"or"
Feeling confident, we challenged the elven archers practising on the shooting range to an accuracy contest.
We tried our best, but the elves were certainly better than us and we quickly fell behind. We paid the agreed amount and left, silent and ashamed.
Intimidate them.
Requires one of: [Asra](Asra), [Oloch](Oloch)
We reminded them who's still in charge in Linirea, and that if they didn't want to suffer the fury of Vez'nan himself once again, they should really consider getting out of our way.
Groaning, and with their eyes filled with hatred, they let us through.
"Do whatever you need to do, and carry on with your mission. Allies of the Dark Army aren't welcome here", the captain says with a fierce look in his eyes.
"or"
We told them to move or face the Dark Army's might, hoping to instil fear in their minds, but our words fuelled their anger even more instead.
A skirmish started almost immediately, forcing us to flee for our lives.
