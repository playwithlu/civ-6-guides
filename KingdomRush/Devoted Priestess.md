Devoted Priest is an enemy found in , first encountered in [Silveroak%20Outpost](Silveroak Outpost).
## Overview

"They have devoted their lives to do the good will of the order. They use their magic on the battlefield to protect and heal their allies."
Linirean priestesses in white and gold robes, these have weak HP and damage output but emit an aura that gives 50% magic resistance, and heal allies by 15% when their health is below 80%. (Cooldown: 3 seconds). Devoted Priests cannot heal themselves but can heal each other if there are more than one.
They tend to appear often with [Footman](Footmen) and occasionally with [Troop%20Captain](Troop Captain)s, allowing them to enjoy both armor and magic resistance making them tougher to kill while healing them, and their allies in turn draw fire from your towers away from the Priests.
Notably, they give a huge amount of bounty for a rather fragile enemy (45 gold for 250 HP), which gives you more incentive to kill them quickly.
