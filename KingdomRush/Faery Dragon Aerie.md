# Faery Dragon Aerie

The Faery Dragon Aerie is a special tower that only appears in [The%20Crystal%20Lake](The Crystal Lake) stage in . It houses two dragon eggs that can be hatched into Faery Dragons to crystallize enemies.
## Overview

"Dragonlings with a crystallizing punch!"
For a price of 150 gold, a Faery Dragon will hatch from an egg. Faery Dragons cannot be directly controlled but instead patrol a large area around the Aerie. Their attack deals no damage, but crystallizes the target for 1 second*, rendering it completely hapless. Thanks to their decent attack speed, they can greatly hamper big enemies' progress, but since they can't deal damage, they do not work so well against floods of [Sword%20Spider](Sword Spider)s, [Satyr%20Cutthroat](Satyr Cutthroat)s or [Redcap](Redcap)s, and they need to be backed up by other towers that can actually deal damage and kill enemies.
