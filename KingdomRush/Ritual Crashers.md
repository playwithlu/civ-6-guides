"We spot a seemingly empty settlement of cultists and decide to take a better look at it.&lt;br&gt;Once there, we discover more than a dozen cultists inside a big tent, in a deep trance, performing some kind of dark ritual."
Options.
Create a distraction!
First choice brings up a dice challenge, however, the player must have a mage companion or a hero in the crew.
Study them.
The second dice challenge can be unlocked with using focused party members. On success, gain 1 experience orb, but the whole party is cursed. If the dices are unfortune the player will be shown a text and two characters will get Exhausted.
Loot the camp!
"We decided to ignore the ritual and look for valuables around their camp, as they didn't notice our presence."
"Unfortunately, we got carried away and were still around when the ritual ended, so we desperately ran away to avoid being caught."
Keep going.
The fourth choice is a non risk choice. It does nothing and the player can continue in his journey. However it's not recommended to the player as it grants no loot or XP to the player, on the other hand it doesn't hurt or curse the party members.
