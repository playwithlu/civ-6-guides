# Draugr

Draugr are enemies found in , first encountered in [Northerners%27%20Village](Northerners' Village).
## Overview

"Fallen warriors revived by magical forces, risen for their last battle."
Draugrs are weak enemies, barely more dangerous than wildlings, and don't pose a threat in small numbers.
The real threat comes from being summoned by [Valkyrie](Valkyrie)s from dead Northerners, allowing them to spawn directly on choke points, distract towers from attacking the Valkyrie, and allowing her to summon more to overwhelm your defences with stupid Norse zombies. Worst of all, these summoned Draugrs don't grant gold when killed.
Draugrs' magic resistance makes mages almost useless against them, forcing the player to build archers and artilleries, which are less effective against the armored Valkyrie that summons them.
