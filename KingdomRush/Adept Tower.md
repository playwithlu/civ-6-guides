# Adept Tower

The Adept Tower is the Level 2 version of the basic [Mages%20Guild](Mages Guild). Casting enhanced bolts, adepts make short work of armored foes. You can already upgrade your Mage Towers into Adept Towers in Stage 2. The tower is the same in both [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush) and , with only a change in appearance.
Description.
"Adepts cast enhanced bolts, tearing through armor, flesh, and bone."
Having passed the initiation rites, adepts are more capable of conjuring orbs of energy which tear through all physical armor. Although the damage of the Adepts is higher than those of the basic Mage, no specific skills have been developed yet. Like the [Mage%20Tower](Mage Tower), Adepts are also capable of targeting both air and ground units. Adepts can be upgraded into [Wizard%20Tower](Wizards) in stage 3 (Stage 4 in [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush).
Be wary that while most armored troops will quickly fall beneath the magical rampage, some beasts or soldiers of evil are resistant to magical attacks, limiting the effectiveness of the Adept.
