Strategy.
The Deep Devils' Reef is a versatile tower which combines the might of two separate classes; the mage and the barracks. However, it is not the best at filling either of these roles; the mage's damage is not devastating, especially in early tiers, while only two troops are spawned at a time. This consideration makes the Reef poor for situations where one would need overwhelming firepower or opponent stalling.
However, this does not mean that this tower has no use. It is great for a defense-in-depth strategy, where waves of opponents will have to pass through multiple obstructions and will be withered at each. Greenfins can take some damage, comparable to their orc counterparts, and thus can be used to block of enemies while another tower or the Bluegale deals "chipping" damage. Each minor stronghold supported by a Reef might only wither the hordes down by a small margin, but the tower is more affordable than most mages at low tiers and thus can be built in number, making a large number of outposts feasible.
This tower truly shines at tier 4, making it an ideal late-game defense; in some stages it's even viable to rush out a tier 4 reef. The Bluegale is capable of dealing great damage against armored targets at this point, with damage comparable to a high level infernal mage. The Redspines, with their ranged attack and hefty health, can take a beating and return it, but keep in mind that this tower is generally weak against magic resistant enemies. For these reasons, it synergizes well with [Elite%20Harassers](Elite Harassers)- Redspines can keep enemies away from the fragile Harassers, while they supply the physical damage the reefs lack.
