# Fungus Breeder

Fungus Breeders (Breeder on the mobile version) are evil faeries riding giant mushrooms that live in the Faery Forest in .
## Overview

"Masters of mushrooms who wander about, infecting the land with their spores."
Fungus Breeders are relatively squishy enemies with the ability to transform the weak, numerous, volatile [Boomshroom](Boomshroom)s into the bigger, more powerful [Munchshroom](Munchshroom)s. When leaking, they take out 4 [lives](lives), the highest of any enemy in Origins.
Overall Fungus Breeders aren't a big threat. They usually appear very late, many waves into a level, at which point your Druids can blow up groups of Boomshrooms and Munchshrooms alike; and with only 500 HP, it isn't likely that the Fungus Breeder can survive your defenses to leak either. When a Fungus Breeder dies, two (three on Impossible difficulty) Munchshrooms spawn from its corpse. Fortunately they give gold, and the same goes for the Boomshrooms that are spawned from them. Contrary to the game bio, they do not deal explosive damage upon splitting.
