# Malicia

Malicia is one of the three overarching antagonists of the Kingdom Rush franchise. She is one of the two main antagonists of , the queen of the Twilight Elves, and the second boss in the Campaign, encountered in stage 11, [The%20Unseelie%20Court](The Unseelie Court). She and [Mactans](Mactans) are indirectly and partially responsible for [Vez%27nan](Vez'nan)'s rise as the main antagonist of the series.
## Overview

"The evil and deadly Twilight Queen. Three times winner of the Malefic beauty contest."
Malicia sits comfortably on her throne in [the%20Unseelie%20Court](the Unseelie Court). Every few waves, she'll turn into a spark of light, fly forward, then starts to disable towers and spells. When standing here, Malicia is protected by an energy shield that weakens over time: if the shield's HP is depleted, either by itself or by being attacked, she'll immediately fly back to her throne. As the stage progresses, Malicia will leave her throne at an increasingly frequent rate. After wave 15, when her shield is destroyed, Malicia will no longer return to the throne but will fly further forward to the middle magical circle to attack.
After one-third of her HP bar is depleted, Malicia will return to the hallway in front of her throne, then channels her energy shield and starts to disable towers again. She'll continue to attack when her shield is depleted.
When Malicia's HP is reduced to 0, she'll fly back, exhausted, to her throne. Suddenly, she is rescued by the spider queen [Mactans](Mactans), who descends from the sky, wraps Malicia in a web and carries her to the Elven First City.
Malicia and Mactans are encountered again in the [Shrine%20of%20Elynie](Shrine of Elynie), where they work to break the shield around the Tear of Elynie, the artifact that gave birth to the elves themselves.
After wave 15, the shield is broken. Both Malicia and Mactans jump at the Tear screaming 'Mine!', causing the Tear to fuse them into the [Spider%20Goddess](Spider Goddess).
