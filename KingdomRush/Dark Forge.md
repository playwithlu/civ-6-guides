# Dark Forge

The Dark Forge, formerly called the Forbidden Forge,Â is a special tower only available in [Bonesburg](Bonesburg), the nineteenth level in .
Description.
There is a single Dark Forge in the [Campaign](Campaign) and [Heroic%20Challenge](Heroic Challenge) modes and three Dark Forges in the [Iron%20Challenge](Iron Challenge).
The Dark Forge shoots high-voltage electric currents at enemies similar to the [Tesla%20x104](Tesla x104) from the original [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush). Its base damage value is very good, allowing it to deal heavy damage to single targets. However, it attacks very slowly, making it deal with crowds poorly, though this can be rectified somewhat with Lightning Strike. As a matter of fact, 2 Lightning Strike upgrades is all it takes to kill [Bat](Bat)s in one shot on Casual and Normal. In many ways it resembles the [Arcane%20Wizard](Arcane Wizard): powerful single target damage, but generally ill-suited against large hordes. However, where the Arcane Wizard deals magic damage, the Dark Forge deals explosive damage, which ignores half of armor and all of magic resistance.
