Spirit Shamans are magic-resistant savage shamans in the jungle stages . They have an aura that boosts the magic resistance of nearby [Savage%20Warrior](Savage Warrior)s and [Savage%20Hunter](Savage Hunter)s.
## Overview

"Congressing with spirits, they protect their brethren from magic attacks."
Spirit Shamans are almost always seen accompanying [Savage%20Warrior](Savage Warrior)s (and occasionally with an [Earth%20Shaman](Earth Shaman) as well). Their aura boosts the magic resistance of other savages to 80%. Combined with Earth Shamans, they can make other enemies very hard to kill.
