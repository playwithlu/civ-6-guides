# Cavalier

Cavalier is an enemy found in , first encountered in [Lightseeker%20Camp](Lightseeker Camp).
## Overview

"Paladins mounted on fast and strong horses, they can charge over their enemies and reach the backline with ease."
Cavaliers are horse-mounted [Paladin](Paladin)s that can charge past troops at double speed to avoid being blocked. The horse that one's towers will attack has rather low HP and lacks any protection, but will spawn a full-HP Paladin once slain, which can be a problem if they manage to get past most of the player's defenses.
In [Lightseeker%20Camp](Lightseeker Camp), these will be spawned if a Paladin enters the [Saddlery](Saddlery), and will take a shortcut to emerge past half the player's defences.
