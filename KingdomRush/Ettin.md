# Ettin

Ettins are two-headed giants that live in the forest and Gnoll Hills in . Their two heads usually do not get along well with each other, to the point of frequently using their clubs to smack the other head, stunning themselves in the middle of the battlefield.
## Overview

"Two-headed and dim-witted, these vicious giants wield trees as maces."
Ettins are the first giant enemies encountered in Kingdom Rush: Origins. Boasting 900 HP, though again with no armor, along with 85-95 ATK and regeneration, the Ettin is one mean customer. You need archers and mages for the DPS needed to tear through that immense amount of health, or else even with optimized micromanagement to stop other enemies capable of getting in the way of your other towers, you're simply not killing the Ettin, in spite of its slow speed and tendency to stun itself with its club.
The high ATK makes it inefficient to stagger the Ettin, who can smash through barracks very quickly. The Ettin's intent is to make sure that you are able to work without relying too much on druids or [Thunderbolt](Thunderbolt), which simply do not do much against it due to all that HP.
One should make sure to take note of their giant HP buff on Impossible difficulty, and plan accordingly.
Strategy.
Use High-Level strong melee heroes like [Eridan](Eridan), [Bravebark](Bravebark), [Prince%20Denas](Prince Denas), [Xin](Xin) or [Bruce](Bruce) to slow them down. Do not use barracks against them, their superior damage is enough to clear a whole trio of Defenders or Wardens within moments. [Arcane%20Archers](Arcane Archer's) Sleeping Arrow could slow them down while [Wild%20Magus](Wild Magus) Eldrich Doom could instant kill them. Awok Warriors will waste you a ton of gold if you send them against Ettins.
Try not to use [Thunderbolt](Thunderbolt) when killing Ettin, unless they are in a group of two or more. Instead, use soldiers to slow them down for better deal.
