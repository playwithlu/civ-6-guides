# Mogwai

Mogwai are enemies found in the Oriental Plains, the sixth environment of , introduced in the Rise of the Dragon Mini-Campaign.
## Overview

"Small beings on uncontrolled energy, frantically attack their enemies and destroy everything that has any value."
For an enemy almost as frail as a Dwarf Bruiser and low damage, Mogwai may seem equally unthreatening compared to recruits or other tougher enemies. However, when they make contact with water, they will start multiplying themselves which can easely overwhelm a defense even with high dps towers.
In later stages and waves, they come in huge numbers, sometimes accompanied by the Arcane Magi, making artillery essential to stop them.
Strategy.
There are two ways to handle these enemies.
Avoid them having contact with water. Make sure to use high level towers like Boneflingers or Mausoleums to block these enemies. They are very frail and can easely be beaten by most high level units. Shaolin Temple is tailor-made for them as it not only stuns them with every attack, but can also handle groups of 3. Upgrades allow the temple to send more monks out for even bigger groups of mogwai.
Area of Effect
Artillery proves to be an excellent option as not only can they handle groups of them even when multiplying. Zeppelin and Rocket riders at level 4 will one shot them regardless of difficulty at their regular attack; the Melting Furnace can handle groups, especially with burning fuel upgraded and Rotten forest can easely delay with Evil Treants and Roots of Evil can block/disable them while inflicting damage over time. Swamp Things in Melee mode is also a solid option, a level 3-4 can one shot them, however keep in mind that the Swamp Thing is a very slow at engaging all them so some may leak.
While ineffective at handling groups of them, the Spectral Mausoleum can be very effective if it uses Possession on either a High Sorcerer or Arcane Magus as they sometimes appear with Mogwai, the latter often appear commonly with them while the other can one shot them with a single attack.
Just as with sheep in [City%20of%20Lozagon](City of Lozagon)'s Iron Challenge, it is possible to rely on Soul Impact to kill large scores of them and thus have the ability cool down almost instantly. In this case, it may actually be beneficial to let them cross a river at least once to get more kills and cool down the ability more reliably.
