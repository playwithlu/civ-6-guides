Ogre Magi are powerful two-headed Ogres with strong magical abilities.
## Overview

"These spell casting Ogres have the power to absorb damage from nearby enemies."
Ogre Magi are powerful, blue, two-headed magical ogres found in the Hulking Rage mini-[campaign](campaign). They have the unique ability of absorbing 50% damage from their nearby allies, and have a strong physical ranged attack, along with high magical resistance and quick regeneration. Unlike the average [Ettin](Ettin)s, the two heads of an Ogre Magi get along quite well together and are smart enough to not smack themselves with their own club - thus, they do not stop periodically.
