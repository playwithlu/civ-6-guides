# Shroom Game

The Shroom Game is a minigame hosted by a gnome in [Neverwonder](Neverwonder).
Description.
In Shroom Game, there is a set of four mushrooms with different color. Each makes a bell-like sound with a particular pitch: the green E-flat 5, the yellow G 5, the red B-flat 5, and the blue C 6. (When combined, they form a C minor seventh chord.)
When tapped on, the gnome activates the mushrooms, which will glow in a random order. When they're done glowing, the player has to tap the mushrooms in the order that they glowed.
The first time the game is played, the mushrooms will glow a total of four times. If the player successfully reproduces the pattern, the gnome will award 25 [gold](gold). Each round, the gnome adds one to the previous pattern and the reward is increased by 15 gold. 
If the player fails, the mushroom quartet glows red and makes a discordant sound. Then the game is reset and the next game begins with a new pattern.
In addition, the player CANNOT play the game before the first wave or when the battle is paused. That means that the player will have to memorize the order while managing his or her towers and spells to defend against enemies.
On the bright side, there is no limit in either reward or time, so players can theoretically play the Shroom Game infinitely many times and, if they are quick enough, use the gold earned to build their dream setup on the level.
