# Dragon's Power

"" Those foolish priests did the worst thing that they could... they meddled with an ancient relic from a long forgotten civilization and summoned a [Dragon%20King](powerful dragon) [Mogwai](and) [Nian](its) [Carnival%20Dragon](minions). Surely they think they can control him... Fools! They're the ones that will be controlled, they and us all! Stop him at any cost before he can regain his full strength, General!""
