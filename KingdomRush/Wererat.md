# Wererat

Wererats are stronger versions of [Giant%20Rat](Giant Rat)s that appear in the Curse of Castle Blackburn mini-[campaign](campaign)Â in the Steam, iOS, and Android versions of [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush).
## Overview

"Driven by hunger and hate, these vile creatures revel in rot and decay."
Wererats have low armor and quite a bit of health, but their main advantage is the ability to tear through barracks, and even Elementals with ease thanks to their disease spreading and their speed, even faster than [Giant%20Rat](Giant Rat)s. They also usually spawn in groups, so and particularly Teslas are very effective against them.
The disease is even more potent than that of Giant Rats, dealing 135 [True%20Damage](True Damage) over 2 seconds. Just like it, it halves the damage of the affected soldiers, and [Sorcerer%20Mage](Earth Elementals).
