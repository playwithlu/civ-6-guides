 Dodge : 25% chance to Dodge targeted melee attacks. 
 Sylvan Awareness : This unit is immune to the [Status%20Effects%23asleep](Asleep) status.
Strategy.
Unique among most bipedal enemies is their dodge chance, so it is highly preferable to kill them from afar. They also deal massive damage to armor, so if they get too close, only high health will stack up against them.
