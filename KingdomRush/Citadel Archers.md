# Citadel Archers

Citadel archers are the first line of defense at King Denas's castle.
## Overview

The six Citadel Archers are positioned on the ramparts, shooting at the player's barrack soldiers, hero and reinforcements, dealing only 3-4 damage per shot each. They cannot be damaged or otherwise interacted with. [Vez%27nan](Vez'nan) will use his power to destroy the ramparts after wave 8, killing the archers in the process. Although it may seem like Citadel Archers themselves have a short range, they can actually target units regardless of where they are in the entire stage, which makes it impossible for allies to stay out of range.
