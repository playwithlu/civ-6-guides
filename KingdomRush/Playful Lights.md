# Playful Lights

Playful Lights is a mystery node in the game [Legends%20of%20Kingdom%20Rush](Legends of Kingdom Rush) in the map [The%20Wild%20Moon](The Wild Moon) identified by a green tree.
In the dark of the night, we are surprised by glowing wisps flying around, as if they're trying to get us to follow them.
Their intentions are not really clear.

Follow the wisps.
We followed the wisps for hours until they disappeared inside a cave behind a fallen tree, which we managed to move aside.
The thought of walking back to our path overshadowed any joy we felt for the goods we found inside.
