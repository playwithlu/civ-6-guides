&lt;tabber&gt;Kingdom Rush=
Lycans are more powerful versions of [Werewolf](Werewolves), encountered in the Shadowmoon mini-campaign in and the Curse of Castle Blackburn campaign of [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush).
## Overview

"Powerful warriors that shift into terrible beasts."
Lycans often enter the map as relatively weak humans, with little health and damage. However, upon reaching 25% of the health, they transform into big, vicious werewolves with high attack, fast movement speed, a magic resistance buff from Low to Medium and very fast regeneration, able to blaze through low-level with ease. In their werewolf form, Lycans will occasionally transform the player's troops into [Werewolf](Werewolves).
In later waves of the Blackburn levels, some Lycans will begin already in their werewolf form, hence why the wave compositions list their names twice.

Lycans become especially dangerous when the [Moon](Moon) is full: it transforms all Lycans currently in human form into wolf form, while giving them a 200% boost to regeneration.
Lycans are one of the most dangerous enemies in the Shadowmoon mini-campaign, and should be killed quickly with lots of physical damage or an instant kill.
