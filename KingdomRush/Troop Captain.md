Bulky looking Linirea army captains in strong armor, they are in charge of promoting the [Recruit](Recruit)s into [Footman](Footmen). They have a good bit of health, damage and armor and shout to promote and transform nearby Recruits to Footmen every 6 seconds if not blocked. The Footmen will not be healed to full, but they will gain 70 extra HP (since they have 70 more HP than Recruits), and their bounty will still remain at 16 gold like the Recruits, which makes the ability purely detrimental to the player.
