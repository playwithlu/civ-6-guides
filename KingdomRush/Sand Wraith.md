# Sand Wraith

Sand Wraiths are powerful desert ghost wizards who possess a ranged attack, can summon [Fallen](Fallen) and heal other enemies.
## Overview

"Often in command of dark armies, they leave a path of death and decay in their wake."
Sand Wraiths are very similar to [Necromancer](Necromancer)s from the original [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush): rare but very durable enemies. Not only do they have a solid amount of hit points and a ranged attack that can eliminate and reinforcements, additionally they have the ability to spawn a swarm of disposable meat shields. Unlike the Necromancers, however, Sand Wraiths do not raise undead next to them, but from a sarcophagus that they summon a distance in front of them, which allows these [Fallen](Fallen) to bypass part of the player's defenses. The sarcophagus cannot be destroyed, but crumbles after summoning four Fallen. If they are not taken quickly they are capable of creating their own army numerous enough to take the attention of your towers and distract them, allowing more important enemies to pass almost without taking any amount of damage.
Sand Wraiths also possess the ability to heal 100 health to nearby allies every 8 seconds, but this healing is rather inefficient.
