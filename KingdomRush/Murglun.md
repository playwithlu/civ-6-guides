Description.
"Inhabiting the bowels of the Earth, the" 
"millennial Murglun ele"
"young members of the imposing race of magma dragons. She has inscrutable motivations and was never interested in the mortal conflicts, until Vez'nan managed to manipulate her with the gem of the heart of a volcano."
Magma Dragons never had an interest in mortal conflicts, the petty humans and their affairs were insignificant, their mortal lives shorter than a sigh and mostly spent on foolish conflicts.
Murglun, even at her young age, knew this; she lived with her kin in the bowels of the earth, where the lava rivers kept her warm and the conflicts and power struggles of the surface were meaningless.
From the moment Vez'nan knew these creatures existed, he knew he needed them to tilt the fate of the battle to his side. He forged a plan to control them, he knew these creatures were mystically connected to the volcano heart gems, and searched far and wide until he got a hold of one.
Now Murglun has to obey his command and use her fire powers to scorch the heart of his foes until this battle is won and she can return to her lair.

Tips and Tricks.
Murglun has arguably the highest damage output of all the heroes in the game, dealing large amounts of true area damage, in addition to buffing the damage of nearby towers. Her lava blood ability allows her to damage enemies right underneath her, something flying heroes normally cannot do. Keep in mind however, that while her damage output is excellent, unlike [Beresad](Beresad) and [Eiskalt](Eiskalt) she has no crowd control whatsoever.
Murglun's ultimate ability is a powerful tool to immediately insta-kill troublesome enemies, especially if they are clomped together. It takes a second for the rocks to fall, so if the targeted enemy is moving it may be necessary to lead the ability just a smidge. If the enemies are spead out, group them together with demons.
Being a flying hero, Murglun Cannot be used to block enemies.
