# Barbarian Mead Hall

The Barbarian Mead Hall, or just Barbarian Hall, is a Level 4 . It trains the mighty barbarians: ruthless hunters who hack through their foes with axes, axes, and more axes! They are capable of throwing these heavy weapons, and also wield nets that slow flying enemies.
These barbarians will tear your enemies to shreds! Many fear their blood-thirsty and war-hungry attitude, but it's a good thing they're on your side...for now.
They regenerate 20 HP per second when idle.
Description.
"Barbarians are savage warriors that will quickly clear a battlefield, usually at the cost of their own lives."
Barbarians are deadly but versatile troops. They are able to wield not one, but "two" double-bladed axes in battle (when upgraded), dealing insane amounts of damage to enemies. Throwing Axes and Hunting Nets allow them to tackle small amounts of flying enemies. In the Mobile and Steam versions, instead of Hunting Nets, Barbarians have the ability to do a Whirlwind Attack, dealing area damage within a certain radius.
Compared to the Paladins of the [Holy%20Order](Holy Order), Barbarians are less durable, despite their greater HP, as they have no armor or healing abilities. However, they deal far more damage, and are able to attack from a distance and engage flying enemies.
Abilities.
Throwing Axes.
 "It's raining axes!" 
Barbarians can throw great axes at ground and flying enemies in range. Cooldown: 3.5 seconds
Hunting Nets.
 "Stay Put!"
Hunters by nature, Barbarians can throw nets to slow flying enemies for a while. "(Flash only)"
This ability disables [Rocket%20Rider](Rocket Rider)s' turbo.
Whirlwind Attack.
 "I got something to axe you.." 
When Barbarians execute their melee attack, they have a chance for their attack to become an area attack dealing a different amount of damage as physical damage. The description incorrectly states that the chance runs when they are struck, but it actually runs when they strike with their own attacks. ("Mobile and Steam only")
More Axes.
 "Double the Axes. Double the fun!" 
Barbarians equip an additional axe to deliver additional damage. On iOS, their attack speed is slowed down by 0.3 seconds after this upgrade. When fully upgraded, they can deal up to 54 damage.
