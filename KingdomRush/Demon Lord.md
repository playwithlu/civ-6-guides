# Demon Lord

&lt;tabber&gt;Kingdom Rush=
Demon Lords are resistant to magic and can cast damage-absorbing shields on other demons. They also explode and deal damage to nearby soldiers on death.
Appearance.
Demon Lords are red, demonic creatures. They have a pair of horns on the top of their head, and they have two narrow slits as eyes. Demon Lords have a frown with two downturned fangs. They wear golden armbands and a golden belt. Demon Lords also have some sort of golden pendant around their neck and they wear brown pants.
## Overview

"They lead their fiendish armies into battle, protecting their minions with infernal shields."
Demon Lords obviously fight supported by large numbers of other demonic enemies. Around every 7 seconds, Demon Lords will cast a spell that provides a shield only for [Demon%20Spawn](Demon Spawn)s,Â [Demon%20Hound](Demon Hound)s, [Flareon](Flareon)s, [Demon%20Legion](Demon Legion)s, [Gulaemon](Gulaemon)s, and [Cerberus](Cerberus) around them.
Each shield negates 4 damage instances before it breaks. It also nullifies any damage [Afflictions](affliction) (such as poison from [Rangers%20Hideout](Rangers Hideouts), the passive curse from [Sorcerer%20Mage](Sorcerer Mages), and the Slow Curse from all magic towers). Afflictions applied before the shield will still take effect. When Demon Lords recast the spell, the damage-negating instance of all existing shields are recharged as well.
## Overview

These strong units command the battlefield with their array of abilities and are found in the later nodes of the [Extradimensional%20Menace](Extradimensional Menace).
