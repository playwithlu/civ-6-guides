Description.
"A bit more eccentric than wise, he wrote most spells taught today in the Wizard’s Academy. Nivus wields an astounding power… and with such power comes great responsibility."
Teacher of many, master of none, his magic as unfathomable and unpredictable as his ramblings. He wields great arcane powers with unexpected good judgement as he is fully aware that with great powers comes great lawsuits.
Mess with a wizard and you'll know true regret, but mess with an Archmage and everyone will.
