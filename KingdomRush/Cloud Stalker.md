# Cloud Stalker

Cloud Stalkers are flying ray-like creatures that reside in the ruins of the elven First City in . They serve as the primary flying enemy in the final stages of the game.
## Overview

“"Flying magical creatures, they lay eggs in their victims to spawn their offspring.”"
Cloud Stalkers are one of the most annoying enemies in the entire game: instead of ignoring soldiers like other flying enemies, they'll descend down to attack. Their 'attack' renders a soldier useless and two Cloud Stalkers spawn from the corpse if the host dies from their attack. This pretty much kills your [Defender%20Barracks](barracks) defenses as a face hugged soldier isn't considered dead yet and thus will not respawn.
