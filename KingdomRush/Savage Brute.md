# Savage Brute

Savage Brutes are special only appearing in [Ma%27qwa%20Urqu](Ma'qwa Urqu). They have no encyclopedia entry.
## Overview

In [Campaign](Campaign) mode, a Savage Brute spawns on waves 5, 7, 10, 13 and 14. On Steam and Android, it spawns 52 seconds after the beginning of wave 3. 
A Savage Brute always spawns in the westernmost hut in the village, carrying a damsel whom he intends to feed to the [volcano](volcano). He will then proceed to the volcano, occasionally taking brief breaks. When he reaches the crater, he will throw the damsel into the lava: the sacrifice somehow awakens the volcano, which will fire several big fireballs at the player's soldiers, dealing 100 area damage (20-30 area damage on Flash)
