Description.
Tales say he was a close friend of the goddess Elynie, others claim that the Draco constellation lost a star the night he was born. Legends go far beyond that saying that he is the eternal protector of the elves, meant to watch out for them until the end of times. Whichever the truth is, Faustus has unlocked almost all the secrets of draconian sorcery, one still remains a mystery.
Lore.
When the elves were created, the Goddess Elynie chose Faustus to protect and watch over them until the end of times, and thus she linked his soul to her most cherished treasure: the Tear of Elynie.
Faustus watched over the elves while their civilization strived and bloomed. He was there to bless the little [Alleria%20Swiftwind](Princess Alleria) when she took her first breath. The elves, in return, respected and loved him and it was every elven wizard's dream to learn the advanced incantation techniques from him.
He remained devoted to this task until the fateful day the dreadful [Spider%20Goddess](Spider Goddess) corrupted the crystal's essence and in the process, Faustus`s soul. Tainted by the dark forces, he gradually abandoned the draconian sorcery and turned into the dark magic arts, a powerful force that consumed his flesh, leaving only his bones behind. Nothing remained of the former elven protector, not even his name, as he was now known as [Bonehart](Bonehart).

Tips and Tricks.
Faustus is a flying hero that excels at lane harassing and crowd control on a large lane area. His skillset specializes in disrupting groups of enemies and weakening their advances, with tools such as teleporting foes back, disabling abilities from enemies, and igniting a large area of a path for weakening tough foes and killing off weaker foes. While Faustus is able to sweep swarms of weaker foes easily with his abilities alone, positioning and micromanagement of his abilities is essential to assure any area control abilities are being tactically used, as Faustus is unable to kill off a strong and beefy foe easily on his own. Overall, Faustus serves as a [True%20Damage](true damage) area sweeper that is able to carpet-bomb wide stretches of area to disrupt and scorch advancing foes.
Despite Faustus dealing [True%20Damage](true damage) via both his attacks and all of his abilities, Faustus' regular attacks are split into 3 projectiles that deal a third of the listed damage. This means that Faustus is able to deal damage to multiple enemies at once. This serves as a double-edged sword, as Faustus is unable to deal massive damage against an important target unless said foe was isolated. 
Faustus has a significantly fast travel speed, allowing him to travel to another area in need quickly. Due to Faustus not being able to easily kill foes as effectively compared to other flying heroes, players are recommended to adopt an attack and defend playstyle with Faustus to make use of his abilities, travel speed, and attacks.
