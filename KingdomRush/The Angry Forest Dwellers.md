As we make our way through, we are stopped in our tracks by a considerable number of forest-dwellers barricaded behind a fallen tree.
"No step further, stranger," calls a gnome, armed with the rusted remains of a spear. "We've got enough problems thanks to the Coven, so skedaddle!"
Options.
Convince them to let you through.
Requires one of: [Sorceress](Sorceress), [Oloch](Oloch)
We explained our intentions to the forest-dwellers, and they agreed to let us through.
"If you are to right the Coven's wrongs, then you have our blessing, outsider. But be aware, the forest has many eyes and ears," said the gnome.
Force them to let you through.
We had no time to lose, so we tried to coerce the forest-dwellers to let us through.
They didn't take that kindly, and it all ended in a scuffle.
We got away with it in the end, at the expense of some bruises and an unflattering curse, courtesy of their leader.
