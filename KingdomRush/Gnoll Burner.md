# Gnoll Burner

Gnoll Burners are gnolls wielding torches that they throw at soldiers. They are the second enemy encountered in and the player's introduction to ranged attacks.
## Overview

"Malicious beasts that delight in setting forests and creatures on fire."
Gnoll Burners pose a threat in early levels, as their attacks burn your troops, dealing [True%20Damage](True Damage) over 2 seconds. However, their damage is not impressive compared to that of the [Twilight%20Harasser](Twilight Harasser) and [Gnoll%20Blighter](Gnoll Blighter), and their low HP and lack of resistances make them easy targets for your towers.
In Impossible difficulty, Gnoll Burners gain a substantial amount of melee damage, giving them more of an edge over your unupgraded soldiers and reinforcements.
In the Hulking Rage mini-campaign, they can be crystallized by [Bloodsydian](Bloodsydian) crystals or [Blood%20Ogre](Blood Ogre)s into the faster, more powerful [Blood%20Gnoll](Blood Gnoll)s.
In two levels, [Redwood%20Stand](Redwood Stand) and [Galadrian%27s%20Wall](Galadrian's Wall), Gnoll Burners are seen torching forests, burning them down to open new paths, even destroying a [Bastion](Bastion) and an archer garrison in the latter level.
Gnoll Burners do not use their ranged attack on [Vez%27nan](Vez'nan)'s Demon, as the demon is made of fire and immune to burning. 
Strategy.
Ranged enemies such as the Gnoll Burner are less dangerous in "Origins" than they are in the past games because soldiers and reinforcements now have a ranged attack, but are still powerful in groups. Regardless, an advanced player shall wise to leave Hunters, Mystics, and Circles to deal with them lest they clear the way for frailer enemies.
