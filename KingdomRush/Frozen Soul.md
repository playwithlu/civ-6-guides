## Overview

"An ice elemental, normally embedded inside it's shell of ice and rock, now free to roam"
Frozen Soul appears after the death of [Frozen%20Heart](Frozen Heart). If it is not killed in 8 seconds, [Frozen%20Heart](Frozen Heart) rises from its soul and the life cycles again until its soul has been killed. The resurrection does not occur when it's within 60 nodes from the exit.
Frozen Souls also appear inÂ the [Iron%20Challenge](Iron Challenge) of [Breaking%20the%20Ice](Breaking the Ice). Unlike its counterpart of the soul from a [Frozen%20Heart](Frozen Heart), they are spawned directly from entrances. They have a bit of different appearance, higher health, 100% armor, and grant less bounty when killed. Though its quality seems higher, it is typically less dangerous than the one from [Frozen%20Heart](Frozen Heart), as they do not reform into a Frozen Heart, and remain a soul forever.
