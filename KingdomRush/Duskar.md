# Duskar

"The nomad tribes do not take kindly to trespassers, so don't provoke the desert's fiercest denizens, the Duskar!"
Two Duskar warriors: a sniper and his spotter, supervise the battle at the [Sape%20Oasis](Sape Oasis). They stand far enough to be away from the heat of the battle but within firing range.
Duskar will only start targeting if enemies and friends are fighting together.
The Duskar sniper is armed with a sniper rifle that deals 100-200 physical damage. More often than not, his target is an enemy, but sometimes a or the player's [Hero](Hero) might become a victim as well.
