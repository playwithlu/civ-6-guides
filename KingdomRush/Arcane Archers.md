Strategy.
Arcane Archer specializes in Crowd Control, wreaking havoc in groups of weak enemies with Burst Arrows, which deals magic damage and catch leaks effectively with Slumber Arrows. Their most notable asset is the ability to shoot at up to two targets in range simultaneously, dealing damage while reducing the magic resistance of those enemies. Arcane Archers should be placed in front, near lines of , so they can thin out the coming horde with their skills, leaving stronger foes for the Mages to kill. This also allows the Arcane Archers' ability to reduce magic resistance to synergize with Mages.

Conclusion.
Arcane archers are very useful with the ability to weaken magic resistance and have the ability to do group damage with Burst Arrows, with stalling power in Slumber Arrows. They don't do as much damage as the Golden Longbow, instead they are more focused on utility and crowd control with decent damage and fire rate, shooting two arrows at one time. They don't have the extreme range of the Longbow either, but they make up for this in utility. This however does mean that if there is more than one enemy in their range they will have a hard time killing strong enemies, because they will not fire both arrows at the same target if more than one is in range. Thusly, they are liable to getting overrun on waves where there are hordes of high health enemies (the most they can do is use Burst Arrows which only do 264 damage, not enough to kill strong enemies that show up in hordes on later stages such as Twilight Scourgers), and while the golden longbow can also get overrun, it fares much better with it's range and increased attack speed to enemies close to it. Overall the Arcane Archers are useful in situations with heavy magic resisting enemies while doing mixed damage with their Burst Arrows and stalling enemies with Slumber Arrows, working better as a tower towards the entrances of a level so they can diminish enemy magic resistance and weaken enemies so that mages and other towers can finish off the weakened enemies.
