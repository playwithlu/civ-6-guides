Bluegales have a solid ranged attack, and an ability to call storms, damage over time to soldiers, healing themselves and their allies, obscuring vision and preventing the player from selecting, upgrading towers and moving rally points. They are also the only non-boss enemy in the series with complete magic immunity, forcing one to use or , which are useless against the [Bloodshell](Bloodshell)s. Their slow speed compared to [Greenfin](Greenfin)s and [Deviltide](Deviltide)s allows them to be shielded from damage much like [Saurian%20Savant](Saurian Savant)s, giving them free reign to nuke one's soldiers and towers: [Necromancer%20Tower](Skeletons) are hit particularly hard due to their high numbers and low health, making them vulnerable to area attacks.
