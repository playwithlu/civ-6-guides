# Shadow Archer

&lt;tabber&gt;
Shadow Archers are strong enemies that can attack soldiers from a distance using bows.
Description.
"Deadly accurate archers that will shoot at nearby soldiers in their path."
Cautious generals should be aware of the approach of a group of Shadow Archers. They are mostly just annoying, but can also be potentially dangerous. Their strong bows can quickly turn soldiers and reinforcements into mincemeat, opening the way for other enemies to march through. The [Dark%20Knight](Dark Knight)s they usually travel with are countered by magic towers, but the archers themselves contain a low level of magic resistance, allowing them to stay alive a little longer, but upgraded mages still make short work of them.
