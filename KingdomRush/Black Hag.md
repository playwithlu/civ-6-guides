# Black Hag

Black Hags are broom-riding flying witches encountered in the Curse of Castle Blackburn mini-[campaign](campaign) in the Steam, iOS, and Android versions of [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush).
## Overview

"These eerie black robed women fly on their brooms casting wicked spells."
Black Hags are [Lord%20Blackburn](Lord Blackburn's) flying support units that come in groups in later waves and do not follow the visible road; instead, they mostly fly along a curvy, invisible path in the air to the exit. They possess a very long ranged attack, but instead of staying in one place to attack until there are no more soldiers in sight, they stop and use a Toad's Curse spell once and then progress forward until either they fly along their own invisible path all the way to the exit or for 2 seconds after which they will attack again if at least one soldier is nearby when they stop again. Their spell turns soldiers and even [Earth%20Elemental](Earth Elemental)s into harmless frogs, essentially killing them instantly as they promptly disappear; like all other non-boss [instant%20kill](instant kill)s, it does not work on [hero](hero)es, but only deals damage to them.
Strategy.
Black Hags are extremely dangerous enemies, mainly because they don't follow the pre-made path, but have a rather garbled invisible path of their own, entering and leaving towers' range constantly, so if not taken attention they can be a very big hazard for your defenses. Their arrival is now announced by a high cackle for each hag that enters the field.
