# Jack O'Lantern

&lt;tabber&gt;Kingdom Rush: Frontiers=
Jack O'Lantern is a pumpkin-headed dark horseman who appears only in [Desecrated%20Grove](Desecrated Grove). In the update description, he is also known as the Headless Horseman. He does not have an encyclopedia entry.
## Overview

Jack O'Lantern appears at a random point on the path, announcing his presence with an evil laugh. He will then summon some [Zombie](Zombie)s and/or [Ghoul](Ghoul)s, then either quickly disappear or continue to summon until killed. In the [Heroic%20Challenge](Heroic challenge), Jack has been observed summoning [Ghost](Ghost)s. Jack will not proceed down the path, but the summoned minions will. He can also remove his head and throw it for a ranged attack, dealing area damage. 
Because Jack O'Lantern always summons an entourage when he appears, it is often not easy to isolate and kill him before he disappears unless the player is using a fast melee-capable hero like [Dante](Dante) or [Kutsao](Kutsao). However, he should always be killed if possible because of his enormous bounty (200), and because he might linger up to four or five times during a full Moon, making him a very profitable (if a bit unreliable) source of [gold](gold).

Tips and Tricks.
Jack plays the role of a 
He does all three things kind of okay, but isn't wonderful at anything. His Nightmare skill, however the panic (enemy units travel in reverse for the duration of the skill) is woefully ineffective on slower-moving units. He's squishy, so keeping him behind melee units is a must. 
His melee attack is slow and does a surprisingly low amount of damage, so relying on his area damage skill is the way to go.
