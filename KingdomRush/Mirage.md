Tips and Tricks.
Mirage is a ranged physical hero adept in harassing and rewards hit-and-run playstyles when micromanaged well.
Guide to masterfully micromanage Mirage:
Unlike the other three free heroes, Mirage's potentials must be exploited through micromanaging her, since she is not as tacky nor as reliable as a blocker and is much more useful at range than in melee. Although the specifics may differ from player to player, there are a couple of useful tips and tricks to use Mirage effectively:
A note on Precision: It only affects the range of her normal attack, excluding Shadow Dance and Lethal Strike. And because she is the only ranged hero who doesn't heal when ranged-attacking, it is advised to upgrade it last.
