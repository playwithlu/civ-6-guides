# Stormcloud Temple

""Arriving at the Stormcloud temple has been the best thing to happen to us in days!"
"The [Sorcerer%20Mage](Stormcloud Sorcerers) will now be at your command, General, and they can open a portal straight to [The%20Wastes](Valardul). However, we must provide them with a defense while they complete their spell."
"Something... [J.T.](abominable) is approaching, and the men are extremely nervous.""
Stormcloud Temple is the ninth level in [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush) comprised of nineteen waves. There are three points of entry: two to the north and the south, leading enemies along curved paths, and one to the east leading a straight route to the temple.
The second advanced magic tower, the [Sorcerer%20Mage](Sorcerer Mage), is unlocked on this stage. Additionally, this is the only scenario to feature the [Sunray%20Tower](Sunray Tower), a unique tower that fires a powerful beam at a single enemy of the player's choice.
