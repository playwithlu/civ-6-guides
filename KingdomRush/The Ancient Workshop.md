Inside a nearby cave, we discover what looks like an abandoned forge or workshop from times immemorial.
Unfortunately, the only way to reach it seems to be by hopping across the top of a series of narrow pillars that lead to the centre of the cave.
Options.
Jump across the pillars.
Requires: Athletic unit
We nimbly hop from pillar to pillar until we reach the workshop.
There are many abandoned goods scattered around!
"or"
We made a rough misstep on the first pillar, making it fall forward and forcing us to jump back as the pillars fell, one by one, in a domino effect.
After collecting ourselves, we resumed our journey.
Fix the crane.
Requires: Crafter unit
Using the tools we found around us, we successfully repaired the crane and moved the big rock.
Behind it was a small chamber containing valuables! We took what we could and got out of the cave.
Break it apart.
