# The Sulphuric Breach

The Sulphuric Breach is a dice challenge in the game [Legends%20of%20Kingdom%20Rush](Legends of Kingdom Rush) in the map [Extradimensional%20Menace](Extradimensional Menace).
Walking along a crag, we notice the acrid smell of sulphuric fumes coming out of a narrow cave in the rocks.
We are just about to get away from it when we notice there's a stash of goods inside.

We crafted a mask for one of us to enter the cave, but it didn't filter the fumes well enough, and they ended up getting poisoned shortly after entering the cave.
