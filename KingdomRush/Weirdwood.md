# Weirdwood

The Weirdwood is a level 4 Artillery Tower in , unlocked in stage 10, [Neverwonder](Neverwonder). It is a huge Treant that throws equally huge acorns at enemies.
Description.
"This huge Treant is of the very angry kind! It gives a whole new meaning to 'wrath of the forest'!"
Compared to the other level 4 Druid Tower, the [Arch-Druid%20Henge](Arch-Druid Henge), the Weirdwood's nuts are stronger, and both of its abilities can clear masses of weak enemies extremely quickly. However, the Weirdwood attacks slower, can't block enemies, can't store more than one nut when idle like the Arch-Druid can, and subsequently lacks crowd control. They are better placed near the frontlines where they can effectively wreck the likes of [Redcap](Redcap)s, [Boomshroom](Boomshroom)s or [Spiderbrood](Spiderbrood)s so the towers at the back can focus more on the bigger, stronger enemies.
