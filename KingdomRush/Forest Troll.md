# Forest Troll

Forest Trolls are massive, hulking beasts, cousins to the [Troll](Troll)s of the [Ha%27Kraj%20Plateau](Ha'Kraj Plateau). Their fast regeneration rate and high health make them one of the most feared enemies in [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush).
## Overview

"The biggest and hardest to kill troll species, these behemoths can regenerate their wounds almost instantly."
Forest Trolls are one of the toughest enemies in Kingdom Rush: they have the most health of all regular enemies, tied with the legendary [Twilight%20Golem](Twilight Golem), and their regeneration prevents low-level towers from slowly wearing them down. Even [Rain%20of%20Fire](Rain of Fire) does negligible damage to these behemoths. Thankfully, they are quite rare and have no armor, which should be exploited to the fullest.
