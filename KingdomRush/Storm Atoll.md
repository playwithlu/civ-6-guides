# Storm Atoll

 "Beware the Deep Devils! We believed these cruel fiends destroyed decades ago by the Linirean Royal Fleet and the Corsair Brotherhood. After the battle of [Port%20Tortuga](Port Tortuga), on the verge of being sunk by treacherous tides and the constant attacks of these nasty creatures, we have come ashore in the treacherous Storm Atoll."
 "Here we prepare for battle, near the ruins of a shrine to Regnos, Lord of the Sea. Pray that Regnos will protect Linirea's defenders!"
Storm Atoll is the seventeenth level in Kingdom Rush: Frontiers and the second level in the Rising Tides mini-campaign. The secondary hero [The%20Black%20Corsair](The Black Corsair) appears in this stage.
