# Beanstalk

A Beanstalk is a piece of scenery that appears in the stage [Grimmsburg](Grimmsburg).
Description.
A small, unassuming plant in the corner of the level has nothing to draw the player's attention besides the open space around it. By clicking on it however, the Beanstalk can be gradually grown up to its full (off-screen) height.Â 
Once it's fully grown, a person (presumably Jack) will peek out from behind then climb up the stalk. A second later, he drops down a treasure chest awarding the player 150 [gold](gold).
