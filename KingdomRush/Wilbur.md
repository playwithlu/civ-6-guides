Lore.
WHO WAS THE MASTERMIND BEHIND THE DWARVEN TECHNOLOGY?
One of the many mysteries of Linirea is the origin of the technologies used to build the factories and machinery of the Dwarven kingdom.
Who was the mastermind that planned and constructed such complex systems?
The answer was almost lost in the sands of time until I came across an ancient tablet that revealed it: It was Wilbur, the dwarven inventor.
He was one of the only survivors of the [Dwaraman%20Gates](Dark outbreak) in the [Tainted%20Pit](Hollow Mountains); He had departed to explore the world on his gyrocopter a few moons before the massacre and learned about it upon his return to the dwarven lands. This tragedy almost shattered his soul and pushed him to join forces with the Elves in an effort to avenge his kind.
He was publicly admired by many but secretly envied by some, like [Tramin](Tramin), who always saw himself as a rival to Wilbur.
Some legends say he escaped the cold hands of death by resorting to his inventions, changing his failing flesh for mechanical parts, but the truth about this still remains a mystery.

Tips and Tricks.
Wilbur is a flying hero that excels in demolishing nearby foes with a barrage of [True%20Damage](true damage) projectiles and abilities. His main source of damage potential lies in his regular attacks; they deal impressive true damage per shot at a fast rate of fire. Wilbur's skills help supplement his powerful regular attacks; in the form of tactical abilities engineered to weaken and slow as many enemies possible. With his PewPew Drones, Wilbur's presence is enhanced as 4 drones help thin crowds in either a path, or globally, or can be used on a single target to help critically injure or eliminate it on the spot. Overall, Wilbur's innovative inventions when managed well ensures technological combat supremacy across the battlefield.
Unlike other flying heroes, Wilbur can attack enemies directly beneath him. This further increases Wilbur's versatility as he does not have to be micromanaged constantly for his regular attacks to hit compared to other flying heroes.
