# Anurian Plaza

 "Look, General! See how they flee as our mighty army marches in with relentless strength. We only need to defeat their garrison and this place will be ours, but do beware, I sense something... odd in the magic emanating from the place. Could this be the power of darkness I'm sensing? If I'm correct, they must be stopped without a moment to waste."
