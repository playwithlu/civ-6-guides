Tips and Tricks.
Durax, together with his Crystallites serve as both melee and ranged heroes that excel in stalling, disrupting, harassing and damaging both isolated foes and groups of enemies. All of Durax and his Crystallites' attacks and abilities deal [True%20Damage](true damage) and work well whether they are together or apart. Micromanagement is crucial when using Durax, this is because Durax and his copies are fragile and if left unattended, will shave off potential damage for a long duration when one of his copies are eliminated, which is compounded if the original Durax dies. Overall, while fragile, Durax serves as a prime example of glass cannon units that can stay strong whether united or divided.
