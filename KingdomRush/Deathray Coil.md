# Deathray Coil

Deathray Coils are a special addition to levels in earned by spending Upgrade Points in the towers tree of the [Upgrades](Upgrades).
Description.
Once the Deathray Coil upgrade has been bought, they will immediately replace the exit flags on any level, in all three gameplay modes. Each coil works independently of the other, striking at a single enemy that enters its targeting range.
A coil will zap an enemy approaching the exit with a spark of red lightning, dealing it 150-300 [True%20Damage](true damage). The coils are charged and ready from the beginning but have a cooldown of 180 seconds, which means they should not be relied on to keep leaking enemies at bay, but they can catch an occasional enemy that leaks through.
