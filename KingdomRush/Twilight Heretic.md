# Twilight Heretic

Twilight Heretics (Heretics on mobile version) are Twilight Elf Warlocks that fight with mysterious magic capable of dispatching soldiers quickly.
## Overview

"Warlocks corrupted by evil, they command forces beyond comprehension."
With their unearthly power, Twilight Heretics are very powerful enemies capable of dishing out heavy damage, as well as soaking up quite a lot of hits, thanks to their high HP and magic resistance.
Twilight Heretics, in addition to having a ranged attack, also possess two special spells: Grip of Darkness and Soul Consumption. The first one renders up to two barracks units and reinforcements immobile while dealing 135 physical damage with the shadowy grip. The men become target practice for enemies capable of dealing damage from afar, while those without a ranged attack will simply ignore them; however, these soldiers are not considered dead yet and thus will not respawn, essentially removing the men from play for a little while and allowing most enemies to walk past soldiers. The second ability instantly kills up to three units by draining their soul, temporarily boosting the Heretic's speed massively. Both of their abilities can target units from afar, and usually activate faster than most soldiers can react, much reducing the effectiveness of against them.
