# Gnoll Catapult

Gnoll Catapults are war machines used by the Gnolls to attack Aredhel, capital of the elves. They do not have an encyclopedia entry.
## Overview

Starting from wave 2 onwards in [Campaign](Campaign) mode, Gnoll Catapults will start to spawn on the crushed grass near the eastern corners of the map. They will then proceed to bombard the player's soldiers by throwing rocks at them.
Gnoll Catapults deal high area damage and can kill soldiers and reinforcements with ease. They have unlimited range, though they do not stay to kill all soldiers like other ranged enemies. Instead, they only fire several volleys before leaving. Letting a Catapult leave is not considered a leak, and does not reduce lives, but also does not grant the Catapult's considerably high bounty. Gnoll Catapults spawn every wave in [Heroic%20Challenge](Heroic Challenge) mode.
Gnoll Catapults also make an appearance in [Valor%27s%20Rest](Valor's Rest), the [Endless%20Challenge](Endless Challenge) level, in which they act very similar. However, they cannot be targeted by any attack, including [Thunderbolt](Thunderbolt). In addition, they have extra attacks, including a barrage of rocks, spiked balls (200 True Damage), bombs (300 damage), and barrels containing gnolls,
