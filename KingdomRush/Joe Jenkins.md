## Overview

Joe Jenkins is not a regular occurring enemy, there is only one of him in the game. He does not spawn from a wave, instead, he must first be annoyed enough to enter the fray. Joe appears to be a simple farmer tending to his [Critters](Sheep) in the top left corner of the map. Like all Sheep in the series, they can be tapped on until they pop, an act which causes the farmer to shake his pitchfork. Pop all his sheep, and he will be overwhelmed with rage and power, and march onto the path.
Joe Jenkins not only has high HP and attack but will also summon two ovine-ninja [Baa%20San](Baa San) to his aid. Joe can be brought into battle before even calling any of the waves.
When Joe fights against more that one unit, he will summon Baa San. He can also summon Baa San after a certain period of time if not blocked.
Furthermore, Joe possesses a special attack move, attacking 3 times in rapid succession. This allows him to clear through low-level soldiers or even fragile heroes with ease.
