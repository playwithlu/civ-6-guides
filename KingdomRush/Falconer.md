# Falconer

Falconer is an enemy found in , first encountered in [Wizard%27s%20Landing%20%28DLC%29](Wizard's Landing (DLC)).
## Overview

"Trained from a young age to be a dreadful duo. Falconers and their eagles can disrupt enemy lines with ease at short or long range."
Strategy.
Falconers are armored soldiers with eagles that they will send after nearby units if they get close enough. As the only armored soldiers of Hammerhold short of Elephants, they can be rather tricky to deal with effectively. Area of effect abilities that bypass armor will work well on them. If they are killed before they send their eagles, the eagles will die with them.
