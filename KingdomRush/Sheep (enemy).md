# Sheep (enemy)

&lt;tabber&gt;Kingdom Rush=
Sheep are special flying enemies that only appear in the [Iron%20Challenge](Iron Challenge) of [Castle%20Blackburn](Castle Blackburn). They have no encyclopedia entry.
## Overview

Unlike normal sheep, which are polymorphed from other enemies by [Sorcerer%20Mage](Sorcerer Mages), these sheep spawn directly from entrances. Like all other sheep, they can be clicked to death. Sheep will either follow the same path as [Black%20Hag](Black Hags) or follow a normal path to the exit.
Appearances.
Sheep are a special enemy appearing only in the [Iron%20Challenge](Iron Challenge) of [City%20of%20Lozagon](City of Lozagon). 
## Overview

Unlike normal Sheep, which are polymorphed from soldier units by [High%20Sorcerer](High Sorcerer)s, these Sheep spawn directly from entrances. Like polymorphed sheep, they can be tapped to death. Sheep cannot be blocked by units. They are listed twice in the City of Lozagon Iron challenge because at the very end of the challenge, a hyper-speed sheep will bolt along the bottom path as a surprise.
