# Sarelgaz's Lair

Flash version:
 ""General! We have need of you and your brave men! The late [Vez%27nan](Vez'nan)'s caused trouble from beyond the grave. While you were battling him, he sent one of his hordes to wake up one of the dreaded spider queens, [Sarelgaz](Sarelgaz)!"
 "We thought the spider queen would never wake up again, but Sarelgaz has, and with her powers over darkness she's taken control of Vez'nan's remaining troops. You must vanquish them, and slay Sarelgaz!"
iOS and Love2d version: 
"General! We have need of you and your brave men! Sarelgaz one of the dreaded spider queens, has awoken!"
"We thought they would never wake up again, but Sarelgaz has, and with her powers over darkness she's taken control of Vez'nan's remaining troops. You must vanquish them, and slay Sarelgaz!"
Sarelgaz's Lair is an elite stage in [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush). It requires the [Premium%20Content](Premium Content) in the Flash version.
[Campaign](Campaign).
Flash.
The Flash version of Kingdom Rush has different waves to the other versions of the game. Waves are the same up to and including Wave 10, but after that there are differences in the entrances, numbers and enemies themselves. As such, your strategies for the level should change to reflect the different enemies. Although wave 11 lists 10 Shamans, it actually only spawns 9.

Much like the Campaign, there is another difference on the Flash version, albeit only for a single wave here.
