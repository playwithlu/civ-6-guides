# Spider Nest

 "Spider nest, spider nest..."
The Spider Nest is a Special Tower that only appears in [Silveroak%20Outpost](Silveroak Outpost). It houses a [Spider%20Matriarch](Spider Matriarch) laying eggs that hatch into [Spider%20Hatchling](Spiderlings) that engage and attack enemies.
## Overview

When an enemy enters the range of the tower (320), the Spider Nest will spawn up to 3 Baby Spiders (depending on the level of Spiderlings) from the eggs surrounding the tower to engage enemies. These Baby Spiders will fight until their HP depletes. The spiders give 4 gold each upon death. After 15 seconds, a Spider Matriarch will emerge to lay new eggs.
Abilities.

 "Sticky!"
Weaves a sticky net around the tower, slowing enemies that step on it.
Spiderlings.
 "Here comes the spider-man!"
Adds additional eggs, to a maximum of three.
Spider's health degrades over time; -9 HP per 2 seconds.
Strategy.
Unlike most special unit towers like mercenary camps, the Matriarch in this one respawns every available spider for free. Sticky Web can be ignored because its effect is almost non-existent.
