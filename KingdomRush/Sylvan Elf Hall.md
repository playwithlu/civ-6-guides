# Sylvan Elf Hall

The Sylvan Elf Hall is a only available in [Silveroak%20Forest](Silveroak Forest) and [Fungal%20Forest](Fungal Forest). Once built, it allows training of Sylvan Elves: expensive but powerful soldiers who will attack enemies with bow and glaive.
Description.
"Sylvan Elves are masters of bow and glaive. They will join your cause... for a price."
The Sylvan Elf Hall first appears as an old and decrepit building. After being repaired for a cost of 100 [gold](gold), it will allow thrifty generals to train up to a maximum of four elf warriors, who can be hired for a cost of 100 gold each.
The high cost of Sylvan Elves, in addition to their lack of respawning ability, is compensated by the fact that they are possibly the most versatile soldier in the game. They deal 25-50 damage with both their arrows and double swords, and a full team of four can effectively take down almost any enemy in the stage. Effective use of rally points can keep these soldiers alive for the entire Silveroak Forest level. They regenerate 20 HP per 0.5 second when not in melee combat. Unfortunately, they lose much effectiveness in Fungal Forest: [Noxious%20Creeper](Noxious Creeper)s can overwhelm them with their army of [Mutated%20Hatchling](Mutated Hatchling)s, [Rotshroom](Rotshroom)s can put them at death's door with their spores, making them very vulnerable to other enemies, while the [Swamp%20Thing](Swamp Thing)'s area attacks can wreck all four elves in seconds in melee or even from afar.
Be careful; in Silveroak Forest, all enemies that the elves will face in campaign mode either have armor or can dodge attacks. In the Iron Challenge, one of the Sylvan Elf Halls is located further to the right of the screen and can be used against Giant Spiders and Spider Matriarchs to a great effect.
One of the possible costumes of fully upgraded [Call%20Reinforcements](Reinforcements) in is a reskin of the Sylvan Elf, with similar blades and arrows.
