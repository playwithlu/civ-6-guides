# Snowstorm

Snowstorm is a scenery that only occurs at the stage [Dragons%27%20Boneyard](Dragons' Boneyard).
## Overview

When a snowstorm occurs, the battlefield becomes foggy as snow and heavy winds arrive.Â The snowstorm freezes a couple of towers, forcing the player to tap each frozen tower several times to reactivate it again, just like with the [Svell%20Druid](Svell Druid). The snowstorm occurs at certain waves in [Campaign](Campaign) and [Heroic%20Challenge](Heroic Challenge), and it occurs throughout the whole [Iron%20Challenge](Iron Challenge), which distracts the player even more.
