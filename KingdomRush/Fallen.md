# Fallen

Fallen are enemies in . They do not usually spawn from entrances like most other enemies (see exception below), but rather from killed [Immortal](Immortal)s and by [Sand%20Wraith](Sand Wraith)s.
## Overview

"Reanimated corpses of once great warriors."
Fallen are sort of a "second life'" of [Immortal](Immortal)s: They still deal the same amount of damage, but are slower, much less durable and take less life.
Fallen also periodically spawn from sarcophagi created by [Sand%20Wraith](Sand Wraith)s, and from obelisks summoned by the [God%20King](God King). In the [Iron%20Challenge](Iron Challenge) of [Nazeru%27s%20Gates](Nazeru's Gates), they spawn directly from an entrance. Even when spawned from entrances, Fallen have no [Gold](bounty).
