# Demon Spawn

&lt;tabber&gt;
Demon Spawn are enemies that damage nearby soldiers upon death (like [Demon%20Lord](Demon Lord)s and [Demon%20Hound](Demon Hound)s) and are resistant to magic.
## Overview

"Terrible infernal creatures that explode when they die, damaging nearby soldiers."
Demon spawn are terrible enemies to confront. They are relatively durable, capable of withstanding quite a number of attacks. While the exact damage dealt by their infernal combustion is somewhat random, it can take down basic in a single explosion, allowing other demons to skim through your defenses without being perturbed. This makes demon spawn doubly dangerous to troops. They are especially more dangerous on Hard [difficulty](difficulty): the 20% health boost brings their HP to the magic number of 300, making them spawn [Skeleton%20Knight](Skeleton Knight)s instead of [Skeleton](Skeleton)s in [Graveyard](Graveyard)s.
## Overview

They are the basic demon enemy and are commonly found in the Extradimensional Menace adventure.
