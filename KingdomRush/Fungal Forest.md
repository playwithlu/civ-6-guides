# Fungal Forest

 "There's no rest for the wicked... and thus, none for the good guys either. A messenger eagle has arrived from the [Sylvan%20Elf%20Hall](Elven Garrison) in the [Rotten%20Forest](Rotten Forest) . The Woods are still corrupted by evil, and our Elven allies are repelling attacks by horrible monsters"
 "A new dark power is rising, attempting to expand its domain beyond the forest's depths. Hurry, general, we must go to assist our Elven friends, and forever vanquish evil from that ancient forest!"
Fungal Forest is the sixteenth stage in [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush), comprised of fifteen waves.
