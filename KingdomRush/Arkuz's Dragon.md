Arkuz's dragon is a large blue dragon that serves as [https%3A//kingdomrushtd.fandom.com/wiki/Arkuz](Arkuz')s mount in Kingdom Rush Vengeance. It first appears in the 11th level, [https%3A//kingdomrushtd.fandom.com/wiki/Jokull%2527s_Nest](Jokull's Nest).
Appearance.
The dragon is larger than all of the dragon heroes in game. It has two large horns slightly curved at the end and two pairs of two teeth protruding from it's lower mouth as well as small spikes at the bottom of it's chin. The dragon's eyes stay curved downwards, strongly resembling anger or defiance. 
Both wings of the dragon are covered in a white trim and have multiple small tears. The dragon has many white trims surrounding it's body, extending all the way down to it's long tail.
[https%3A//kingdomrushtd.fandom.com/wiki/Arkuz](Arkuz) holds the dragon through reins, tied at the two curved horns while sitting on the dragon's back. He occasionally let's go of one rein and raises his fist to taunt the player.
The dragon is not bipedal like [https%3A//kingdomrushtd.fandom.com/wiki/Eiskalt](Eiskalt). It has two large back legs with sharp claws, and two front legs that are smaller and more hook shaped along with it's large wings.
