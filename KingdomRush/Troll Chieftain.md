# Troll Chieftain

&lt;tabber&gt;Kingdom Rush=
Troll Chieftains (Chieftain on the mobile version) can regain health and enrage allies. They are dangerous enemies which boast the highest leak penalty of any non-boss enemy in the entire series.
## Overview

"The chieftain can enrage their brethren, improving their combat abilities!"
The Troll Chieftain is one of the deadliest enemies in Kingdom Rush. The Troll Chieftain can heal himself slowly like other [Troll](Troll)s, and his high amount of hit points can make him a nasty thorn in any defense. He always appears at the head of a wave of trolls, beating his Drum of War. They cost 6 lives when leaked - more than any other enemy in the series.
His most powerful asset is the Chieftain Zeal, a powerful, albeit short-lived, ability that heals 50 HP to nearby trolls (except for [Troll%20Breaker](Troll Breaker) on Steam and mobile) in range, gives them extra 15-30 attack damage, 50% armor, 100% speed for 6 seconds. The speed boost allows trolls to ignore the mage's [Upgrades](slow curse) and dash past the player's towers, opening up a path for other enemies to get through.
Chieftain Zeal.
Chieftain Zeal is when the Troll Chieftains hit their drums, enraging trolls to have better protection and better damage. It may help trolls regenerate health faster than usual. Their max health remains the same, however.
Chieftain Zeals affect [Troll%20Breaker](Troll Breaker) on Flash only.

Strategy.
Troll Chieftains are dangerous because they empower other allies. They also have a long-ranged attack, which makes them more dangerous. They should be killed before a normal [Troll%23Legends_of_Kingdom_Rush](Troll Warrior) in order to mitigate the use of their abilities. Luckily, they are not the most common enemy in the Adventure.
