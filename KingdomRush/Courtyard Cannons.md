# Courtyard Cannons

Two Courtyard Cannons appear in the final level [Denas%27s%20Castle](Denas's Castle) in .
The cannons, modelled after the Dwarf bombard [500mm%20Big%20Bertha](500mm Big Bertha) from [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush) sit outside Denas's castle entrance. In the [Campaign](Campaign), the only appear in the second part of the battle (beginning of wave 9), once Vez'nan has destroyed the outer city walls. In [Iron%20Challenge](Iron Challenge) and [Heroic%20Challenge](Heroic Challenge) they appear from the start.
Description.
The cannons will launch barrels at random , covering them in a burning mixture of tar and feathers. While they are covered, the tower cannot be interacted with, nor will it attack or use any of its skills. There are a few exceptions to this, however. A rally point in use on a tower will negate the inability to attack, as it's only the tower base that is affected by the tar, but they cannot be repositioned.
In all modes, a tarred and feathered tower will free itself after 40 seconds. 
Strategy.
 A tarred and feathered tower can be cleaned up by tapping on it and purchasing the soapy bucket on offer. This immediately fixes the tower, allowing it to re-spawn defeated troops and start attacking again. 
Purchasing a soapy bucket costs 125 [gold](gold), however, as a tower will only remain covered for 40 seconds, gold can be saved if a less important tower is hit. 
Purchasing cheap towers in tower slots that you would otherwise leave empty is useful, as they can take shots the Courtyard Cannons, preventing your important towers from being disabled. 
On the Heroic and Iron challenges for the stage on the mobile versions, towers will remain covered by the tar and feathers indefinitely. On the Iron challenge, the cost to clear is reduced to 30 gold.
