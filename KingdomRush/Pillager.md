# Pillager

Pillagers are giant bandits wielding magical swords that allow them to bypass armor.
## Overview

"Magic resistant criminal warlords that can dispatch scores of soldiers with their infernal blades."
Unlike most giant enemies, the Pillagers' durability comes from their high magic resistance; other than that they only have a rather mid-high 2800 HP. In addition to that, instead of the physical area attack so common to giant enemies, Pillagers have an area magic attack (Flash only). This means that they can hit multiple soldiers at the same time while ignoring their armor. Due to this, they can easily decimate even the very tough and durable [Holy%20Order](Paladins) much faster than other enemies (Flash only). Combined with their magic resistance, Pillagers are brutal to any setup without enough funding for raw physical DPS, which is useless against [Raider](Raider)s.
