Damage over time tick duration is presumably glitched to tick every 0.03 seconds rather than 0.3 seconds, resulting in damage much higher than what is listed in game. The damage seems to be the listed damage in Steam and against armored enemies in general and the damage is physical if applied to armored enemies in both versions, but true damage against non-physically armored enemies in mobile.
Secondary.

Enemies receive 1 physical damage per 0.2 second when the tank moves over them.
