# Afflictions

Afflictions are status effects that enemies can receive. Enemies can receive multiple different afflictions at the same time, but the same affliction will not stack on enemies. Both allies and enemies can receive and inflict afflictions, though some beings are immune or resistant to certain types.
Poison.
Poison causes [True%20Damage](True Damage) over time to afflicted targets. The damage will not be very much in the matter of a few seconds, but poison can last for a long time and add up to hundreds of damage. Poison cannot be cured; it only stops once the effect runs out of time, but cannot kill enemies itself. Certain units are immune to poison damage, but none are exceptionally vulnerable.
Most types of poison can't kill their targets, as the damage automatically ceases if the afflicted unit is at 3 or less health. Poison also cannot stack, once something is poisoned it cannot be poisoned again until the effect wears off, even if the poison is coming from different sources.
Although the [Necromancer%20Tower](Necromancer Tower)'s Pestilence ability causes poison damage, it does not inflict enemies with the effect, but rather deals the damage as long as an enemy is in the range of the area of effect.
Stun.
Stunning causes afflicted units to become unable to perform any action during the effect. Stars will appear around their head for the time they are afflicted by the stun. It will also stop any regeneration.
Similar afflictions.
Though these afflictions are not stuns (and thus can stack with 'regular' stuns, as well as each other), their effects are virtually identical.
Immunities.
So far, only (mini) are immune to stuns from all sources.
Speed Reduction.
Speed Reduction causes units within the area of effect or units struck by the affliction to become slowed to certain degree. Slowing only affects movement speed, and all other stats are unchanged. Bosses and mini-bosses are immune to speed reduction.Â 
Because there are so many ways to reduce the speed to different amounts, almost every slow effect will stack.
Weakness.
Weakness reduces the damage of the afflicted targets, while sometimes increasing the damage they take as well.
Every form of Weakening can stack with a different one.
Burn.
Burning enemies take Fire Damage, a sub-form of [True%20Damage](True Damage), over time. This is not to be confused with normal fire damage, which simply hurts its victims once every time they are struck, like from [Rain%20of%20Fire](Rain of Fire). Burning enemies have a unique flame animation over their bodies to show that they are burning and not just taking raw fire damage.
Burning is generally rare for both sides to have, but more common in and than [Kingdom%20Rush](the first game).
