"Armored polar bears with incredible resilience. They charge at their enemies to be the first to battle."
Nanoq Warbears are polar bears equipped with armor and trained by Northerners to charge into battle and attack enemies. They have high health and armor and their damage is also quite high, as they attack twice per cycle.
