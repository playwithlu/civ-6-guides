# Arena

The Arena is a special game mode in [Legends%20of%20Kingdom%20Rush](Legends of Kingdom Rush) in which randomly generated combat scenarios are generated. The Arena is unlocked after defeating [Krum%27Thak%20Ragestorm](Krum'Thak Ragestorm). It has two modes, Quick Play and Daily Challenge. 
Features.
Each scenario consists of a single battle, the same as would be found in any Adventure. The main arena is similar in shape and style to the boss fight with Krum'Thak Ragestorm, with a crowd made up of greenskins, trolls and humans. Other features such as ponds, forestry, rocks or barriers will also appear randomly.
Before a battle starts, a team of one to seven and is generated. This is the only time more than one Legend can participate in a battle at the same time. The level of each is also randomised, as is the choice of Tier 2 and Tier 3 attack. All potential Legends and Companions are made available, despite who is still locked in the Adventure selection.
Up to three Diversifiers are added to the battle, adding buffs or debuffs to both enemies and heroes, or creating an outside effect that can influence either during play.
Quick Play.
Quick Play allows for new scenarios to be played over and over, with each one being randomly generated. The Difficulty can be changed between Casual and Normal play.
A set of Dice will roll a new scenario. There is no way to go back to a previous generated scenario, or any means to preview what it coming next.
Daily Challenge.
Each day a specific combination of scenario, along with the heroes and diversifiers will be created for all players to compete in. This scenario cannot be re-rolled, nor can the difficulty be altered. 
A final score is based on performance and various feats, and placed on the global leaders board, as well as a friends list and your recent scores.
Elite Enemies.
The Arena can feature any that has appeared in the main Adventures, with the exception of . Though it is unlocked after only one Adventure, all enemies from the entire campaign and post-game are immediately found in the Arena. In addition, there are also Elite enemies, that appear only in the Arena. These are stronger versions of other enemies, with new skills and increased HP and armor.
