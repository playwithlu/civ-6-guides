# The Ashen Lass

The Ashen Lass is a mystery node in the game [Legends%20of%20Kingdom%20Rush](Legends of Kingdom Rush) in the map [The%20Wild%20Moon](The Wild Moon), identified by a man sitting down.
At nightfall, we cross paths with a young red-haired woman.
"Oi! You're adventurers, ain't you?" she says carelessly as she approaches. She proceeds to show us a large pouch, covered in as much ash dust as herself. Inside, there are the most diverse pieces of junk.
"I am a novice adventurer! Tell you what. Teach me something about adventuring, and I will give you some of my own loot!"
We are pretty much speechless; she doesn't look like an adventurer at all. She doesn't mind our silence and eagerly asks: "What is the most important trait of a hero?"
Options.
Strength.
The young woman let the answer sink in. Seconds later, she rummaged through the pouch, and handed a crowbar over to us.
"This might come in handy to you!" she said with a really big smile, and then she left, leaving us all puzzled. Even though she was strange, her enthusiasm lifted our spirits.
Wisdom.
The young woman let the answer sink in. Seconds later, she rummaged through the pouch, and handed a torch over to us.
"This might come in handy to you!" she said with a really big smile, and then she left, leaving us all puzzled. Even though she was strange, her enthusiasm lifted our spirits.
Compassion.
The young woman let the answer sink in. Seconds later, she rummaged through the pouch, and handed a rope over to us.
"This might come in handy to you!" she said with a really big smile, and then she left, leaving us all puzzled. Even though she was strange, her enthusiasm lifted our spirits.
Ambition.
The young woman let the answer sink in. Seconds later, she rummaged through the pouch, and handed a pickaxe over to us.
"This might come in handy to you!" she said with a really big smile, and then she left, leaving us all puzzled. Even though she was strange, her enthusiasm lifted our spirits.
