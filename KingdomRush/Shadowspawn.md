# Shadowspawn

Shadowspawn are undead beings that spawn from dark blood.
## Overview

"Corpses animated by dark magic, with only one order in their minds. Destroy."
Contrary to their in-game description, Shadowspawn do not have any armor and have a speed of 'medium' instead of 'slow'. In iOS, their speed is considered faster than any other platform. They can be considered as improved [Zombie](zombies), trading slightly lower numbers for more health and speed as well as being able to be spawned from fallen barracks units by most other enemies introduced in the Forgotten Treasures mini-[campaign](campaign).
