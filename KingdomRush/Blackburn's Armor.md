# Blackburn's Armor

Blackburn's Armor makes an appearance in [The%20Ancient%20Ghosts](The Ancient Ghosts), spread across the level in pieces. They are fragments of the armor once worn by [Lord%20Blackburn](Lord Blackburn), who was defeated by the heroes of the first [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush) game at [Castle%20Blackburn](Castle Blackburn).
When each piece of armor is collected, it floats briefly before flying off the screen to an unknown location. Once all five pieces have been recovered, the eyes of the statue of Lord Blackburn in the center of the level will glow for five seconds, and during that period, all towers receive a 50% boost to their damage.
