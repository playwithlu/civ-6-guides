# The Crystal Lake

 "Our druidic allies feel uneasy about crossing the Crystal Lake. I have heard them whisper about the Grootslang, but they refuse to speak further about the issue."
 "We have sent scouts to find the [High%20Elven%20Mage](High Elven Mage)s, who study the magic of the crystals; we hope by the Light to find them in time!"
 "Our enemies are closing in, it's time to double our march and reach [the%20Unseelie%20Court](the Unseelie Court) before our strength wanes."
The Crystal Lake is the ninth level in . The [High%20Elven%20Mage](High Elven Mage) is unlocked in this level.
