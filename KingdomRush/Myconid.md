# Myconid

MyconidÂ is the boss in the elite level [Fungal%20Forest](Fungal Forest).
## Overview

"Very bad temper and strong boxing skills. Prepare to be assimilated."
Myconid is a gigantic mushroom with the second-lowest health of any boss in the series, even lower than the mini-boss [Cerberus](Cerberus) and tied with the [Paragon](Paragon)s. However, he moves rather fast for a boss and can also kill soldiers fairly quickly with his attacks, although he struggles against Earth Elementals and strong melee heroes.
Myconid has a special attack that he uses every 6 seconds, with which he spews spores around him, spawning bounty-less [Rotshroom](Rotshroom)s while dealing 300 poison damage over 7.5 seconds (4 damage per 0.1 second) to all soldiers around him. After death, 12 Rotshrooms spawn from its corpse.
