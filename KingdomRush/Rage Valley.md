Atop the hill overseeing the enemy compound is the Elder Shaman, who taunts you throughout the level with a grasp of the English language like no other goblin has. At his command are three different spells that can cause trouble for you, if you are not prepared.
 The first is a Healing Totem, a straight winged staff emitting an orange glow. Any enemies that pass by the totem are subject to its healing aura.
 The second is a Speed Totem, a curved winged staff emitting a blue glow. Enemies that pass by it are subject to its speeding aura, and move twice as fast for a few seconds.
 The third is a Fire Totem, a horned staff bearing a sinister face and emitting a red glow. The totem appears amongst your troops and immediately inflicts any or [Heroes](Heroes) with a [Afflictions](burn).
