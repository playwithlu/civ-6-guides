Tips and Tricks.
Lilith is a hybrid offensive hero that excels in executing tough foes in a hit and run playstyle, and assisting chokepoints with her buffed physique and abilities. Her main function is to deal with ground enemies like a melee hero, but she can also be positioned more like a ranged hero in various situations, While her stats aren't entirely made to be a reliable permanent staller, her skills have comparatively higher damage potential compared to various heroes. Similarly, her skills are great at crowd clearing and can deal high damage to a single foe in melee combat, with an added bonus of executing said foe, but along with her Resurrection and Heavenly Chaos, it is purely luck based. Players are recommended not to presume the best of fortunes when playing and micromanaging Lilith, and instead play her more pragmatically based on the situation at hand.
Compared to [Eridan](Eridan), her basic normal attacks and reliable tanking capability are inferior, as Eridan can also heal during his ranged attacks and can better deal with (groups of) flying enemies. However, her skills' damage outputs are much higher, as well as being True damage, and can be more valuable than the ability to tank a single target for a long period. Her Infernal Wheel, while unable to damage flying enemies, can deal just as much damage as Eridan's hero spell with nearly half the cooldown while keeping her Hero Spell slot free. Eridan is less micro-intensive and easier to use, though.
Guide to better micromanagement of Lilith
To properly micro Lilith, refraining from using her as a melee hero is a good start. The most common mistake for inexperienced players is putting Lilith in a constant melee position. This often forces her into casting Infernal Wheel on a bad spot, losing her overall damage. As the range of her ranged attack is slightly shorter than that of Infernal Wheel, this can be used to gauge which enemies are in range. Infernal Wheel works best when she's not in melee combat, but when it's on cooldown, you can freely use her for stalling and use Reaper's Harvest. Learning to track when she'll use Infernal Wheel can be very beneficial.
"It is okay to miss a few good hits with Reaper's Harvest, but Infernal Wheel will impact her result the most. Soul Eater can be ignored completely when microing."
As you level up Lilith, you'll want to prioritize upgrading her strongest skills first.
