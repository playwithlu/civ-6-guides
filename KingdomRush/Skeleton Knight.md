Skeleton Knights only spawn in [Graveyard](Graveyard)s, [Skeleton%20Pile](Skeleton Pile)s and when summoned by [Necromancer](Necromancer)s. (In the last case, they have no bounty). They're the stronger variant of the [Skeleton](Skeleton)s. They are spawned in Graveyards when a humanoid enemy with 300 or more maximum health is killed (like [Dark%20Knight](Dark Knight)s or [Demon%20Spawn](Demon Spawn)s on hard difficulty).
## Overview

"Skeleton Knights are the reanimated bones of once great warriors."
Skeleton Knights are more than 3 times stronger than their lesser undead comrades, the [Skeleton](Skeleton)s, with almost quadruple hit points, low armor and double the damage output, rivaling that of [Troll](Troll)s. Thus, they are deadly to low-level soldiers, and still pose a threat even to the mighty [Holy%20Order](Paladins). Swarming out from beneath their graves, if these warriors come out in big groups, they can clear out any unorganized, unprepared defense.
