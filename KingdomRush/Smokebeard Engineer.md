# Smokebeard Engineer

Smokebeard Engineers are dwarf mechanics capable of repairing destroyed dwarven robots on the battlefield.
## Overview

"Skillful engineers that repair and maintain complex machines in the blink of an eye."
Smokebeard Engineers are moderately armored and durable enemies most notable for their ability to repair disabled [Chomp%20Bot](Chomp Bot)s and [MechaDwarf%20MK.9](MechaDwarves), restoring their wreckages to full HP for the former and about 1/4 HP for the latter, giving them a second chance to reach the exits and forcing the player to kill them again. Smokebeard Engineers cannot use this ability when blocked. If they are killed, stunned or forced into combat while repairing a machine, the machine will automatically be destroyed.
