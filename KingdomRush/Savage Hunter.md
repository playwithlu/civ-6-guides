Savage Hunters are savages armed with blowing pipes, appear in the southern jungles in .
## Overview

"The Savage Hunters are quick agile warriors that shoot deadly poisonous darts."
Savage Hunters are less resilient than [Savage%20Warrior](Savage Warrior)s, but they shoot poisonous darts, which can quickly carve a hole in the player's ground defenses.
Poison deals 120 [True%20Damage](True Damage) over 4 seconds but the dart itself deals physical damage.
Strategy.
Always keep your hero away from Savage Hunter to avoid heavy wounds from their darts, unless you are using [Grawl](Grawl), who is armored and immune to poison.
Due to their numerous appearance, it is hard to micro manage soldiers away, so you should recruit fast-respawn [Assassin%27s%20Guild](Assassins) to inflict some damage before dying or call [Knights%20Templar](Knights Templar) with investment on Toughness to survive the poison.
[Bonehart](Bonehart), [Alric](Sand Warriors), and undead units cannot be poisoned. Strategically place [Necromancer%20Tower](Necromancers)Â where it can reach a healthy supply of corpses, and support with two or more [Battle-Mecha%20T200](Battle Mecha) to avoid [Blood%20Trickster](Tricksters) stealing the bodies, you should be able to resist Savage Hunters entirely.
They cluster together when attacking, therefore, any kind of level 4 Artillery is a hard counter to these enemies, if placed where they grouped to shoot at soldiers.
Consider grouping soldiers at the back, forcing the Savage Hunters to enter the range of towers.
