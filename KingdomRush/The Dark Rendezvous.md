= The Dark Rendezvous =
We spot a decrepit tavern at the foot of a mountain and decide to get closer. Once there, three rugged bandits stand in our way.
"Looking for trouble, pal? No heroes allowed here", says one of them.
Options.
Convince them to move away.
Requires one of: [Oloch](Oloch), [Knight](Knight), [Sylvan%20Elf](Sylvan Elf)
We spoke firmly about the importance of our mission and said we were just looking for a place to rest.
They reluctantly moved aside to let us in.
The boisterous tavern becomes silent the moment we put a foot inside, as a couple of unfriendly faces turn our way.
The bartender makes a hand gesture and everyone returns to their business.
"Bold of you to come to this place... but my men tell me you're after those pesky cultists, am I right? You can stay, but you'll regret it if you cause any trouble here", he says.
Arm wrestle!
Requires: Mighty unit
We saw some patrons arm wrestling for money and decided to give it a try.
We showed them our raw strength and won the prize pool!
Bribe them.
Requires: 50 gold
Knowing that everyone has their price, we took a small purse filled with coins and tossed it to them.
"Hmm... this will do!" said the leader, before stepping aside.
