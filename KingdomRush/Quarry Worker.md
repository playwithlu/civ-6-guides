# Quarry Worker

Quarry Workers are dwarf miners that can move underground to sneak past towers. They are first encountered in [Golden%20Brewery](Golden Brewery).
## Overview

"Frantic miners who have an insane love for digging. They often travel through underground tunnels to find the best minerals."
Quarry Workers are dwarf miners with pickaxes that spend most of their time moving underground, invulnerable to most attacks. Unlike [Dune%20Terror](Dune Terror)s, they do not surface to fight , but have to surface once every few seconds, rendering them temporarily attackable and killable. Compounding things further is that they don't get affected by attacks while they're performing their 'digging into the ground' animation. As such this is a very annoying ability that allows them to quickly reach your exit, but they cannot use it if blocked. They also can't use this ability when close to the exit, forcing them to walk the rest of the way.
Bug: If a Venus Flytrap eats it and launches it while it is underground, it will zip past all defenses underground at lightning speed, never emerging, and counting as a life lost.
