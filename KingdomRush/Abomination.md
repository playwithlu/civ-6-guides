# Abomination

&lt;tabber&gt;Kingdom Rush=
Abominations are the giant enemies encountered in the Curse of Castle Blackburn mini-campaign in [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush).
## Overview

"Giant flesh golems made out of mutilated limbs and bodies of many creatures."
Giant parodies of a humanoid, Abominations are more funny than scary. They are not good fighters compared to other giant enemies like [Forest%20Troll](Forest Troll)s, with their weak stats and lack of an area attack.
However, the "real" danger comes when they are killed. On death, an Abomination will explode in an area (scope: 200) for 250 [True%20Damage](True Damage), which can easily destroy barracks troops and if not careful, [Heroes](Heroes).

## Overview

"Giant flesh golems made out of mutilated limbs and bodies of many creatures."
Giant parodies of a humanoid, Abominations are more funny than scary. They are not good fighters compared to other giant enemies like [Saurian%20Brute](Saurian Brute)s, with their weak stats and lack of an area attack.
However, the "real" danger comes when they are killed. On death, an Abomination will explode in an area, which can easily destroy barracks troops and if not careful, heroes. Like its counterpart in [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush), the Frontiers version of Abomination does also deal 250 [True%20Damage](True Damage) in an area of 200 upon death.
During full Moons, the Abomination gains an unexpectedly dangerous boost in speed. Paired with their enormous health pool and death explosions, unless countered with AOE attacks, stunned or [Instant%20kill](instantly killed), they can easily breach your defenses.
