Strategy.
Try to keep your units without magic resistance out of range of the Blasteon at all times and snipe them from a distance, as both its abilities can be devastating to any hero without a good amount of health, especially glass cannons. You could try bursting the Blasteon down with high amounts of melee damage from a hero like the Barbarian, but it is extremely risky.
