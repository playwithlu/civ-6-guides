# Saurian Deathcoil

Saurian Deathcoils are Saurian snipers armed with deadly long-ranged crossbows.
## Overview

"Trained to develop perfect accuracy, these elite Saurians wield deadly advanced crossbows."
Saurian Deathcoils fire slowly but can dish out a lot of damage (100 [True%20Damage](True Damage) per shot) and have an extraordinary range: nearly half of the map! This range allows them to sniff out soldiers, all while staying away from the range of other towers. They can be an extreme nuisance because they can clear soldiers extremely quickly for other enemies to pass through, though as a result, they progress extremely slowly towards the exit.
