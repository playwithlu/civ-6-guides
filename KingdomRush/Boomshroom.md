# Boomshroom

Boomshrooms are volatile living fungi that live in the Faery Forest in .
## Overview

"A very unstable variety of mushroom that explodes when threatened."
Boomshrooms are individually weak but fast and extremely numerous: though they only have 75 HP and no resistance, they usually come in huge groups of 10 or more, making Druids essential to deal with them.
However, the real danger comes when they are killed. When killed or blocked, Boomshrooms violently explode, dealing 40 physical area damage. While it might not seem that much, Boomshrooms are extremely numerous, so the damage can quickly rack up - enough to kill soldiers and heroes if one isn't careful.
They can be transformed into [Munchshroom](Munchshroom) by [Fungus%20Breeder](Fungus Breeder).
