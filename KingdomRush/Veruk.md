# Veruk

Veruk the Orc Gladiator is a free in . Veruk is unlocked at the tutorial stage: [Vez%27nan%27s%20Tower](Vez'nan's Tower).
Description.
"Veruk, the honored orc tribal warrior, escaped a life of slavery at the gladiatorial pits in favor of one of leadership among the warmongers. He now spends his newfound freedom aiding his fellow greenskins in their flight. "
Veruk, the Warmonger leader, stands proudly in front of his forces as he watches the plains that will soon become a battlefield.
He rubs his wrists remembering the shackles that once stole his freedom, the same shackles that would come off once a day when he was forced to fight as a gladiator, turning the sands red with the blood of beasts and his fellow greenskins to stay alive.
As the years went by, he grew accustomed to seeing those who he called brothers perish on the sands, some would meet their end in the glory of battle, some would die just for defying their captors’ will. But Veruk fought on, year after year he fought on knowing that one day he would break free and with his newfound freedom lead the Warmongers to the gates of the human realm.
He now raises his weapon pointing at the enemy forces, and with a voice heavy with years of suffering, yawps “Chaaaaaaarge!!!”
More Lore (Veruk, the Warmonger's Leader).
The sun was setting over the tents, Veruk watched while an ogre and an orc set up a campfire, not far away, a goblin was busy bringing the meat that would soon be cooked. If he had said this could be true not too long ago, he would have been called delusional.
Ogres, Orcs, and Goblins do not mix; this is the motto he had heard since he was a young kid. He learned to stay away from those Greenskins whereabouts. Each race thought of themselves as higher and mightier than the others. This grudge was as old as time, so much that no one knew what started it anymore. The only thing worse than Ogres and goblins were the bandits.  Those humans were frail, but they compensated it with a sharp mind. [The%20Kingpin](The Kingpin)'s men knew how to set a trap that could capture even the smartest of Greenskins. He learned this the hard way: by falling prey to one while trying to save his kinsman.
The Bandits would not only steal his freedom but also treat them like animals, used to entertain the bloody tastes of their master: [the%20Kingpin](the Kingpin). Veruk rubbed his wrists, remembering the shackles that would come off once a day when he was forced to fight as a gladiator, turning the sands red with the blood of beasts to stay alive. It was on those sands that he learned to call any Greenskin a brother and helped them stay alive one more day, until that evening when he led a revolution against their captors and escaped.
His bravery became a legend on every Greenskin village and soon hordes of Orcs, Ogres, and goblins approached him looking for his protection and wisdom.  Old quarrels were forgotten, and Veruk became their leader and hero, an honor he never asked for. Now it's his fate and destiny to lead the Warmongers to the gates of the human realm and guide his people, the Greenskins, to victory.
