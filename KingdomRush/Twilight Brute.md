# Twilight Brute

Twilight Brutes are giant Twilight elves wielding two bloody hook swords. They serve as minibosses in the [Twilight%20Invasion](Twilight Invasion) [Endless%20Challenge](endless) stage in .
## Overview

"Enhanced by powerful magic, this Twilight elf is a dangerous living siege weapon."
One or two Twilight Brutes spawns every 10 waves in Twilight Invasion. They are functionally similar to giant enemies, being big, slow, tough and possessing an area attack, but their stats are much higher, on par with bosses. In addition, they share all immunities with bosses, and take away 20 lives if they escape. One unique trait they have from all other Endless minibosses, however, is a purple aura that boosts the attack of their Twilight Elf comrades in a large radius by 25% (much like the red aura of [Hi-Hi%20Enha](Hi-Hi Enha)). If he is killed, he will shrink and looks like a normal Twilight Harasser.
Strategy.
Rather than being a huge pile of HP with nothing but an area attack like most mini-bosses, the Brute is a huge pile of HP with nothing but an area attack and a damage-enhancing aura that can't be silenced. As such, keeping these foes separate from other enemies is a good idea, otherwise, they would plough through everything. A byproduct of this strategy is that the [Wild%20Magus](Wild Magus) can continue to attack this beast with impunity, as no other enemies will get ahead of it and reset the damage. Use melee heroes like Xin to slow it down. The danger comes with two Twilight Brutes, especially when they are close together, because their aura boosts damage to each other.
