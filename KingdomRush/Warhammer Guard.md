# Warhammer Guard

Warhammer Guards are dwarf soldiers, the second enemy encountered in outside of the tutorial and the first armored one.
## Overview

"Guards of the Dwarven Empire. The first line of defense against invaders and threats."
Warhammer Guards serve to introduce the player to physical armor. As such, they are still quite weak, and shouldn't be worried about if the player has at least one . Later on, they can be tackled by almost everything.
