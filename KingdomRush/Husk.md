# Husk

Husks are zombie-like creatures that appear in the [Rotten%20Forest](Rotten Forest) and [Fungal%20Forest](Fungal Forest) in [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush).
## Overview

"Fallen warriors, their bodies claimed by the forest, they are now only husks of their former selves."
Husks can be considered as more powerful versions of [Brigand](Brigand)s, with decent armour and a large pool of HP. A Husk spawns from a [Poison%20Pool](Poison Pool) whenever a soldier dies, similarly to [Skeleton](Skeleton)s and [Skeleton%20Knight](Skeleton Knight)s (though they don't spawn with the death of enemies - only friendly units).
