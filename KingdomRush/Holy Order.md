# Holy Order

The Holy Order is a Level 4 in [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush). Its soldiers, the powerful Paladins, are the toughest troops available in your roster, sporting the highest armor in the game as well as potent healing abilities. 
Paladins can also gain the ability to deal an area-of-effect attack, Holy Strike, which deals physical damage to all enemies in its radius. They regenerate 25 HP per second when idle.
The Holy Order is one of two possible upgrades from the [Knights%20Barracks](Knights Barracks). These soldiers of light are a beacon of hope in the darkness caused by [Vez%27nan](Vez'nan)'s invasion. They will not stop until justice is served!
## Overview

"Trains Paladins, an order of Holy Warriors. They are paragons of divine protection and heavenly defense."
Paladins are the epitome of durability. Their physical armor can be upgraded to high, making enemy physical attacks do far less damage to them. Their ability, Healing Light, allows them to restore their health when damaged, and their Holy Strike is extremely effective when taking down groups of weaker enemies, such as [Skeleton](Skeleton)s. Paladins can fight even Bosses for a good amount of time, due to their High armor and Healing ability.
Compared to its counterpart, the [Barbarian%20Mead%20Hall](Barbarian Mead Hall), the Holy Order's Paladins are far more durable, due to their armor and their ability to heal themselves. However, as they do less damage, they will require support when facing large amounts of enemies. They are also the only advanced tower with no way of attacking flying enemies.
