# Port Tortuga

 "For the past few weeks, sailors and fishermen have raised the alarm regarding eerie disappearances. Ships and people have been reported missing, vanishing mysteriously in nearby waters. Our Port Tortuga garrison, in the Pirate Islands, is requesting our aid."
 "We are still unsure of who or what is behind the disappearances, but our coastal villages are in danger, and our King is asking you to lead a small rapid response fleet to get to the bottom of this new menace."
Port Tortuga is the sixteenth stage in and the first one in the Rising Tides mini-campaign.
