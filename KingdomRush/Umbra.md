# Umbra

Umbra is the one of the two main antagonists and final boss in the main [Campaign](Campaign) of .
## Overview

"Umbra is not made of shadows, shadows are made of Umbra..."
At the beginning of the stage, Umbra is encased in a huge crystal on a high plateau, with [Lord%20Malagar](Lord Malagar) attempting to free him. Neither Umbra nor Lord Malagar can be attacked in this state. After wave 15, Umbra is freed, kills Lord Malagar and attacks the player.
Umbra does not move towards the exits (he summons [Shade%20Elemental](Shade Elemental)s for this purpose), instead only teleporting between the main path and the plateau, where he is invulnerable to all attacks, including ones with unlimited range.
After his health is depleted, Umbra splits into ten [Shred%20of%20Darkness](Shreds of Darkness), which will move toward the plateau in an attempt to reform Umbra. Umbra's health when reformed depends on how many Shreds of Darkness remain when he reforms. Umbra will also start destroying from the first reform. His attacks appear as blue lightning shooting out of his eyes.
Umbra must be defeated four times to be fully killed.
