## Overview

"Brilliant alchemists that use potions to heal their allies and cause havoc among their enemies."
Sulfur Alchemists are Dwarven Alchemists with a bag of potions that they throw at allies to heal or at the player's troops to damage. They introduce the player to magic resistance, and are the only enemy in the Dwarven Kingdoms that is resistant to magic. They serve the roles of healers and ranged attackers at the same time, allowing them to stand slightly behind other enemies as they throw their healing potions at them. However, they don't excel at either of these roles. 
Sulfur Alchemists cannot heal themselves (but can heal other Sulfur Alchemists) and also cannot heal mechanical enemies such as [Clockwork%20Spider](Clockwork Spiders), [Chomp%20Bot](Chomp Bots) and [MechaDwarf%20MK.9](MechaDwarf MK.9s).
Their ranged attacks deal physical damage.
