# Lesser Efreeti

Lesser Efreeti are minions summoned by [Nazeru](Nazeru) in .
## Overview

"These lesser Efreets do not grant any wishes, but you will wish them gone."
Lesser Efreeti are summoned in packs of three by Nazeru during the battle. They deal fairly high damage, but have very low health and can be killed fairly easily.
When Nazeru is low on health, he summons increasing numbers of Lesser Efreeti. [Nazeru](Nazeru) can also turn Barracks soldiers into Lesser Efreeti, so troops should be moved away from the exit when he appears.
They are not overly powerful, and their threat level pales in comparison to Nazeru himself, but it is still important to keep a close eye on them.
The [Archmage%20Tower](Archmage Tower)'s Twister ability will help a lot if [Nazeru](Nazeru) summons a lot of them.
