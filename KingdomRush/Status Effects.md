# Status Effects

Status Effects in [Legends%20of%20Kingdom%20Rush](Legends of Kingdom Rush) operate differently to [Afflictions](Afflictions) in the Tower Defense games. Status Effects rarely stay in place for more than one turn and can be stacked, resulting in an enemy or unit enduring two or even three effects at the same time. There are a number of unique Status Effects that are triggered by particular skills, or are limited to particular enemies or units.
Status Effects also have the additional component of being vital to trigger Epic attack conditions, and there are many unique states either created by enemies or self-induced by certain moves.
