# Snapvine

Snapvines are carnivorous plants found in [Snapvine%20Bridge](Snapvine Bridge).
Appearances.
There are five Snapvines in the [Campaign](Campaign) and [Heroic%20Challenge](Heroic Challenge) modes of Snapvine Bridge. They are initially passive and do nothing until they awaken. The first Snapvine wakes at the start of wave two, and a further inactive Snapvine wakes every following two waves, until wave ten, in Campaign mode. 
In the [Heroic%20Challenge](Heroic Challenge), one Snapvine wakes on every wave. Snapvines do not appear in the [Iron%20Challenge](Iron Challenge).
Description.
Every wave, whenever a unit (friendly or enemy) stands in front of a Snapvine, it will eat that unit (and all units standing in a line from it, in the same lane), instantly killing them. killed by Snapvines still give [gold](gold).
Snapvines cannot eat [Gorillon](Gorillon)s, [Ashbite](Ashbite) or [Bonehart](Bonehart). Snapvines do not manually target [Giant%20Wasp](Giant Wasp)s but can still swallow them when they stand in the same line with other units.
Tips &amp; Tricks.
When using melee heroes, pay attention to where he/she is going when fighting foes. It is easy for the hero to jump into melee with enemies and sit right in range of a Snapvine. This problem hardly arises with ranged heroes, since you could manually place them in a safe spot, and they do not move to fight foes.
