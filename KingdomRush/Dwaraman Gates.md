# Dwaraman Gates

"War is over or so we thoughtâ€¦"
"Because even as our Kingdom goes back to its former peace and prosperity, the messengers we sent asking for aid from the Dwarves never returned. And if there's something more troublesome than a loud dwarf, it's a silent one!"
"You must travel to their land and seek answers."
Dwaraman Gates is the twenty-first stage in and the first one in the Forgotten Treasures mini-[campaign](campaign).
