# Sword Spider

Sword Spiders are giant spiders dwelling in the southern continent home to the elves. They are cousins of the [Giant%20Spiders](Giant Spiders) and [Jungle%20Spider](Jungle Spider)s of the north.
## Overview

"Fierce spiders with blade-like legs as sharp as finely forged swords."
Just like other spiders, Sword Spiders are fast, numerous, resistant to magic and not quite durable. They can be killed easily with a combination of Barracks and Artillery, but avoid relying too much on Mages - the spiders will mostly shrug them off. Contrary to their in-game description, their damage is actually rather low so barracks soldiers and [Reinforcements](Reinforcements) can stall them for a long time.
