# Perython

Perythons are the basic flying enemies in .
## Overview

"Born of twisted magic, these flying beasts are often seen carrying gnolls into battle."
Being flying enemies, Perythons' goal is to reach the exits as quickly as possible, as they cannot be engaged by soldiers nor be in reach of druids. Though tougher than the [Gargoyle](Gargoyle)s and [Giant%20Wasp](Giant Wasp)s of the previous games, they aren't particularly hard to kill with archers and mages.
Certain Perythons are seen carrying [Gnoll%20Gnawer](Gnoll Gnawer)s, allowing the Gnolls to temporarily bypass soldiers and druids until the Perythons are forced to drop them. In the Hulking Rage mini-campaign, they can also carry stones that deal 75-100 area damage when dropped on soldiers.
