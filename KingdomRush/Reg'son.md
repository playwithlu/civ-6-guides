Tips and Tricks.
Reg'son is a melee hero specializing in [True%20Damage](True Damage) demolishing small numbers of enemies in melee combat. Unlike other melee heroes, Reg'son has a modest damage output and average durability due to lack of armor, however, with his very fast attacks dealing true damage and his skills, he can kill faster than many other heroes do. 
Reg'son is one of the best melee heroes around. Despite his low base damage, when fully upgraded, he can unleash devastating attacks from his Eldritch Blades, while remaining unscathed thanks to Eldritch Heal. His lack of armor limits his capability in directly confronting foes, but he can still stand for quite some time with a larger than normal health bar.
When using Reg'son, pairing him with good support towers that are able to handle groups, such as [Wild%20Magus](Wild Magus), [Arcane%20Archers](Arcane Archers) and [Forest%20Keepers](Forest Keepers) is a good idea, as the more enemies that die within Reg'son's Eldritch Heal, the more Reg'Son will heal, which complements his survivability by being constantly and consistently in the battle.
Overall, when paired with a strong choke point, Reg'son will thrive further by having a buffer to stall and wipe off most of the tough enemies while heavily wounding tougher foes. However, it should be noted that he is not very good at strengthening a weak chokepoint, since he lacks good crowd control.
