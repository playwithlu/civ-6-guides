# Pond of the Sage

 ""What I feared is true... [Polyx%20the%20Wise](Polyx, the Sage), delved too much into mysteries forbidden and now suffers the tainting grasp of corruption. Did he really think he could control the power of darkness and walk out unscathed? Defeat him and his followers before he's able to influence this land. Failure is not an option!""
