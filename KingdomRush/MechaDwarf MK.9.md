# MechaDwarf MK.9

MechaDwarves MK.9 are dwarves clad in slow-moving but very tough suits of powered armor. They are first encountered in [Clockwork%20Factory](Clockwork Factory).
## Overview

"Heavy powersuits operated by the best pilots of the empire. Capable of smashing whole armies with their strength."
MechaDwarves are armored dwarven walking mechs with drills and hammers. They are the first giant enemies (or second if you count the [Stonebeard%20Geomancer](Stonebeard Geomancer's) rock form) encountered in : slow but tough enemies with an area attack (80 physical damage, 12 seconds of cooldown). They look somewhat similar to the hero of the first [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush), [Hacksaw](Hacksaw). Their HP is relatively low by the standard of giant enemies, but they're also very resistant to physical attacks, being made of metal.
Being mechanical enemies, when reduced to 0 HP by non-artillery or means, a MechaDwarf leaves behind a wreckage that can be repaired to 25% health (240/300/360/405 hp) by [Smokebeard%20Engineer](Smokebeard Engineer)s and lasts for a few seconds; their bounty is only awarded once they are destroyed for good, either by waiting enough time for their wreckage to crumble, or interrupting the repairing engineer.
