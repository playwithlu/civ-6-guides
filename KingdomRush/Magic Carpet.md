## Overview

"After years of meditation they learned the secrets of the carpet magic, that now is used to protect the desert."
Strategy.
Flying units with medium magic resistance and attacks that deal area explosive damage, bypassing half of armor, they are among the biggest menaces of the skies of Hammerhold. They also have good health, so it will take very concentrated damage to ground them for good. Due to their sheer DPS, Bone Flingers are a good choice. Shaolin Temple has fairly efficient DPS as well against small groups, and will stun them often enough that they will not be able to attack, which can also be a negative, since it will make them move along faster.
