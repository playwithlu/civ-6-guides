Skills.
Surge of Flames 
 Ignus rushes towards an enemy on the front line in a fireball. The fireball deals damage to enemy units that come in its path. This damage is applied 30 times per second, to any enemy within an area with major axis 50 around Ignus. This generally amounts to 2-5 ticks of damage on an enemy, since Ignus moves very quickly while rushing. Upon reaching the target, Ignus will commence melee combat as normal. It can only be used on targets that aren't being blocked by units, and they cannot be too close to Ignus, the entrance, or the exit. The target Ignus rushes to will count as being blocked by Ignus from the moment he starts the rush (and the target he was blocking counts as unblocked at the same moment). "(Cooldown: 4 seconds)."
Flaming Frenzy 
 He emits a shockwave dealing damage and healing himself by 20% of the max health. "(Cooldown: 5 seconds)"
