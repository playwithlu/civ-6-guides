## Overview

"A siege vehicle that carriers soldiers safe from harm. Like a clown car but a lot less funny."
Large wooden Linirean siege wagons that contain several [Footman](Footmen) inside, War Wagons move slowly while spawning three Footmen at a time at periodic intervals. While they have no damage nor magic resistance, they have a good amount of HP and cannot be stunned or frozen by effects nor blocked by Barracks or Heroes. Their ability to spawn three Footmen that do not drop any gold when killed can be somewhat troublesome to a minor nuisance depending on how leveled your towers are. Overall, they aren't too big of a threat if taken care of early.
