Tips and Tricks.
Arivan is a ranged hero that excels in supporting his chokepoints with magic damage with great potential to nuke and disable a single strong foe. While Arivan lacks a means of fast travel, Arivan thrives when it comes to dealing damage to foes. Arivan does [True%20Damage](True Damage) via his default auto attacks, this meansthat he will have an easier time against enemies like [Sword%20Spider](Sword Spider)s. Accounting for his skills and cooldowns, Arivan can achieve a higher DPS against a single target compared to [Vez%27nan](Vez'nan).
Arivan's Hero Spell, Elemental Storm, is an extremely powerful skill that unleashes a giant spinning tornado which slowly winds its way up the path, dealing damage over time and randomly shooting ice and lightning at enemies. It can clear away huge groups of medium-health enemies, while greatly hindering and wearing down larger foes as well.
Arivan shines in Endless Mode where enemy resistance gradually increases over time due to his damage potential. Do be aware not be get overwhelmed due to Arivan's slow movement speed, however.
