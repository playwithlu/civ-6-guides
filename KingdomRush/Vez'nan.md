## Overview

"The most evil being you will encounter. Watch out for his evil bad jokes!"
Vez'nan is the main antagonist, the third and final boss in the main campaign of [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush). He is the first boss to have two different forms, which together have more health than all of the other bosses in Kingdom Rush except [Sarelgaz](Sarelgaz).
Boss Abilities.
• From Wave 9 onward, Vez'nan periodically casts a spell that disables towers. The spell is initially dispellable by clicking/tapping on the tower rapidly, however, after a few seconds, the spell becomes undispellable and will only end after approximately 10 seconds. As the stage progresses, Vez'nan will cast the spell simultaneously on more and more towers, making it nearly impossible to dispel all of them before they become undispellable. 
• Vez'nan can also summon [Demon%20Spawn](Demon Spawn) and [Demon%20Hound](Demon Hound)s from the summoning circles on the map.
•When his humanoid form is killed, Vez'nan will transform into a giant winged fire-breathing demon, which must also be killed. This form is significantly faster, allowing Vez'nan to easily reach the exit if he is near enough to it, but otherwise, it is actually weaker, since Vez'nan can no longer disable towers, summon demons or use the special Soul Drain attack.
[Trivia](Quotes).
Vez'nan has a full repertoire of jarring taunts, threatening phrases, and ironic culture references that he uses to unnerve his foes. Fortunately, he is easily ignored...

Tips and Tricks.
Vez'nan is a ranged magic hero that excels in decimating and disrupting groups of enemies unimpeded. All of his active abilities have a large area of effect radius once cast, and is one of the fastest heroes that can teleport to another location easily. Vez'nan requires great timing and skill management more so than other heroes, as he has potential to overkill groups of enemies with his skills alone.
Vez'nan can be best used behind either reinforcements or barracks troops, due to his low health, but once protected, he serves as one of the best heroes in the game at crowd control and demolishing foes. With Magic Shackles, Soul Burn, Arcane Nova, and a good chokepoint of soldiers, Vez'nan is more than capable of taking out wounded [Ettin](Ettins) or [Bandersnatch](Bandersnatches) alone.
An alternative tactic that can be utilized with Vez'nan is to adopt a hit-and-run strategy, to move and impact enemies with his area of effect skills from afar, and follow and isolate tough and tanky targets for either disposal or crowd control. With one of the fastest teleport animation, Vez'nan can be micromanaged to areas where he is needed the most.
Names.
The Demon has different names each time it is summoned.

Vez'nan is the immediate superior of the main protagonist of . After having escaped from the clutches of [Moloch](Moloch) (with the help of [Oloch](Oloch), Moloch's little brother), Vez'nan is once again ready to conquer Linirea for the second time.
## Overview

Vez'nan gives briefings to the player at the start of all stages, but only personally takes to the battlefield himself in the final level, [Denas%27s%20Castle](Denas's Castle), in [Campaign](Campaign) mode. He stands at the back of the level and cannot be attacked by anything.
In this level, tapping on Vez'nan when he's ready will cause him to shoot a green fireball at the enemy closest to the exit, dealing 800 [True%20Damage](True Damage) to the target and nearby enemies. This is enough to kill most enemies, except [Cavalier](Cavalier)s (who will only get dismounted) and [High%20Sorcerer](High Sorcerer)s (who have enough HP to survive).
At the end of wave 8, Vez'nan will focus his power to destroy the ramparts of the castle, killing the [Citadel%20Archers](Citadel Archers) and allowing his men to advance further, setting up the second part of the stage. Once wave 18 ends, he will focus his power to summon the [Archdemon](Archdemon), to which [King%20Denas](King Denas) will respond by tasking three of his men to drink a super serum, turning them into [Paragon](Paragon)s. At this point, Vez'nan can no longer fire the green fireballs; tapping on him when he's ready will instead cause the Archdemon to use its special slam attack.

BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR
Vez’nan stepped back and admired his work, his pentagram conjuration ready. His plan to conquer [King%20Denas](Denas’s) castle was in motion. The Dark Lord knew he had the element of surprise on his side, as no one had dared to attack Linirea since ancient times. All he needed now was an army that would grant him his victory.
There was nothing he wouldn’t do to make sure his campaign was successful, and making pacts with ancient entities was something he needed to do. He was fully aware that alliances like this demanded hefty payments, but since his soul was already bound by a previous pact he had made, he would have to bargain with something else.
He smirked at the thought of his old teacher, [Nivus](Nivus), finding out about his plans. The old wizard would find his actions despiteful and think of him as an abomination.
But the old man had never had as much power in his hands as Vez’nan had now, nor did he ever feel the intoxicating pulse of magic emanating from the jewel that whispered to him from the tip of his staff: the magnificent Tear of Elynie.
It was time. As soon as he started chanting his conjuration spell, the grass surrounding the pentagram rotted and the air became tainted with the stench of rotten flesh and sulfur.
Soon the heat became almost unbearable as the Ghost Kings materialized on the now corrupted field. There was something utterly unnerving about the ways the brothers mirrored each other’s movements as both pairs of hollow eye sockets fixed on him.
Vez’nan started with the negotiations immediately. He wanted to be done with this deal as fast as possible to be able to focus on the next step of his plan. There was no time to lose.
After much discussion, the kings agreed to grant him the command of their undead army to secure Linirea’s throne. Their price was also set: they required the souls of every enemy soldier fallen in battle. The price did not bother Vez’nan at all, as it was merely collateral damage. A means to an end.
They signed the contract with blood and soon the kings disappeared from the field. The deal was done.
“Now we are ready,” the crimson red tear whispered to Vez’nan. “Let the journey begin.”
