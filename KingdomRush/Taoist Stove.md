# Taoist Stove

Taoist Stoves appear in the Elite Levels of the Rise of the Dragon Mini-[Campaign](Campaign).
They are scenery items which slowly charge up until they glow. This charging takes 60 seconds. Once charged, a Stove can be clicked to instantly kill all enemies in a decently sized radius. The enemies get absorbed into the Stove, and the player will receive half of their bounties. Clicking these without any enemies in range will not activate them, similarly to the [Haunted%20Gem](Haunted Gems) in Cursed Bargain.
