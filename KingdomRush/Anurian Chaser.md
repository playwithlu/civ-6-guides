# Anurian Chaser

Anurian Chasers are ranine enemies, and the basic enemies of the Anurian Wetlands, the fourth [environment](environment) of , introduced in the Subaquatic Menace [Campaign](Mini-Campaign).
## Overview

"These agile hunters have a strong set of legs that use to jump over their enemies to cause a devastating impact."
Frog-men with shields and double-sided halberds, Anurian Chasers are the foot soldiers of the Anurians. They sport medium armor, deal moderate damage, appear in groups and have the very dangerous ability to jump towards your troops, quickly bypassing your defense while dealing 60 area physical damage upon landing. Furthermore, their large numbers will allow them to quickly overwhelm barracks while subsequently leaking through.
They will not use their leaping ability on [Jun%27Pai](Jun'Pai) or if the landing point is near the exit.
