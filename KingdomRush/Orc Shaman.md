Starting with the 2/7/2024 Balance Patch, the Orc Shaman is FAR more competitive as a usable tower than it ever has been before. It's damage has a lower max, but has a much lower variance and its abilities have been drastically improved as well. Now it functions more effectively as a damage and support tower.
