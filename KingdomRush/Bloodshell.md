# Bloodshell

Bloodshells are a giant crab-like Deep Devil, encountered in the Rising Tides mini-[campaign](campaign). They have the highest physical armor of any enemy in (excluding [Ghost](Ghost)s and [Phantom%20Warrior](Phantom Warrior)s).
## Overview

"Formidable warriors, their steel-like spiked carapace renders them invulnerable!"
Bloodshells lack the unstoppable true damage power of [Saurian%20Brute](Saurian Brute)s. Rather, their specialty is to shrug off almost all kinds of damage: (including Core Drill, Dynamite, Fat Boy) is absolutely harmless to them due to their passive ability, and their great physical armor makes it so they are effectively immune to physical damage (With 64000 EHP on veteran). Even a fully upgraded [Rain%20of%20Fire](Rain of Fire) can't kill them due to their extremely high HP. Basically, Bloodshells can be considered a stronger [Dark%20Slayer](Dark Slayer) that forces the player to use [Wizard%20Tower](Wizard Tower)s, which are useless against the [Bluegale](Bluegale)s.
