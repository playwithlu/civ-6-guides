Lore.
"After many tough days in the harsh desert, our patrol was losing hope. Our mission was to check rumors of hidden tunnels, thought to be a shortcut through the desert. But the harsh sun and endless sands tested our endurance, and fatigue had begun to take its toll.
When it seemed we might never find the rumored path, one of our scouts noticed an unusual mark in the distant dunes. The tunnels! We thought this was the shortcut we needed, a crucial advantage for defending Hammerhold. And so, we ventured deep into the subterranean tunnels.
Our mistake became painfully clear when torchlight revealed hundreds of eggs. And then the realization daunted us. We weren't in ordinary tunnels; we were inside the Sandwormâ€™s Nest! Before we had time to react, the eggs started to stir and crack open. Young worm-like creatures emerged with a loud shriek. 
All at once, the sand beneath us began to shake, announcing the awakening of the fearsome Hollow Mother. With fierce maternal protectiveness, she rose to defend her realm. We fled in panic. Some were too slow. Their screams reverberated through the winding passages. Only a handful of us, myself included, narrowly escaped the chasing sandworms. 
A foreboding sensation lingered. We knew she wouldn't easily forgive our intrusion, and her hunger for vengeance remained unquenched."

Strategy.
This tower attacks very similarly to the Ignis Altar by designating a zone, in the form of a dark pit with giant teeth, where constant damage with no variance will be dealt to enemies that walk over it. But the time between the tower's action and the zone appearing is much faster than the altar and deals even more damage, but the attack itself doesn't get to slow enemies with an upgrade. It also has reasonably good attack range.
The mother worm can slow enemies in a group at a long distance away from the hollow with Mucus Gob. It's cheap and quite reliable for its costs.
Call of the Desert is the hollow's method of harassing enemy lines with constant unit spawn just like [Bone%20Flingers](Bone Flingers)' Walking Dead upgrade. The dune terrors it spawns have less health and deal less damage than the skeleton minions, but they can be spawned faster and the upgrade is cheaper than the Walking Dead.
Snack Hour allows the mother worm to leave the hollow and devour enemies in a group before returning to the hollow. It it the first tower instant kill that works on enemies in a group, but it can also accidentally consume friendly units and heroes, so it is best to place the hollow in the middle or back of the path to avoid a case of friendly fire rare to the series.
