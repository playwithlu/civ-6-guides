Drum Elephant is an enemy found in , first encountered in [Hammerhold%20Streets%20%28DLC%29](Hammerhold Streets (DLC)).
## Overview

"Rallying allies with their never-ending beat, the Drum Elephants are a mobile source of inspiration that stops at nothing in battle"
Strategy.
The second mini-boss to be encountered outside of any Endless level in the series apart from Cerberus and the "War" variety, Elephants are horrifically durable foes who make their presence known with constant trumpeting. They are extremely slow, but have incredibly high physical armor and health, and these Elephants boost the movement speed of nearby enemies by 50% for 2 seconds, as well as healing them for 60 hp over 2 seconds. They can do this every 5 seconds. Like the [War%20Elephant](War Elephant), they will trample nearby troops at a rate of 11 damage per 0.2s.
As mini-bosses, numerous abilities and instant kills will be ineffective on them, so fighting them without amplified Blazing Gems and/or heroes with magic attacks would be close to suicidal. Even the former option will be quite challenging in The Grand Arena as some Elephants may spawn rather early in the wave cycle.
[Wicked%20Sisters](Wicked Sisters) may be most useful due to their heavy poison damage and wide rally points enhanced by Nimbus 4000.
