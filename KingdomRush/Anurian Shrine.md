# Anurian Shrine

The Anurian Shrine appears in [Anurian%20Plaza](Anurian Plaza) and [Pond%20of%20the%20Sage](Pond of the Sage). 
Description.
The Anurian Shrine is a small ranine structure, appearing as the head of an Anurian. The crystal embedded upon its forehead shimmers as it slow charges energy and glows yellow when fully charged. Tapping the fully charged structure sends out a wave that envelops any unit within its range, and renders them impervious to damage for a short period of time.
Strategy.
Their greatest use is to completely nullify the tri-volley attack of [Anurian%20Erudite](Anurian Erudites) and keep them still to buy other towers more time to kill them.
