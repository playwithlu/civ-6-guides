# Nok, the Havoc

Nok, the Havoc is one of three aspects that make up the evil spirit [M%C3%B3r-Ga-Nok](Mór-Ga-Nok). It is one of the three final bosses in [The%20Wild%20Moon](The Wild Moon) in [Legends%20of%20Kingdom%20Rush](Legends of Kingdom Rush).
Traits.
 Ethereal Shield : When the HP of one aspect of [M%C3%B3r-Ga-Nok](Mór-Ga-Nok) drops to 0, it gains a shield that renders it invulnerable to all damage. The shield is destroyed once all aspect's HP is less than 6.
Strategy.
&lt;tabber&gt;
Phase One=
Nok is a "brute" of the team. Since Mór is such a big threat, kill Mór first. Nok targets the closest target, so make sure your glass cannons are not adjacent to a possible target.
Phase Two=
Nok, like Ga, only gets an health buff. Follow instructions from Phase One.
Phase Three=
Nok is a large brute. If you are trying to end a run with Nok at the end, invest in high single-target damage. Examples of which include [Arcane%20Wizard%23Legends%20of%20Kingdom%20Rush](Arcane Wizard's) Disintegrate, [Reg%27son%23Legends%20of%20Kingdom%20Rush](Reg'son's) Vindicator, and [Asra%23Legends%20of%20Kingdom%20Rush](|Asra's) Onyx Arrows.
