# Crimson Valley

 "The mighty [Knights%20Templar](Templar Order) joins us as we reach the breathtaking Crimson Valley, a name it's earned for being the Ma'qwa tribe's hunting grounds. We've established a base camp here and given the men some time off to rest and recover, but we must remain vigilant."
 "None of us has ever seen one of the Ma'qwa, but the rumours about them are... unsettling, to say the least."
Crimson Valley is the seventh stage in . The [Knights%20Templar](Knights Templar) are unlocked in this stage.
