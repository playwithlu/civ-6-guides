## Overview

"Defender of the righteous, punisher of the dark, protector of the innocent, crusher of evil beings, Gerald Lightseeker is the uncanny of Linirea's armed forces! His sword swings with class and elegance, his armor shines like the sun itself, his cape shakes with pure hope, ladies faint at the sight of his presence."
"If there's good, he will find it... if there's evil, he will crush it... if there's light, he will seek it!"
"Three hoorays and a mug of light beer for Gerald Lightseeker, hero of Linirea!"
Skills.
Courage 
 Learnt at Level 2. Gerald Lightseeker will strengthen units in an AoE around him (requires at least two allies that are engaging melee combat near him). Affected Units will emit a blue aura below their feet. This skill has a duration of 6 seconds. (Cooldown: 8 seconds)
Shield of Retribution 
 Learnt at level 4. Once used, Gerald Lightseeker will reflect enemy damage to the source, dealing [True%20Damage](True Damage). It can't be used against enemies with an area attack ability (except [Cerberus](Cerberus) and [Lord%20Blackburn](Lord Blackburn)), which include the [Yeti](Yeti), [Magma%20Elemental](Magma Elemental), [Forest%20Troll](Forest Troll), [Troll%20Breaker](Troll Breaker), [Swamp%20Thing](Swamp Thing) and most [Bosses](Bosses). Ranged attacks or a demon's infernal combustion also cannot be blocked. The rate of triggering this skill increases as Gerald's level increases. At Level 10, this skill greatly enhances Gerald's durability and allows him to kill enemies with high armor or even [Spectral%20Knight](physical damage immunity). On flash, it is bugged that the Shield of Retribution reflects no damage while Gerald himself receives no damage from enemies either.
Tips and Tricks.
Gerald is a physical melee hero specializing on singlehandedly taking out tanky enemies with true damage whilst supporting his chokepoint with Inspire, which means he could not attack flying enemies. Do not send Gerald towards a lane that has mostly flying enemies on it.
Keep in mind melee heroes are vulnerable to ranged enemies, so get reinforcements or your own units to deter that threat. Moving Gerald to the ranged unit will also work.
Gerald works great at defending, and he has great potential for tanking and controlling a path of enemies by himself. Do not hesitate to bring him alongside [Call%20Reinforcements](reinforcements) to face tanky enemies or a horde of weaker enemies.
Retreat only when the waves get harder or the lane(s) where you sent Gerald starts to get overwhelmed. Better to retreat back to where your units are stationed to give him a chance to see another wave.
Against [enemies](enemies) with a high, non-area attack (such as [Dark%20Slayer](Dark Slayer)s, [Son%20of%20Sarelgaz](Sons of Sarelgaz), [Fallen%20Knights](Fallen Knights), [Lycan](Lycan)s etc.), Shield of Retribution can be used to great effect. Furthermore, it deals [True%20Damage](True Damage), making it perfect against heavily armored enemies like Dark Slayers, [Raider](Raider)s and [Spectral%20Knight](Spectral Knight)s. At level 10, Gerald can even kill [Gul%27Thak](Gul'Thak) and [Myconid](Myconid) quite easily, as they lack an area attack.
Raising Gerald to Level 7 should always be a priority, as his Shield of Retribution will proc more often, leading to a larger dose of experience that can get him to level 10 quicker than other heroes. Try to proc Gerald's Courage skill and prioritize foes with no physical defenses for more experience gain.
Do note however, that Gerald cannot proc Shield of Retribution on foes that deal Area Attacks.
Against bosses without instant-kill mechanisms, such as [Gul%27Thak](Gul'Thak),[The%20Juggernaut](The Juggernaut),[Myconid](Myconid),[Ulguk-Hai](Ulguk-Hai); Gerald could easily tank their attacks, allowing extra delay time. However, retreat as soon as possible to prevent the boss from dealing killing Gerald. Using [Call%20Reinforcements](reinforcements) and/or making use of soldiers would significantly delay the boss from reaching its goal, allowing towers to deal significant damage to the boss.
Against [bosses](bosses) with instant-kill mechanisms, such as [J.T.](J.T.), [Sarelgaz](Sarelgaz), or [Vez%27nan](Vez'nan); sending Gerald against the boss would be a pointless move resulting in his immediate death, worsening the situation. Send him to defend your final choke points instead, fending off enemies while your towers deal with the boss.
Be wary of bosses with instant-kill abilities or disrupting abilities, such as [Moloch](Moloch) and [Lord%20Blackburn](Lord Blackburn). Take note of their animations when they utilize their abilities and move Gerald out of the way.

Gerald Lightseeker is the third boss in , fought in [Lightseeker%20Camp](Lightseeker Camp). Previously a in [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush), he returns to fight against [Vez%27nan](Vez'nan).
## Overview

At the start of the stage, Gerald is confident that his men can defeat [Vez%27nan](Vez'nan's) forces, so he chooses to sunbathe on the top of his barracks while being served by a valet. If the player can slaughter enough of his men and survive to wave 15, he (finally) decides to fight, descends through the barracks and emerges fully armored and ready for battle.
As the fight takes place in the penultimate stage, Gerald is a fairly simple boss. He heals himself by 100 and 300 when the health is below 50% and 25% respectively. But, when having enough troops around him, Gerald activates his Courage ability which gives his men +80% armor over a few seconds. When defeated, he'll be imprisoned by [Vez%27nan](Vez'nan's) Magic Shackles spell.
Returning to [Lightseeker%20Camp](Lightseeker Camp) on [Heroic%20Challenge](Heroic Challenge) or [Iron%20Challenge](Iron Challenge) find [Goblin](Goblin)s have taken over the barracks; throwing the shield to the ground and decorating it with party banners; and are enjoying BBQ and drinks with the valet.

Appearances.
Sir Gerald Lightseeker, mighty paladin from Linirea, uses his holy powers once again to protect these lands from a recent unknown menace. 
Gerald Lightseeker is the first Legend in [Legends%20of%20Kingdom%20Rush](Legends of Kingdom Rush). He is the player's starting Hero and is introduced at the beginning of the game. 
Story.
Gerald is heavily chained and locked in one of the castle's dungeons on Vez'nan's orders. Asra Daggerfall appears and quickly unlocks his chains, leaving a leather bag filled with weaponry. Gerald asks who she is and what is going on, but she says there isn't enough time to explain, and swiftly exits the dungeon wishing him goodluck. 
As he gears up, he looks out of his cell and notices there is only one guard assigned to his watch. He smirks, remarking that they will regret making it easy for him to escape. The tutorial begins, and the game instructs the player on the combat mechanics and directs the player to slay the guard. Gerald leaves the dungeon and advances around the castle, and the player is introduced to the first story choice of the game. Gerald sees a captured Ranger in a cell. With his strength Gerald managed to free the Ranger from the cell, and then the two wanders out the citadel. As they travel more, they met a Wizard who is bored of Vez'nan's dynasty. Together, the trio fight the guards and managed to escape the army clutches, just for another adventure awaits them outside...
