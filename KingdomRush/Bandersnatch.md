# Bandersnatch

Bandersnatches are giant, porcupine-like creatures that roll quickly when they wrap themselves into a ball and are enemies in the Faery Forest.
## Overview

“"Ferocious and extraordinarily fast, this frumious beast is rarely seen but always feared.”"
Bandersnatches cannot be slowed while rolling along the path. When blocked, they unroll and release small area attacks at soldiers. Once after every 3 basic attacks, they roll into a tight ball, causing all of the sharp spines to point outwards and dealing 140-200 physical damage in a large area.
Strategy.
Even high-level [Call%20Reinforcements](reinforcements) and barracks soldiers can barely hold Bandersnatches for a few seconds. Armored such as [Eridan](Eridan) or [Lynn](Lynn) can block them for a considerable time but need support from towers to defeat them. Plus, it is best to counter them with [instant%20kill](instant kill)s such as [Golden%20Longbows](Crimson Sentence) or [Wild%20Magus](Eldritch Doom). [Reg%27son](Vindicator) is also useful, but in later waves, Bandersnatches tend to come in small groups, so the spell's cooldown renders it ineffective.
On Impossible difficulty, they gain massive amounts of health, making them much more difficult to kill relative to other enemies. The player either has to have multiple barracks to hold them, or invest in instant kills.
