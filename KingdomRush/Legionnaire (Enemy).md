## Overview

"Hardened by lengthy battles throughout the desert, the soldiers of Hammerhold are ready to die for their motherland.."
Strategy.
As Hammerhold's basic foot soldiers, they are quite a respectable force to be reckoned with, having plenty of health, damage, speed, and commonly appearing in large numbers, making them far more effective than common Linirean soldiers. While any combination of towers should handle them since they have no resistance of any kind, it will take relatively high tower investments to keep them at bay because of their high stats and because they are usually backed up by even stronger Hammerhold warriors like Legion Archers and Falconers. They can also spawn from [Legionnaire%20Hall](Legionnaire Halls) and dismount from [Camel%20Rider](Camels) to continue the fight.
