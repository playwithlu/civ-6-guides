# Blazing Gem

The Blazing Gem is a premium in , and costs $4.99. It focuses an intense laser beam onto an enemy that deals more damage the longer it's locked on a single enemy.
Description.
"Fueled by the dark magic of Vez'nan's acolytes, The Obelisk's power increases the longer it locks onto a target, able to roast the toughest of enemies in a few seconds."
For every 1.25 seconds spent locked onto an enemy, the Blazing Gem's damage increases, to 2x the listed value and then 3x (4x with Gem of Amplification). There‘s no limit to the damage this tower can do.
Unlike other towers, the Blazing Gem does not automatically aim at the enemy within range that is nearest to the exits; instead, it targets the enemy that is "farthest" from the exit, and will only switch targets when the current one dies or moves out of range. It has a 1.5 second cooldown between lock-ons. 
This tower functions similarly to the [Wild%20Magus](Wild Magus) from Origins as it is a magic tower that increases damage the longer it holds onto an enemy, and with both Destructo-Ray and Unstable Power it also gains a similar functionality to Eldritch Doom by killing an enemy and damaging those around it. However, it is much worse against hordes of weaker enemies.
The Destructo-Ray is also similar to the [Arcane%20Wizard](Arcane Wizard's) Death Ray, with its ability to [instant%20kill](instant kill) any units, leaving behind nothing but black dust.
Abilities.
Gem of Amplification.
 "Just a little more POWER"
Allows the Blazing Gem to reach a 4th level of charge, multiplying the listed damage by 4. Signified by the gem turning violet in color.

 "Begone!"
Fires a ray that an enemy.
Unstable Power.
 "This will blow your mind"
Every enemy killed by the Blazing Gem explodes, dealing magic damage in a small area (Damage Area: 100).
Strategy.
The Blazing Gem is excellent at killing high HP or high physical defense enemies. Gem of Amplification makes it even easier to take down tanks and bosses, and Destructo-Ray is good at getting rid of tanky threats in a snap of a finger. Despite the Blazing Gem being an amazing tank killer, it has a couple major flaws. One flaw is the fact the tower doesn‘t have good range, making it easy for tanks to get away. However, this problem is solved by using barrack towers like [Dark%20Knights](Dark Knights) or [Orc%20Warriors%20Den](Orcs). Also, the Blazing Gem has awful crowd control, as it targets the enemy furthest from the exit and deals initially weak damage. Unstable Power isn’t useful against higher health units later on, so artillery should be used instead to provide crowd control. However, Unstable Power is good at weakening enemies, making it easy for [Shadow%20Archers](Shadow Archers) or [Elite%20Harassers](Elite Harassers) to finish them.
