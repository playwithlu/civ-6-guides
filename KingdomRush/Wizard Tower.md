# Wizard Tower

The Wizard Tower is the Level 3 form of the basic [Mages%20Guild](Mage tower). Having surpassed most of their fellow mages, wizards are capable of ripping apart the very essence of enemy troops. Obviously, armor won't stand a chance against such magic. The tower is the same in both [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush) and , with only a change in appearance.
Description.
"Wizards cast high-energy bolts, which rip apart the very essence of enemy troops."
High energy bolts enable the wizards to obliterate all but the toughest enemies conjured by the forces of evil. Even flying enemies aren't safe. The wizards are the final stage of the unspecialized towers, only one step away from becoming a powerful [Arcane%20Wizard](Arcane Wizard) (enabled at [The%20Citadel](Stage 6)) or a sly [Sorcerer%20Mage](Sorcerer Mage) (enabled at [Stormcloud%20Temple](Stage 9)).
Be wary that although the damage of Wizards is the highest of all level 3 towers, magic resistant enemies will not be hurt much by magical attacks and require a different approach by [Archer%20Tower](arrow) or [Dwarven%20Bombard](explosive).
