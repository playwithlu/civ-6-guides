 "[Dwarf%20Hall](The Dwarves) are one of our staunchest allies, and our [King%20Denas](King) has named them 'Guardians of the Caves'. In their quest for the Lost Kingdom of Loria, they have stumbled upon a network of secret Saurian tunnels."
 "Through them an enormous horde of Saurians is heading for the surface, bent on conquering Linirea under the taloned foot of [Xyzzy](Xyzzy) , the Saurian King. You must join the Dwarves in stopping Xyzzy and his beasts... for only Denas can be King of Linirea!"
