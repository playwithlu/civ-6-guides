# River Trail

The River Trail is a feature of the [Waterfalls%20Trail](Waterfalls Trail).
Description.
Flowing from the top left of the map, through the middle of the level, down a waterfall and off to the bottom right, the River Trail offers very little to the level. Â However, items will regularly fall down the first waterfall and tapping on them has different outcomes.
There is only a short time to click the items. When they reach the level's central waterfall they will tip over the edge and disappear.
