Tips and Tricks.
## Overview

Cronan is a moderately durable melee fighter specialized in crowd control, and dealing with individually weak but numerous enemies. He deals a noticeable amount of damage and has decent health, although lacking in armor. His abilities center him around stalling multiple enemies at once (but weaker than [Alric](Alric) at the job), but he should not be depended on to deal a lot of damage, so he is best put near choke points where he can keep enemies stalled and towers help him do the killing.
It is recommended to take note of Stampede's cooldown so you can micromanage Cronan to make the best use of his lane area stun against numerous enemies. A well timed Stampede could destroy the momentum of the invading lane and leave foes under the mercy of your towers and units.
Cronan can readily form his own chokepoints or reinforce chokepoints through Boarmaster by his barracks or the [Necromancer%20Tower](Necromancer Tower). As such, Cronan excels in holding more enemies whilst waiting for Stampede to be ready.
Although Deep Lashes does very little true damage, it can be used to great effect by levelling Cronan quicker, or to soften a tanky unit via hit and run tactics. Falconer similarly acts as a source of secondary damage to offset Cronan's lack of noticable damage for as long as Cronan is alive.
Regeneration serves as a nice middle ground for Cronan to fall back on whilst levelling. This allows Cronan to shorten his duration needed to heal, which is helpful for recovering the heart of Cronan's chokepoint capability.
