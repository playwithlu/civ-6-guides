= Tales from the Crypt =
We venture into an ancient mausoleum and discover a strange-looking book resting on a stone pedastal.
It radiates such an empowering energy that, just standing nearby, we feel tempted to read from it.
Options.
Read it..
We started reciting the writings out loud in unison, and we felt a strange energy flowing through us.
Entranced, we didn't notice the many undead enemies surrounding us until it was too late!
Put it down..
Requires: [Reg%27son](Reg'son) (auto-success)
We managed to put the book down, and we resisted the temptation to read it.
We may be depriving ourselves of a great power, but messing with it didn't feel wise at all.
Destroy it!
We unwillingly started to read from the book but, in a surge of willpower, we decided to destroy it to avoid reading any further.
A haunting moan echoed through the building.
