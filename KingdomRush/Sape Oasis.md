# Sape Oasis

 "Our armies have amassed under your command, as we pursue Lord Malagar across the Azsare desert!"
 "We have followed his trail to the Sape Oasis, one of the few green spots in this wasteland. As such, the nomad tribes do not take kindly to trespassers, so don't provoke the desert's fiercest denizens, the Duskar!"
Sape Oasis is the third level of . The stage has two entry points in north and east and only one exit in west. Level 3 towers are unlocked at this stage.
At the peak of the mountain, we can see 2 nomad tribes who will shoot at any single unit that is on a melee combat for a moment. Each shot deals 100-200 physical damage, with a cooldown of 20s. It can target an ally or enemy unit, so be careful.
