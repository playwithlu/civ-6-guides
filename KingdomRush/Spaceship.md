# Spaceship

 
The crashed spaceship makes an appearance in the [Lost%20Jungle](Lost Jungle), half buried in the soil of the jungle and surrounded by almost a dozen egg pods of extra-terrestrial origin. The ship is presumably the origin of the eggs.
Description.
The spaceship has apparently been in the jungle for quite some time, as it is partly overgrown by vines and even appears on the world map.
The ship itself does nothing, but the eggs on the ground around it will eventually hatch into deadly [Parasyte](Parasyte)s. Eggs begin hatching from the start of Wave 5, spawning Parasytes onto the northern path, and will hatch again every 15 seconds, with more Parasytes each time, appearing onto both paths. Waves 12 and 13 are a brief period where they only hatch every 30 seconds, but the 15 second intervals return in Wave 14, when six Parasytes will hatch onto each path at once.
Parasytes hatched from eggs do not give [Gold](Gold).
