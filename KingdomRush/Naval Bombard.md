# Naval Bombard

"A powerful cannon made by the Dark Armada, capable of reducing the most powerful enemy towers to rubble. Boombastic!"
## Overview

A huge cannon, not unlike a Dwarven Bombard sits on the deck of Vez'nan's lead ship. The cannon can target any enemy towers occupying the path, and for a hefty price blow them up. A destroyed enemy tower leaves a new useable Strategic Point in its place.
