# Blacksurge

Blacksurges are heavily armored Deep Devil spellcasters, encountered during the Rising Tides mini-[campaign](campaign).
## Overview

"These armored abyssal devils wield ancient magics from the ocean's depths."
Blacksurges are one of the nastiest and most annoying enemies encountered in all the Kingdom Rush games. Like [Nazeru](Nazeru), they possess a tower-disabling ability (cooldown 5.0s, duration: 7.5s), which cannot be dispelled and is used faster than the effect wears off, allowing up to four nearby towers to be disabled at once. This ability might quickly topple your defenses and allow other enemies to cross unscathed.
On land, Blacksurges also possess the ability to retreat into their shells if their health drops below 30% (252 / 288 / 360) of their full health, becoming temporarily immune to all attacks except for some [instant%20kill](instant kill)s, and regenerating 540 health. To top it all off, Blacksurges already have high physical armor, and this ability substantially boosts their durability, making them extremely hard to kill. Blacksurges cannot use this ability near to an exit or on the sea.
