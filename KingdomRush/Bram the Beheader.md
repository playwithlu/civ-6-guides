# Bram the Beheader

Bram the Beheader is the boss of the mini-[campaign](campaign) Hulking Rage in .
## Overview

"The brutal leader of the Ogres. He likes to chop heads to get things done."
Bram sits on his throne of skulls in the [Beheader%27s%20Seat](Beheader's Seat). He only has one head remaining, the other apparently having been chopped off and is now mounted on a pike near his brother's throne. Similar to many other villains in the series, Bram has a full repertoire of jarring taunts that he uses to unnerve his foes. After wave 15, Bram walks down from the throne towards the middle exit. His path is extremely short (even shorter than [The%20Kingpin](The Kingpin's) or [Moloch](Moloch's)), but he doesn't have too much HP to compensate for it. He, however, possesses an [instant%20kill](instant kill) attack (that Heroes are immune to) in which he literally smacks soldiers one-by-one out of the map at the rate of 0.8 seconds (1.5 seconds on Steam). He can also transform Gnolls into [Blood%20Gnoll](Blood Gnoll)s in the same manner as his [Blood%20Ogre](Blood Ogre) minions. Upon his defeat, the [Bloodsydian](Bloodsydian) in his arms crystallize his entire body and it immediately crumbles to pieces. On Steam, he also groans in defeat.
When [Beheader%27s%20Seat](Beheader's Seat) is played on [Heroic%20Challenge](Heroic Challenge) or [Iron%20Challenge](Iron Challenge) modes, after his defeat, the Beheader was beheaded and his head is now mounted on a pike directly in front of his throne. He is apparently still alive, though, and now directs his insults not just at the player, the General, but also to his brother's head (who appears to be alive as well, and doesn't pay much attention to Bram trash talking him).
