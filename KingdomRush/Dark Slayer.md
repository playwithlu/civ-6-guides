# Dark Slayer

Dark Slayers are stronger versions of the [Dark%20Knight](Dark Knight), with the highest physical armor of any enemy (tied with [Raider](Raider)s and [Bloodshell](Bloodshell)s) in [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush) and .
Appearance.
Dark Slayers are humongous knights in a full suit of dark armor. Their helmets have a pair of horns and a thin black visor, obscuring their faces. Dark Slayers appear to have several spikes covering their shoulders. They wield a giant serrated sword with a red hilt.
## Overview

"Claimed by darkness; slayers are the bane of anyone standing in their way."
Dark Slayers are virtually impervious to physical attacks; other than the [Musketeer%20Garrison](Musketeer's) Sniper Shot, "nothing" does more than scratch this hulking monstrosity. Non-upgraded Archer towers will deal little to no damage. The normal strikes of a [Holy%20Order](Paladin) are very weak , and the [500mm%20Big%20Bertha](500mm Big Bertha), ignoring half the armor level, barely damages it. Even a fully upgraded [Rain%20of%20Fire](Rain of Fire) can't kill one. Barracks troops quickly fall to the Dark Slayer's powerful strikes. Use the highest level magic towers possible, and [Arcane%20Wizard](Death Rays) or the Dark Slayer shall surely live up to his name.
Dark Slayers almost always appear with many Dark Knights trailing behind them. Shadow Archers are also commonly seen with Dark Slayers.
