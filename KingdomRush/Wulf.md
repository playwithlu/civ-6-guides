# Wulf

&lt;tabber&gt;Kingdom Rush=
Wulves are among the fastest enemies in Kingdom Rush. Though they can dodge melee attacks, they are still very weak, and even a basic [Militia%20Barracks](Militia Barracks) soldier can stop them in their tracks. They are the cousin to the [Worg](Worg), [Winter%20Wolf](Winter Wolf), [Demon%20Hound](Demon Hound), [Sand%20Hound](Sand Hound), [War%20Hound](War Hound), [Hyena](Hyena), [Blood%20Servant](Blood Servant), [Devourer](Devourer), [Glacial%20Wolf](Glacial Wolf), [Watchdog](Watchdog) and [Corrosive%20Soul](Corrosive Soul).
## Overview

"Very fast vicious creatures that can dodge melee attacks."
Wulves generally mix in waves with tougher enemies, allowing them to slip through unprepared defenses. Often a single stray Wulf can mean the difference between victory or defeat in [Heroic%20Challenge](Heroic) or [Iron%20Challenge](Iron Challenge)s. However, near the end of each level (especially the later levels), Wulves have far too little health to have any chance of surviving your defenses, effectively turning them into money bags for the player to grab.
Wulves, when killed, are not reanimated in [Graveyard](Graveyard)s as they are canine enemies, not humanoids.
Their ability to dodge melee attacks makes even strong heroes like [Thor](Thor) struggle against them, and they will be able to deal some damage before they are killed.
Trivia.
A total of 1018 Wulves Appear throughout all of the levels in the game.
