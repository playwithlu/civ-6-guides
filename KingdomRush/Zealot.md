# Zealot

Zealots are special enemies that only appear in [Campaign](Campaign) mode of [The%20Unseelie%20Court](The Unseelie Court). They have no encyclopedia entry.
## Overview

Zealots do not spawn from the regular entrances, but from the archways at the eastern corners of the map. They appear in five waves, and Zealots appearing in later waves have more HP.
After a Zealot spawns, she'll walk towards the ritual circle in front of her. When a Zealot reaches her destination, she'll summon to the closest summoning circle, one of the following groups of enemies:
A second after finishing this ritual, the Zealot falls over, dead. Summoned enemies are identical to their regular counterparts, but give no gold when killed.
[Hero](Hero)es and [Call%20Reinforcements](Reinforcements) can be put on the Zealots' path to block them and prevent them from reaching the ritual circle, but if a Zealot reaches the circle and begins summoning, she cannot be interrupted and won't fight back if attacked. If Zealot is raggified (by [Razz%20and%20Rags](Razz and Rags)' ability) she won't reach the ritual circle, but enemies will be summoned anyway.
