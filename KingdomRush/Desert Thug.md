"These thugs are lowly mercenaries that enjoy pillaging."
Desert Thugs are the equivalent of [Goblin](Goblin)s from the original [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush): the weakest enemies in the game and by far the easiest to defeat.

They are so weak that even in numbers, they pose virtually no threat, except as meat shields against special abilities for other enemies.
