# The Grand Arena (DLC)

"In an unexpected twist, Malik has dared to challenge me to a showdown in the Hammerhold arena. An ancient tradition dictates that whoever wins the test of the desert will be crowned king of the city. Not that they have a choice, but this way I won't have to quell pesky rebellions."
The Grand Arena is the thirty-sixth level in and the fifth and final level in the Hammerhold DLC. Much like the final levels of each section of the main campaign and the final level of every other mini-campaign in this game, the Boss, Malik, taunts you from his throne.
