# Anurian Erudite

Anurian Erudite are ranine enemies. They are encountered in the Anurian Wetlands, the fourth [environment](environment) of , introduced in the Subaquatic Menace [Campaign](Mini-Campaign).
## Overview

"Great and wise, these Anurians need great reserves of magic and sap the power of their apprentices to cast powerful spells."
Huge orange frog-men on floating lilypads, these Anurians are infused with pink crystals and use them to cast spells. Like the [Archmage%20Tower](Archmage Tower) and the [Specters%20Mausoleum](Specters Mausoleum), they can store up to three bolts and unleash them on the first troop or hero they encounter for massive damage. Being a magical attack, no armor will protect against this assault. Their moderate HP and high magic resistance means that Mages will be relatively ineffective and Archers should be used instead.
If they are close to [Anurian%20Channeler](Anurian Channeler), their damage will be nearly doubled, allowing them to make very short work of troops and heroes and causing them to leak through fast.
