## Overview

"Skillful gunners. Able to deal with the most powerful menaces from an incredible distance with their top grade hunting rifles."
As Linirea's highly-trained marksmen, Musketeers are long range units that attack for high damage at a range and have an extremely long distance attack that deals incredible damage (Cooldown: 5 seconds). They can easily and quickly overwhelm barracks troops, goonies, and even heroes with relative ease, especially since they tend to appear in groups and hide behind more durable enemies like Footmen. Thankfully, they have weak melee damage, relatively low HP, no armor, and no magic resistance.
