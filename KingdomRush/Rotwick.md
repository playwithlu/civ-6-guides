# Rotwick

 "General, our Kingdom is in peril once again! King Banesti, of neighboring Niroma was on his way here for the "Great Tournament of the Kingdoms", but he was captured at Mournful Valley. His people would never forgive us if something happened to the elderly sovereign, it could lead to war between our two realms!"
 "The fastest route to the valley is, I'm afraid, the Royal Roadway, through the infamous Rotwick."
