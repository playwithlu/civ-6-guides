# Gnoll Blighter

Gnoll Blighters are Gnoll wizards wielding the powers of decay.
## Overview

"Defilers of nature that command forces of death and decay."
Gnoll Blighters are rare but powerful enemies capable of dishing out heavy damage, as well as soaking up quite a lot of hits thanks to their high HP and magic resistance.Â 
With their powers over death and decay, Gnoll Blighters can weave a spell capable of withering [Magic%20Blossom](Magic Blossom)s, preventing them from producing magic bolts. With a very short cooldown and decent duration, even a single Gnoll Blighter can effectively render all Magic Blossoms near him useless unless silenced by a [Wild%20Magus](Wild Magus) or [Faustus](Faustus).
