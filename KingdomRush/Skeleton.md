# Skeleton

&lt;tabber&gt;Kingdom Rush=
Skeletons are basic units that can only be spawned by [Graveyard](Graveyard)s, [Skeleton%20Pile](Skeleton Pile)s and [Necromancer](Necromancer)s, in the final case, give no gold when killed. They are spawned in [Graveyard](Graveyard)s when a humanoid enemy with less than 300 maximum health is slain (like [Shadow%20Archer](Shadow Archer)s or [Brigand](Brigand)s). Their stronger counterpart is the [Skeleton%20Knight](Skeleton Knight).
Skeletons reappear in , this time as a soldier summoned by the [Necromancer%20Tower](Necromancer Tower), spawned from the corpses of human-sized humanoid enemies, like [Savage%20Zombie](Savage Zombie)s or [Saurian%20Nightscale](Saurian Nightscale)s. However, they are weaker than a Level 1 with only 40 HP and 1-6 attack damage.
## Overview

"Mindless automatons that obey the orders of their evil masters."
These enemies, though weak, are doubly dangerous when in groups. When lots of enemies are being killed elsewhere, they can easily swarm past towers guarding their graveyards.
[Necromancer](Necromancer)s also spawn these, producing five at a time and occasionally with a [Skeleton%20Knight](Skeleton Knight), so be sure to take them down as fast as possible.
Skeletons are immune to poison from [Rangers%20Hideout](Rangers Hideout)s.
