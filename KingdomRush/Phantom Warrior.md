# Phantom Warrior

Phantom Warriors (Phantoms on mobile versions) are spectral warriors that appear in the Shadowmoon mini-[campaign](campaign) in .
## Overview

"Specters of ancient warriors... their cold presence snuffs the life out of the living."
Phantom Warriors can be treated as more powerful versions of [Ghost](Ghost)s, with much more health and the same ability to completely ignore all physical attacks. In addition to this, simply being in their vicinity deals damage to non-undead units: 1 damage per 0.1 second to [heroes](heroes), and 3 damage per 0.1 second to the others. [Militia%20Barracks](Militia Barracks) will die in moments, while other soldiers can last a bit longer, but of course that does not stop the Phantom Warrior from using his sword to cleave them out.
Being incorporeal creatures, Phantom Warriors are immune to [Rain%20of%20Fire](Scorched Earth) (they only take damage from the initial meteors) and do not leave corpses for [Necromancer%20Tower](Necromancer Tower)s to use.
