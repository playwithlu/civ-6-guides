# Ghost

&lt;tabber&gt;Kingdom Rush: Frontiers=
Ghosts are lost souls wandering the southern Valardul Wastes that appear in the Shadowmoon mini-campaign in . They are one of the six enemies in the series that are completely immune to physical damage, the others being [Phantom%20Warrior](Phantom Warrior)s, [Spectral%20Knight](Spectral Knight)s, [Scourger%20Banshee](Scourger Banshee)s, Frozen Souls in the [Iron%20Challenge](Iron Challenge) of [Breaking%20the%20Ice](Breaking the Ice), and the purple [Ancient%20Ghost](Ancient Ghost).
## Overview

"Tortured spirits that roam the wastes, seeking release from their eternal suffering."
Ghosts have the unique ability to ignore soldiers and terrain - they might choose to follow the preset paths like other enemies, or just bypass them all together to reach the exits; either way, no soldier will be able to stop them. They are also completely immune to physical damage of any kind, making absolutely vital in stopping them - otherwise, they don't have much health and can be defeated without much difficulty unless if you've been neglecting magic towers, though beware of [Ghoul](Ghoul)s and other fast enemies that can distract mages from shooting at Ghosts.
Ghosts are the only enemies in the Shadowmoon mini-campaign that do not benefit from the full [Moon](Moon). Being incorporeal creatures, they also do not leave corpses for the [Necromancer%20Tower](Necromancer Tower) to use.

## Overview

"Tortured spirits that roam the wasteland, seeking their release from eternal suffering"
Like their Kingdom Rush: Frontiers counterparts, ghosts cannot be blocked. However, they are not immune to physical damage, instead having maximum physical armor. Due to the way artillery works in Vengeance, 50%-75% of the Ghost's armor will be ignored by certain artillery towers.
Furthermore, they are immune to all modifiers, such as slows, stuns, or most damage over time effects. For instance, the Wicked Sister's poison attack or Beresad's Hellfire will not affect Ghosts due to this clause.
