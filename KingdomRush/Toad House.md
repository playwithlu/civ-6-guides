# Toad House

The Toad House is a seemingly possessed house in the [City%20of%20Lozagon](City of Lozagon). It appears only in the [Campaign](Campaign) mode of the level. The house is missing in the [Iron%20Challenge](Iron Challenge) and [Heroic%20Challenge](Heroic Challenge), suggesting it was a creature created by [Magnus%20Spellbane](Magnus Spellbane) - who is also absent in these challenges.
Description.
It resides in the top right corner of the map near the exit. Before the stage starts, it looks as if it is sleeping. When the stage starts, it wakes up and looks around suspiciously with its one eye.
Like the [Snapvine](Snapvine)s of it appears to be idle until there are units in front of it. If 2 or more units are standing in front of it, the house sticks out a long ball tongue and swallows 2 of them (cooldown: 5 seconds). It cannot swallow heroes. 
Strategy.
The Toad House can't be immobilized or killed. Keeping units outside its range (70), or not building barracks near it at all is therefore advised.
