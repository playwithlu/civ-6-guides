# Parasyte

Parasytes are mysterious aliens inhabiting the jungle stages in . They appear to have come to the planet by the crashed spaceship in the [Lost%20Jungle](Lost Jungle).
## Overview

"These creatures lay eggs inside their victims, which later spawn horrible monsters."
Parasytes do not spawn from entrances (except in the [Iron%20Challenge](Iron Challenge) and the [Temple%20of%20Evil](Temple of Evil)), but from violet egg sacs. They are one of the most annoying enemies in the entire game. They crawl up a soldier and secure their eight finger-like appendages tightly around the victim's head. When the host dies from their attack, they turn to [Reaper](Reaper)s and emerge forcibly from the host's body. Their 'attack' renders a soldier useless and pretty much kills your defenses as a face-hugged soldier isn't considered dead yet and thus will not respawn. Worse still, they will be periodically spawned in groups during later waves, and worst of all, don't give any gold when get killed.
