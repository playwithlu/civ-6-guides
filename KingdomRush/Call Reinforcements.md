# Call Reinforcements

Call Reinforcements is the first of the major spells in [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush), , , . When used, it spawns two soldiers that last for a certain period of time. Reinforcements act the same as troops summoned by any kind of , buying time by engaging non-flying enemies. It has a quick recharge rate of 10 seconds, so there is little sense keeping the spell charged: the more reinforcements on the battlefield, the more enemies are distracted. Reinforcements are useful as a replacement (albeit temporary) for Barracks, sealing choke points, or holding back enemies straying too close to the exit. With their ranged attack upgraded, they can take on small number of flying enemies somewhat effectively.
In , this spell is renamed Call Demon Goonies, but remains largely the same in function and usage.

Stats.
Initially, the spell summons two basic Farmers that last 20 seconds, but with upgrades they can become very powerful, able to kill weaker enemies. Their ranged attack, Throwing Spears, is very strong, able to take out hordes of annoying [Gargoyle](Gargoyle)s.

Stats.
Reinforcements have improved HP, armor and damage compared to those of the previous two games. They also gain their ranged attack, the Elven Stars, earlier, at tier 2 star upgrade on the Reinforcements upgrade tree. However, the ranged attack is weakened by a slower attack rate (1.6 seconds). Also, the recharge period of the spell is increased to 15 seconds instead of 10 seconds, until tier 4 upgrade, "Rapid Response", is reached. The healing when idle is always 15 HP per second; the tier upgrades do not change the HP/s recovered.

Stats.
Reinforcements are called Demon Goonies. Their upgrade tree is notable for having two mutually-exclusive upgrades at level 3: the Demon Guards, which are tougher, and the Hellion Tridents, which have a ranged attack; each of these branches also has its own level 4 upgrade. The final upgrade in the tree is the same for both branches and does not increase reinforcements' stats; it instead gives a 30% chance for a powerful Pit Lord to be spawned alongside the two Demon Guards or Hellion Tridents when the spell is used.
