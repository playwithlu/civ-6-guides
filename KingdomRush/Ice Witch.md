# Ice Witch

Ice Witch is an enemy found in , first encountered in [Frozen%20Rapids](Frozen Rapids).
## Overview

"Powerful witches able to create life from ice. There's no enemy they can't freeze."
Ice witches are enemies that use ranged magic attacks with 50% chance to freeze heroes and soldiers for 1 second, and can spawn an [Apex%20Shard](Apex Shard) every 8 second if not blocked. Their freezing capability allows them to quickly clear the path for other troops, and their shard spawning creates more trouble by making a fast but weak magic resistant enemy.
Most notably, they give a rather absurd bounty of 50 gold for a 250 HP enemy, which gives even more incentive to remove them fast.
