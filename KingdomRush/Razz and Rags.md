Description.
Ever wondered what might happen when you push a little guy to the limit? Here is your answer. As the peaceful gnomes got trampled, their homes destroyed and their lands ruined by Twilight Elves, Ogres and Gnolls... one little guy decided that enough was enough, so he built a big guy to help him out. The result is the meanest tag team in the Kingdom Rush Hero roster.

Tips and Tricks.
Razz and Rags are a physical hybrid harassing hero that excels in creating chaos within the enemy waves by themselves. They are excellent in dealing with swarms of enemies. Their Kamihares can instantly clear a group of Gnolls and damage even tanky enemies considerably, while their Hammer Time ability can stun enemies around them, stalling them for enough time to dish out extra damage. Changling, their Hero Spell, if timed and placed correctly, can create an army of Ragdolls (up to eight at a time) that serve as temporary meat shields for other incoming enemies, clumping them together in disorder. A major disadvantage of Razz and Rags, however, is that their movement speed is extremely slow, comparable to that of an [Earth%20Elemental](Earth Elemental), so one must prepare in advance their next moves to better utilize Razz and Rags. Although the pair fall short in terms of damage despite the area effect that Rags possesses and Razz having a quick firing speed, with careful and precise micromanagement, Razz and Rags are capable of sowing anarchy within enemy troops, clumping them together for a well positioned and timed Hammer Time.
