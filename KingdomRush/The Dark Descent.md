# The Dark Descent

 "We've almost run out of supplies, morale is at an all-time low, and some of our men have deserted. Luckily, we've bumped into a Dwarven mining crew that dug too deep and have barricaded themselves against the Saurians. "
 "They've promised to join us in finding our way out of this damned place. Our escape must wait, as we and our newfound allies must repel the oncoming Saurian horde!"
The Dark Descent is the 14th level ofÂ . The secondary hero [Rurin%20Longbeard](Rurin Longbeard) appears in this stage. There are two different paths with two different exits. While the tower doesn't affect the other paths much, heroes can still walk between the two paths using the bridge in between, teleportation, or flying.
