The beam can be activated by selecting the tower or pressing 4 on your keyboard (Flash only), then select the appropriate unit.
It has a similar function to the [Shrine%20of%20Regnos](Shrine of Regnos) introduced at a much later date in ; however, the Sunray Tower deals single-target damage, while the [Shrine%20of%20Regnos](Shrine of Regnos) deals damage in an area.
The Sunray Tower was previously unavailable in the iOS, Android and Steam versions, and was seen destroyed on the map. It was later re-added to the game.
## Overview

It is a tower that charges the sun rays via Sunray Sorcerers, and then retains that energy until it is needed to fire.
When used, it will instantly fire at a single enemy, dealing [True%20Damage](True damage) (possibly magic on Flash). The damage depends on the number of Sunray Sorcerers present. Each sorcerer costs 100 [Gold](Gold) to recruit; and in addition to that, recruiting a Sorcerer will instantly recharge the tower. The tower cannot target empty spaces.
