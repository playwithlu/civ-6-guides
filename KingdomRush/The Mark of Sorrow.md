# The Mark of Sorrow

The Mark of Sorrow is a mystery node in the game [Legends%20of%20Kingdom%20Rush](Legends of Kingdom Rush) in the map [Extradimensional%20Menace](Extradimensional Menace).
We come across some kind of monolith that looks like it belongs to the cult, but is very different from the other artefacts we've seen up until now.
It has a glowing, colour-shifting symbol and some kind of head-sized hole in the middle.

Touch it!
One of us dared to touch the monolith, which made its symbol glow in a blue colour and completely shut off afterwards.
Despite being damaged by the energy, our partner felt stronger than before.
"or"
One of us dared to touch the monolith, which made its symbol glow in a green colour and completely shut off afterwards.
After passing out for a while, our partner felt healthier than before.
Insert the mask.
Requires: Mask of Sorrow, from a Cultist Priest combat encounter with long stairs 
Noticing that our mask could fit in the hole, we decided to give it a try.
We heard a dry click behind the mask, and then the monolith's symbol started to frantically change colours and irradiate an empowering energy.
Move on.
Not knowing the outcomes of interacting with the monolith, we decided not to risk it, and we resumed our journey.
