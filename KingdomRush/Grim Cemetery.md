# Grim Cemetery

The Grim Cemetery is a premium in , costing $2.99. Instead of training units, it spawns uncontrollable zombies around it, either by itself or from the corpses of humanoid enemies.
Description.
"A dangerous cemetery full of zombies hungry for brains."
"Enemies unfortunate enough to die close to this cemetery will be denied their rest and forced to rise as mindless zombies, wandering about and attacking foes until they rot or get destroyed."
Grim Cemetery can hold up to 5 Zombies at a time. Though they do not heal even when idle, any hit points lost will be replenished when the tower is upgraded. Enemies with 500 or more HP are raised into sturdier Zombies, with 30% more HP.

Strategy.
The Grim Cemetery is a Melee Tower specialized in crowd control. Its large spawn cap of 5 zombies, and the way it replenishes troops, makes it ideal against many weak enemies, while its Tier 4 upgrades improve the tower's ability to hold back enemies and damage swarms of foes.
The tower's method of spawning troops (replenishing from enemy casualties) means that, in a choke point or other active area, new zombies will be spawned as quickly as existing zombies are killed. This means that the tower is far less intensive to use than other Melee Towers, since no care must be taken to keep the zombies alive. On the other hand, placing the tower in an area with few enemies is a bad idea. Since you can't direct the zombies around, any stragglers that the tower spawns far away from combat are essentially useless, and can't be removed. Ideally, one should place the tower as a group of weak enemies are passing by; then, use an Ability to kill the troops. A full set of 5 zombies should spawn right where you need them.
The tower's Tier 4 upgrades further improve its ability to replenish zombies and hold the line. ZombieX Muscle-Gain should be the first priority, since it's cheap, requires no further upgrades, and gives your zombies 25% more health to add to their already large health pool. This allows the zombies to fight longer, live longer, and absorb more damage. Bloated Corpses is the second priority for choosing an upgrade. The explosions, and the resultant poison, deal armor-piercing AOE magic damage, making it great against swarms of weak armored troops such as Footmen or Warhammer Guards. In addition, since zombies will likely be killed many times over the course of a battle, the ability will activate many times. Cold Grip is a negligible ability. While the slow it offers does affect a wide area and is substantial, it is no help in killing enemies, and should thus be purchased last.
The main weaknesses of the Grim Cemetery are high-damage ranged foes and miniboss enemies. Enemies such as the Musketeer or Ice Witch can cut through zombies at range, possibly leading to them spawning in a poor place. Enemies such as the High Sorcerer, though rarely a threat, can sometimes punch through the zombies if not killed quickly, as the zombies lack any armor or abilities that could help them in a 1v1 against a powerful enemy.
