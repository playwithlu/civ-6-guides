# Winter Wolf

&lt;tabber&gt;Kingdom Rush=
Winter WolvesÂ are swift foes, like their cousins the [Wulf](Wulf), [Worg](Worg) and [Demon%20Hound](Demon Hound). They have moderate resistance to magic attacks but are still relatively durable against everything else.
Description.
"Cunning &amp; deadly, these beasts can defeat all but the best warriors."
They are similar in looks to their relatives: [Wulf](Wulves), [Worg](Worg)s, and [Demon%20Hound](Demon Hound)s. However, you can clearly see they are adapted to cold, with sleek white fur, and are much deadlier than a Wulf or even a Worg, possessing decent resistance against magic and enhanced stats.
Winter Wolves are particularly dangerous because their health is higher than an average Worg, and allows them to slip through even the most carefully-planned defenses. work well, but because these beasts can dodge melee attacks, soldiers shouldn't be expected to deal much damage. Support is crucial.
