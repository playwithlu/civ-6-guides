# Demon Hound

&lt;tabber&gt;Kingdom Rush=
Demon Hounds are infernal dogs that move quickly and explode upon death (like [Demon%20Spawn](Demon Spawn) and [Demon%20Lord](Demon Lord)s), damaging nearby soldiers.
## Overview

"Vicious terrible creatures, they serve as hunting dogs for the demon lords."
These nasty beasts are annoying to deal with. Their magic resistance, infernal combustion, and fast speed allow them to pass through chokepoints with ease. In large numbers, they can be hard to stop.
