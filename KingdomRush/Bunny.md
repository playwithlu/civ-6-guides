# Bunny

Bunnies are special enemies that only appear in [the%20Unseelie%20Court](the Unseelie Court). They do not have an encyclopedia entry.
## Overview

Bunnies used to be regular enemies that were polymorphed by the mischievous gnomes that inhabit the [Gnome%20Garden](Gnome Garden). They are slow, weak and incapable of fighting, but are unblockable and give less gold than before their transformation.
Bunnies only spawn normally in [Iron%20Challenge](Iron Challenge) mode. They come in huge numbers, but since Druids are not disabled in this mode, they can easily be dealt with by a single [Arch-Druid%20Henge](Arch-Druid Henge) or [Weirdwood](Weirdwood).
