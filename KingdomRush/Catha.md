Tips and Tricks.
Catha is a physical ranged hero that excels in harassing foes and supporting chokepoints via healing your chokepoint. With her kit, Catha is a disruptive force of nature against hapless isolated foes, but can also be used to stump the momentum of foes battling chokepoints, while prolonging said chokepoint's survivability.
Catha, when fully leveled up, is excellent in dealing with large groups of enemies. Her four pixie warriors are all fast ranged attackers, can be healed by Catha's passive ability, and have the chance of putting enemies to sleep. In addition, her [Hero%20Spell](Hero Spell) can stun enemies for up to six seconds, giving her, her pixies, and nearby soldiers and towers a considerable amount of time to dish major damage.
