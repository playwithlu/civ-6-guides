Eiskalt, the most powerful son of [Jokull](Jokull), was born to rule in the North.
Life was a perpetual hunt and no one was better at this than him. His favorite prey were those feeble humans; It was so thrilling to play with them and end the chase in an instant with an icy breath or a twist of his powerful tail.
[Arkuz](Arkuz) and his own mother warned him several times against this, but he was having too much fun to listen to them and this, was his undoing. They trapped him under innumerable layers of ice, where he remained asleep until Vez'nan managed to set him free.
Now he will unleash his piercing cold rage against Vez'nan`s enemies and follow your command. With this hero on your hands, you will be unbeatable.

Tips and Tricks.
Eiskalt is a very powerful hero, if not the most powerful hero in "Vengeance", with both great damage and superior crowd control. His ability to constantly slow down enemies makes it far easier to manage enemy flow, and he is also capable of dishing out high aoe-damage. Unlike [Beresad](Beresad) and [Murglun](Murglun), Eiskalt has no ability to insta-kill an enemy, but more than makes up for this with his superior CC (basic attacks and Permafrost) and true area damage (basic attacks and Ice Peak).
While Eiskalt's ultimate ability does no damage, it is very powerful nonetheless (Doing the same thing as [Shop%23Chill%20Wand](an item that costs 250 gems) in [Kingdom%20Rush](previous) ), effectively stunning all enemies currently on the map, buying time to cull their numbers or for other abilities to come off cooldown.
However, while Eiskalt is capable of constantly slowing enemies down in large numbers, he cannot block them as he is flying. Also, like the other dragon heroes, he cannot attack enemies that are directly beneath him.
