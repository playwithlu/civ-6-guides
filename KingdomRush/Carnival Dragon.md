# Carnival Dragon

Carnival Dragons are enemies found in the Oriental Plains, the sixth environment of , introduced in the Rise of the Dragon Mini-Campaign.
## Overview

"A strange choice for a weapon... they confuse our troops by hiding in carnival dragons."
A strange yet goofy enemy, these recruits disguise themselves as Carnival Dragons in order to get past the enemy lines. They are unblockable, much like Ghosts and Frozen souls, and much like them, they're immune to all modifiers such as slows, stuns and most damage over time effects. However, they are not immune to physical damage unlike their ghostly counterparts so ranged towers prove to be effective against them.
There's usually two types of Carnival Dragons: the head and the body parts. The head has over double the health of the body part, takes two lives instead of one, and has more bounty compare to the body parts while the body parts appear in backlines and in greater numbers compare to the head. This pair of enemies with high health, immunity to being blocked, and numbers can often be very tricky to deal with.
Unlike Mogwais and Nians, they don't seem to be affected by water which you don't have to necessarely be worried about.
Strategy.
With all the parts lining out, spread damage or AOE towers with relatively good dps to handle these parts. The Goblin War Zeppelin and Rocket Riders have good area dps compared to the other two artilerry to handle lines of them, Boneflingers can spread its damage with Got Milk at max and Goblirangs at max can be very devastating at dealing with lines of them.
While they are unblockable by all barracks, Harrassers have a ranged attack and devastate a lone head with Arrow storm thanks to Carnival Dragons not being vunerable to all damage. Similairly, a level 4 Deep Devils Reef will give Redspines a ranged attack; however, this is not nearly as effective as the harrassers and Redspines do very little damage overall and are often very cost inefficient.
