# Orc Champion

&lt;tabber&gt;Kingdom Rush=
Orc Champions are heavily armored orcs and the most commonly encountered enemies in [Ruins%20of%20Acaroth](Ruins of Acaroth). There is a variation of the Orc Champion riding a [Worg](Worg), which is called the [Worg%20Rider](Worg Rider). Despite both Worgs and Orc Champions being in Legends of Kingdom Rush, Worg Riders don’t appear in that game, remaining exclusive to the original Kingdom Rush.
## Overview

"Orc champions are the elite fighting force of the goblinoid horde, equipped with heavy armor."
## Overview

These are the second strongest goblinoid melee units and the strongest orc melee units, and are usually only found only in the later stages of Krum'Thak's Dominion. However, on rare occasions, it’s possible to see one near the beginning. The only goblinoid melee unit stronger than the Orc Champion is the [Ogre](Ogre), but the Orc Champion’s effective HP against physical damage is higher than the health of the Ogre. This does not take into account magic attacks, which bypass armor, however.
