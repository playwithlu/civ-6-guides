# Bandit

Bandits are tricky enemies who hit hard and can dodge melee attacks.
## Overview

"Swift and agile, they can dispatch their enemies very quickly."
Bandits are versatile enemies, appearing in almost every stage of the game. While physically weak, they hit hard, and the massive amounts of damage they deal to soldiers means that they certainly live up to their in-game description. They mainly appear alongside [Brigand](Brigand)s or [Marauder](Marauders), so can be used effectively to finish off these ruffians.
