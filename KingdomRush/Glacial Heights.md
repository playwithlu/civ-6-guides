# Glacial Heights

 "Pack your winter gear, troops; we're heading for the Glacial Heights! The locals have reported some disturbances, and our King commands we march upon the heights to investigate these reports. Watch out, because the heights have become the icy tomb of many an unprepared explorer."
 "You might freeze to death, that is, if the savage Ha'Kraj trolls don't get you first!"
Glacial Heights is the nineteenth stage in [Kingdom%20Rush](Kingdom Rush) and the first stage in the Winter Storm mini-[campaign](campaign).
Trivia.
On the Flash version, the Heroic Challenge of Glacial Heights gives the player 5 lives instead of the usual 1. This is likely due to Troll Chieftains being able to affect Troll Breakers on that version.
