# Fort (Col)

A Fort is a substantial improvement over the [Stockade%20%28Col%29](stockade) and can be built when the population reaches 4 and already has a stockade in place. The stockade is reinforced with metal braces, artillery is installed to cover exposed approaches, and substantial defensive planning is evident. A fort overlooking the [Ocean%20%28Col%29](ocean) will slow the progress of foreign vessels and open fire on them if they venture too close.
