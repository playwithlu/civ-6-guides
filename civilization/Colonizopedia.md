# Colonizopedia

Colonizopedia is the in-game encyclopedia for "[Sid%20Meier%27s%20Colonization](Sid Meier's Colonization)" and "[FreeCol](FreeCol)". It is analogous to the [Civilopedia](Civilopedia) in most "[Civilization%20%28series%29](Civilization)" games.
Here stands all facts about things that ain't found in the manuals in a way to see them when you need them.
A place to see what buildings, units, tiles and other stuff do and how they work so you later can use them in the right way.
Observe that there's no maximum use of the Colonizopedia so use it as much as possible when you are unsure of things so you learn about the game.
