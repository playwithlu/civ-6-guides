Lines.
Isabella's lines use the historical "vos", an antecedent of "usted" (the formal "you," which is conjugated similarly to the modern "vosotros") that was often used in respectful titles (e.g. "Vuestra Merced", meaning "Your Lordship/Ladyship"). Although the singular "vos" is still used in parts of Latin America as an informal "you," the historical "vos" is no longer used outside of historical dramas and medieval/Renaissance literature, so Isabella's speech will sound almost Shakespearean to Spanish speakers.

Blessed Isabella, servant of God, holy queen of Castile and León! Your people greet and welcome you. You are the ruler of Spain, a beautiful and ancient country at the crossroads of the world between Europe and Africa, one shore on the Mediterranean and the other on the mighty Atlantic ocean.

Will you take up the mantle of the holy monarchy, and vanquish your foes under heaven’s watchful eyes? Your adoring subjects await your command!
