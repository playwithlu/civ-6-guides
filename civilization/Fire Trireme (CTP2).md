The fire trireme was one of the most destructive ships that ever sailed the Mediterranean. Its principle weapon was Greek fire, a combination of naphtha, sulfur, saltpeter, quicklime and petroleum developed by a Greek-speaking Syrian refugee in 650 AD. The Byzantine emperor Alexius I Comnenus burned down a Pisan fleet in the eleventh century with ships equipped with this volatile concoction that ignited upon impact with water. He ordered each of his ships set with a lion's head made of iron or bronze. Tubes fed through the lions' mouths into containers of Greek fire, giving the lions the appearance of spewing magnificent breaths of fire on the wooden ships of their enemies.
