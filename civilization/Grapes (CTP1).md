The drinking of wines has been a cherished pastime since the earliest days of ancient Greece. Over the centuries the craft of winemaking or "viticulture" has been refined to a science of precise control and an art form of exquisite detail. The essence of any fine wine is the grapes from which it is made. Most wines are made from a mixture of several different types of grape, blended to create a specific taste. The best wines, however, are created purely from the crop of one of the world's premier vineyards, where the richness of the soil passes its fabulous and unique qualities onto the grapes that grow there.
