# Anarchy (Civ5)

&lt;br&gt;
Anarchy happens when you unlock a [Social%20policies%20%28Civ5%29](policy tree) that is incompatible with another policy tree you have already unlocked. As a result of this change, the old policy tree will be rendered inactive, though you may activate it again (and thus re-enter Anarchy) at any time at no cost.
[Rationalism%20%28Civ5%29](Rationalism) is incompatible with [Piety%20%28Civ5%29](Piety), and [Freedom%20%28Civ5%29](Freedom), [Autocracy%20%28Civ5%29](Autocracy), and [Order%20%28Civ5%29](Order) are all incompatible with each other.
Anarchy lasts for one turn. During Anarchy you won't gain any (though you won't start losing  either) or , and in your cities will be halted.
In "" there are no more mutually exclusive social policy trees, and Anarchy happens instead when you're forced to change [Ideology%20%28Civ5%29](Ideologies), with the same effect.
Though you generally want to avoid Anarchy, it can sometimes be worthwhile if your priorities have changed or as part of a special strategy.
