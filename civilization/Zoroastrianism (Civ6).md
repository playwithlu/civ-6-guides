# Zoroastrianism (Civ6)

Zoroastrianism is one of the twelve default [Religion%20%28Civ6%29](religions) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". Players who have founded a [Pantheons%20%28Civ6%29](pantheon) can found Zoroastrianism by using a [Great%20Prophet%20%28Civ6%29](Great Prophet) at either a [Holy%20Site%20%28Civ6%29](Holy Site) or [Stonehenge%20%28Civ6%29](Stonehenge).
Zoroastrian places of worship are represented in-game by the [Dar-e%20Mehr%20%28Civ6%29](Dar-e Mehr), though there is no real gameplay relation between the religion and the [Building%20%28Civ6%29](building).
