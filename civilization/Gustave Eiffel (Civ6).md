Strategy.
Gustave Eiffel is a later game version of [Isidore%20of%20Miletus%20%28Civ6%29](Isidore of Miletus) and [Filippo%20Brunelleschi%20%28Civ6%29](Filippo Brunelleschi), and the same strategy applies to him. Recruit him if you are focused on getting wonders quickly. He is especially effective if you have constructed the [Mausoleum%20at%20Halicarnassus%20%28Civ6%29](Mausoleum at Halicarnassus), which boosts his total output to 1440 - almost enough to singlehandedly complete a [Modern%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Modern Era) wonder (such as [Eiffel%20Tower%20%28Civ6%29](his eponymous Tower)).
