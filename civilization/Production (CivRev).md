# Production (CivRev)

Production is used to build [List%20of%20units%20in%20CivRev](units), [List%20of%20buildings%20in%20CivRev](buildings), and [Wonder%20%28CivRev%29](wonders). The more production you have the faster things will be built.
You can get production in many ways. You can get it from citizens working in the [City%20%28CivRev%29](city), [Mountains%20%28CivRev%29](mountains), and [Hill%20%28CivRev%29](hills). [Workshop%20%28CivRev%29](Workshops) and [Factory%20%28CivRev%29](Factories) help you generate more production.
