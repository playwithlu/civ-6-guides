Civilopedia entry.
Before gunpowder rendered them obsolete, many cities constructed city walls to protect against attack. City walls represented a major investment in time and materials, requiring years to complete and constant repairs to maintain their strangth and integrity. However, these walls turned the city into a fortress capable of withstanding all but the most determined attack. The development of cannon put an end to the usefulness of walls in stopping large armies.
