# Charge (Civ6)/Civilopedia

There is nothing – at least before tanks spoiled everything – more thrilling and effective than a charge by heavy cavalry; unfortunately, they didn't occur very often. Battles were rarely fought on level, dry, and open ground suitable for such picturesque battle. By the end of the 14th century, in fact, most knights dismounted to fight, and their prized destriers were led to the rear ... except for the French, but look what happened at Crécy, Poitiers, and Agincourt. But if the cavalry charge did reach the enemy, the shock of contact could overwhelm defensive positions, even those sheltered by field works. But the advent of machine guns, barbed wire, and mines put an end to all that glorious charging.
