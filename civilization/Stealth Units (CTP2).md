Gameplay.
Stealth Units are some of the more powerful units in Call To Power II. Primarily, any entity with normal vision (standard units, cities, listening posts) cannot see stealth units - they are only visible to each other. In addition, almost all Stealth Units have unconventional attacks. They can siphon , interrupt , raise and lower , steal and information or wage war with weapons of mass destruction.
Players are wise to do everything they can to prevent Stealth Unit attacks.
