Strategy.
Singapore can be a valuable ally for any [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization), since sending s is just something you would do anyway, and this city-state just makes it an even more bountiful task by increasing the potential of international s. However, this city-state comes with a catch. In order to maximize the benefits of being its Suzerain, you will have to diversify your trade partners in every city. The counts the number of trade partners each city has, so your empire can be trading with the entire world, but if one of your cities can be trading with only one next-door neighbor, that city will only receive 2 . Therefore, this city-state is only good for civilizations that have many s to leverage its bonus ([Phoenician%20%28Civ6%29](Phoenicia), [Malian%20%28Civ6%29](Mali), [English%20%28Civ6%29](England), [Portuguese%20%28Civ6%29](Portugal)), want to form [Alliance%20%28Civ6%29](Alliances) with as many other civilizations as possible (so they can benefit from [Wisselbanken%20%28Civ6%29](Wisselbanken) and [Democracy%20%28Civ6%29](Democracy) while trading with all of their partners, like [Egyptian%20%28Civ6%29](Egypt), [Cree%20%28Civ6%29](Cree) and, again, Portugal), have extended trade range (Portugal), or have Loyalty bonuses to put cities at the crossroad of many civilizations to maximize the number of possible trade partners (Phoenicia).
