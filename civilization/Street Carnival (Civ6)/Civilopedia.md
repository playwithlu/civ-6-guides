# Street Carnival (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Many cities have street carnivals – especially during the Christian season of Lent – but only Brazilians really know how to cast care to the wind during such festivals. Parades, concerts, performances, masques, and public banquets (along with liberal amounts of alcohol) fuel the celebrations. According to stuffy postmodern sociologists, Carnival as a social institution provides more than just a respite from the seriousness of urban life, it serves as a release for natural impulses that threaten the social order and allows marginalized groups to focus attention on social conflicts by embodying them in "senseless" activities. Whatever the truth of this interpretation, Rio de Janeiro's is the world's largest street carnival, hosting upwards of two million participants a day in recent years.
