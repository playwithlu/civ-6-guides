Civilopedia entry.
Before the advent of the assembly line and modern manufacturing, many goods were created in small workshops by craftsmen and their apprentices. The quality and production was determined solely by the skill and experience of the workers - trades were learned over years and jobs were often passed down from generation to generation. With the arrival of the Industrial Revolution, workshops were supplanted by far more efficient (if brutal and dehumanizing) factories.
