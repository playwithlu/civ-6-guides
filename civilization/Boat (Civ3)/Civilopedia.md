# Boat (Civ3)/Civilopedia

The boat is the naval unit of the various barbarian tribes. It is roughly on par with the
Curragh although, unlike the lowly curragh, it can initiate an attack. Since
the emphasis is on building wondrous monuments in this scenario, the various barbarian units have
been given no build cost to prevent the player from accruing large amounts of victory points by
concentrating on killing barbarians.
