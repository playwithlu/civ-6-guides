# Philotas (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Philip’s general Parmenion supported Alexander’s ascension to the throne. In return, the new king elevated Parmenion’s son Philotas to general in command of the Companion cavalry. Despite his capability on the battlefield, Philotas’s rebellious streak led him to plot treason, which brought about the death of himself and his father.
