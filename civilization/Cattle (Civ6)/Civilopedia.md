# Cattle (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Whether beef, dairy, or draft animals, cattle in all their forms have been serving mankind since before history began. In fact, it appears that wild aurochs were domesticated at some point around 10,500 years ago in what is today Turkey. Evidence shows that cattle were being used as a medium of barter around 7000 BC in the Indian subcontinent. Ever since, cattle and oxen have supplied meat and milk, leather and horn, and been beasts of burden and objects of religious devotion.
