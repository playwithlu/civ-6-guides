# Medic (Civ6)

The Medic is an [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Support](support unit) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
In the "" expansion, the Medic can upgrade to a [Supply%20Convoy%20%28Civ6%29](Supply Convoy).
Strategy.
In "Civilization VI", units in hostile [Territory%20%28Civ6%29](territory) can heal only 5 HP per turn, which is very little when exposed to continuous fire. Here's where the Medic comes in - thanks to its services unit healing becomes significantly better, which may mean the difference between a successful siege and a defeat of your army. And don't think that just because your [Artillery%20%28Civ6%29](Artillery) can shoot a [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) from afar, your other units will be completely safe - the enemy has tons of other means of harming an invading army in the [Modern%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Modern Era).
Notably, the Medic also increases the healing rate of based [Air%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](air units) and allows adjacent [Naval%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](naval units) to heal outside of friendly territory.
