# Anansi (Civ6)

Anansi is a [Heroes%20%26amp%3B%20Legends%20%28Civ6%29%23Heroes](Hero) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". He is exclusive to the [Heroes%20%26amp%3B%20Legends%20%28Civ6%29](Heroes &amp; Legends) [Game%20Mode%20%28Civ6%29](game mode), introduced in the [Babylon%20Pack%20%28Civ6%29](Babylon Pack).
Strategy.
Like all Hero units, Anansi's Strength increases with the progression of the [Era%20%28Civ6%29](eras), as shown in the table below.
The and yields of Anansi's Tricks start at 60 and 50 (respectively) and increase by 30 per era.
Anansi's Tricks works regardless of who owns a resource. While it does generate if used within the [Territory%20%28Civ6%29](territory) of a major [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) (15 per use, regardless of whether the resource is improved or not), a strong strategy is to send him into the territory of someone with whom you have Open Borders and remove key resources, crippling their [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) while reaping strong yields at the same time. On the other hand, a safer strategy that doesn't generate is to send him to resources that are right next to an enemy's [Borders%20%28Civ6%29](borders) and destroy them before they get subsumed into the enemy's territory.
Anansi's Tricks cannot be used in territory owned by an [Alliance%20%28Civ6%29](Ally), but it can be used in territory owned by a [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-state) of which you are [Suzerain%20%28Civ6%29](Suzerain). If Anansi is the first Hero you recruit, this ability can single-handedly provide enough to unlock [Political%20Philosophy%20%28Civ6%29](Political Philosophy) (giving you access to the first Tier 1 [Government%20%28Civ6%29](governments)).
Bugs.
Using Anansi's Tricks on a [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tile) with an [Industry%20%28Civ6%29](Industry) or [Corporation%20%28Civ6%29](Corporation) will remove all benefits and prevent that type of Industry from being rebuilt. Removing the [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](improvement) beforehand will circumvent this issue.
