# Privateer (Col)

A Privateer is a ship owned by an individual that has obtained a "Letter of Marque" from his government, giving him the "right" to prey upon foreign shipping. Privateers can be very dangerous to your commerce because they observe no code of international behavior; the countries sponsoring them will likely claim no knowledge of their actions.
