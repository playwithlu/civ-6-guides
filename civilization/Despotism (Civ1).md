# Despotism (Civ1)

Despotism is the initial [Government%20%28Civ1%29](government) form in "[Sid%20Meier%27s%20Civilization](Civilization)".
Civilopedia entry.
Despotism is a primitive form of government that is nevertheless useful for a
beginning civilization. Due to the minimum of maintenance required for units,
it is possible to field relatively large armies for the population and build
new items quickly. However, the growth of cities is ultimately retarded by
despotism and in order for them to continue to grow to substantial size you
must adopt a new form of government that increases food and resource
production. Despotism is most useful during expansion and wartime.
Advisers are represented by Mongols in ancient age and hoodlums in the modern age.
The leader is known as Emperor.
