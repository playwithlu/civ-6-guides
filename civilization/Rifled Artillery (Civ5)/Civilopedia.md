# Rifled Artillery (Civ5)/Civilopedia

Rifling adds grooves to the inside of the barrel of cannon to improve the range and accuracy of the piece, at the cost of increased expense to manufacture and the need for a longer barrel. Both the Union and Confederate armies in the Eastern Theater included batteries of rifled artillery, along with batteries of mixed smooth-bore and rifled cannons.
