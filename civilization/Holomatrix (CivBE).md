# Holomatrix (CivBE)

Strategy.
The Holomatrix is an advanced communications/entertainment hub which serves the same role as the old TV satellites on Earth. The new ways of entertainment this satellite makes possible increase vastly the Culture of your people. Besides that, with so many interesting things to watch and experience, people tend to get less involved in enemy spying operations, which diminishes sharply the rate at which Intrigue increases in cities affected by the Holomatrix, making it an effective anti-spying unit.
