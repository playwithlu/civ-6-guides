Intro.
 João III, you stand firm in your beliefs and guide others to them. As you spread your religion and your trade networks beyond your shores, bring prosperity back to your people, so that they may experience new ways of being unlike any seen before.
In-Game.

Detailed Approach.
A successful Portuguese [Victory%20%28Civ6%29](victory) will depend upon building vast trade networks and exploiting [Coastal%20%28Civ6%29](coastal) [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles).

Further, coastal cities can take full advantage of the [Navigation%20School%20%28Civ6%29](Navigation School), giving extra towards [Naval%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](naval units), extra for [Coast%20%28Civ6%29](coast) and [Lake%20%28Civ6%29](lake) tiles, and extra points.
