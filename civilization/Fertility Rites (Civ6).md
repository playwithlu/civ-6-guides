Fertility Rites is a [Pantheon%20%28Civ6%29](Pantheon) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It increases the growth rate of all [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) by 10%. In "", it also provides a free [Builder%20%28Civ6%29](Builder) in the founder's .
Strategy.
Almost any other pantheon is better than Fertility Rites. Its bonus is based on modified total "after" Citizen consumption and not each city's total output, which makes it too trivial to be helpful.
With the [Civilization%20VI%20June%202019%20Update](June 2019 Update), the free Builder makes this pantheon slightly more tempting.
