# Charity (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Charity can refer to the deep love for the Divinity and humanity, as well as compassionate acts performed in the world (such as distributing alms and bread to the needy). These compassionate acts are usually seen as being external reflections of that deep, divine love, and many religions give charity a place of great honor.
