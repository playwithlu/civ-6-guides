# Truffles (Civ5)

Game Info.
Luxury resource added in "".
Strategy.
 Truffles, a new resource added in "Gods &amp; Kings", appear on [Forest%20%28Civ5%29](Forest), [Marsh%20%28Civ5%29](Marsh), and (more rarely) [Jungle%20%28Civ5%29](Jungle) tiles. They're accessed via [Camp%20%28Civ5%29](Camps), which allows you to preserve the Forest on the tile. Like all other luxury resources that are accessed this way, their bonus is 2 , which makes them nice to settle a [City%20%28Civ5%29](city) on.
