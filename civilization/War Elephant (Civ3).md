# War Elephant (Civ3)

[Indian%20%28Civ3%29](Indian) War Elephants are powerful offensive units, and, like all fast units, will withdraw from battle if they are losing the conflict. But when engaged with other fast units, they do not withdraw. Only India can build war elephants instead of [Knight%20%28Civ3%29](knights).
