The Frigate is the most advanced [Naval%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](naval unit) of its time! Its superior hull and long-range cannons make it capable of powerful ranged attacks while having strong defenses against melee attackers. The Frigate's vast capabilities allow it to not only completely dominate the seas of the Renaissance Era, but also to support land armies from the coast, attacking both units and [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities).
A combination of Frigates and [Caravel%20%28Civ6%29](Caravels) is able to bring down even the strongest defenses of [Coastal%20%28Civ6%29](coastal) cities if left unchecked. This is due to the hidden bonus vs. city defenses, which allows the Frigate to do (almost) full damage against walls! Concentrate Frigate fire to wear down the city defense, then finish it off with Caravels!
