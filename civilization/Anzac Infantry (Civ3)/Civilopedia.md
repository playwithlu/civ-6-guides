# Anzac Infantry (Civ3)/Civilopedia

The infantryman of the Commonwealth "nation" in this scenario is the "Anzac Infantry", representing the soldiers
of the Australia and New Zealand Army Corps (or ANZAC). These soldiers were a tough lot, receiving their first
baptism of fire of WWII in the sands of North Africa. When war suddenly broke out in the Pacific, most of the
Anzac forces serving in the European Theatre were rushed home to defend Australia and New Zealand from the
encroaching Nipponese infantry. Like their Asian enemy, Anzac forces were
well trained in jungle warfare, which was put to good use in the jungles of New Guinea along the Kokoda Trail.
