# Globalization (Civ5)

Game Info.
Modern technology makes possible an event that is almost unheard of: Globalization. In a world where all peoples of the Earth may know of everything going on with each one of them in real time, and do something about it almost immediately, diplomatic communication becomes paramount for maintaining the peace.
Globalization allows the development of the [United%20Nations%20%28Civ5%29](United Nations), a World Congress where all civilizations and [City-state%20%28Civ5%29](City-States) get together to discuss their problems and solutions. This in turn starts the path towards [Diplomatic%20victory%20%28Civ5%29](diplomatic victory).
In "[Brave%20New%20World](Brave New World)", this technology acts differently, but is again very useful towards pursuing a diplomatic victory.
