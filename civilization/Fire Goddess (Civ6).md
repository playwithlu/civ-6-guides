Strategy.
Fire Goddess is a useful pantheon for the [M%C4%81ori%20%28Civ6%29](MƒÅori) (whose [Marae%20%28Civ6%29](unique building) provides extra and from [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles) with passable features), the [Ethiopian%20%28Civ6%29](Ethiopians) (who can already generate huge amounts of from Volcanic Soil with the [Rock-Hewn%20Church%20%28Civ6%29](Rock-Hewn Church)), the [Incan%20%28Civ6%29](Inca) (who have an incentive to settle in regions where Geothermal Fissures and Volcanic Soil are most commonly found), and the [Hungarian%20%28Civ6%29](Hungarians) and [Spanish%20%28Civ6%29](Spanish) (both of whom have a [Starting%20bias%20%28Civ6%29](starting bias) for Geothermal Fissures). It's also somewhat useful for players who spawn in [Africa](Africa) on an [Earth%20%28map%29%20%28Civ6%29](Earth) [Map%20%28Civ6%29](map), since they have guaranteed access to two Geothermal Fissures if they settle near [Mount%20Kilimanjaro%20%28Civ6%29](Mount Kilimanjaro); and for those who choose a Primordial map or one with a newer [Starting%20a%20new%20game%20%28Civ6%29%23Advanced%20Setup](World Age), on which [Volcano%20%28Civ6%29](Volcanoes) are more likely to be present.
