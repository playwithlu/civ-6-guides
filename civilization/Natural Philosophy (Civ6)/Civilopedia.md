# Natural Philosophy (Civ6)/Civilopedia

From the days of Aristotle, natural philosophy was the study of the physical world, the first systematic “science.” Every other science – biology, physics, chemistry, astronomy, mathematics, and all – has its roots in natural philosophy, and most of Aristotle’s predecessors such as Parmenides, Heraclitus, and Democritus centered their beliefs on the natural order. Aristotle’s conceptions of the laws that govern the real world, set down in the Corpus Aristotelicum (the bits that survived), prevailed into the Middle Ages. Although the empirical study and understanding of everything would separate into various scientific disciplines, it all began with natural philosophy. And now the boundaries between the disciplines are getting blurry again.
