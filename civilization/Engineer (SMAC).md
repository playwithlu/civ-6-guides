# Engineer (SMAC)

Engineers are specialist citizens in "[Sid%20Meier%27s%20Alpha%20Centauri](Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri)".
A corps of engineers can optimize all of a base's functions, yielding +3 to {{LinkSMAC|Economy}} and +2 to {{LinkSMAC|Labs}} per engineer. They are acquired along with {{LinkSMAC|Fusion Power}} technology, and they never become obsolete.
