# Retainers (Civ6)

Retainers is a Military [Policy%20Cards%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
Retainers is a good Military Policy to have if you are an expansionist bully who has serious problems with the other [Leaders%20%28Civ6%29](leaders) and can't trade for additional [Resources%20%28Civ6%29%23Luxury%20Resources](luxury resources). Chances are you will then have enough [Units%20%28Civ6%29](units) to station in your [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities), at least when not at war. The catch is that you will need it most when at war, due to [War%20weariness%20%28Civ6%29](war weariness) pulling down your general count, so you should separate some units to remain as garrisons and make use of Retainers while your main army is out conquering.
If you're not a militaristic [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization), you may not need this Policy at all. And chances are also that you won't go with [Monarchy%20%28Civ6%29](Monarchy), which is the Tier 2 [Government%20%28Civ6%29](government) with the most Military slots, but with another government type - this means that there are other Policies which may be more useful than Retainers. ([Conscription%20%28Civ6%29](Conscription) remains always useful, and a possible second slot may be used on a rotational basis for a building-oriented Policy.) Still, if your strategy doesn't call for anything else, and you have spare slots, you may use Retainers to boost your cities' general performance. Remember to keep units in each one, though!
