# Longboats (C-evo)

Longboats are the only pre-designed in the free game "[C-evo](C-evo)".
They require . They can carry only one or two land units and with maximum "speed" of 2.5 and are restricted to "coast" (shallow water) tiles and ports. Defensive value is 3 (with no offensive strength) and standard cost is 20 material.
Valuable for exploration if your world is less than 90% land though less valuable on a small world.. Valuable for finding exploitable fish that are just out of range of early land unit view.
The standard [AI](AI) often sends out flotillas of them, very inefficient for exploration but often good for blocking other nations' boats.
