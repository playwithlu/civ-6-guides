The Diary of Lady Murasaki
{{Quote|quote=As a young boy my brother Nobunori studied the Chinese classics, and I liked to sit in and listen to his lessons. I found that even when he struggled to understand or memorize passages, I would find them remarkably easy. My father, a well-read man himself, often used to lament this fact, saying, 'Such a shame. Would that you were born a man!'|audio=The Diary of Lady Murasaki (Civ6).ogg}}
