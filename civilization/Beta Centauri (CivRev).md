# Beta Centauri (CivRev)

Beta Centauri is a [List%20of%20scenarios%20in%20CivRev](scenario) in "[Civilization%20Revolution](Civilization Revolution)".
Description.
In Beta Centauri your civilization has landed on a new planet and must start over on this new world, but other civilizations have the same ideas and the native aliens (which are played by barbarians) don't like you being here.
Your people are not interested in getting back in a cramped ship so you cannot win a Technology Victory.
Gameplay.
This [List%20of%20scenarios%20in%20CivRev](scenario) is different from a standard game in the fact that...
1. All Civilizations have researched all the techs in the technology tree
2. Despite number 1 the Technology Victory is disabled and cannot be reached.
Strategy.
Despite the fact that [Technology%20Victory](Technology Victory) is disabled and the players are made aware of this from the start (and it is mentioned on the who is winning screen) "nobody told the AI this"! Expect AI controlled civilizations to declare wars on you to stop you from winning a Technology victory early and often.
The [American%20%28CivRev%29](American) is the best civilization in this scenario since it spawns with either a [Great%20Merchant](Great Merchant), which is then used to spawn a [Settler](Settler) and [Greater%20Builder](Greater Builder), with is then used to instantly construct a x3 production [Factory](Factory). This potentially allows the Americans to immediately outproduce rival civs at triple the production values at the start of turn 1.
