# Hernan Cortes (Civ4Col)

Civilopedia.
Lived: 1485-1547
Hernan Cortes was a Spanish Conquistador renowned for his actions as a conqueror and misidentified deity. Hernan Cortes' early journeys to the New World met with less than wondrous results: his position as a notary in Azua was far from glorious and his position as secretary to the governor of Cuba, Diego Velasquez, was revoked shortly after he began. And though he was later granted an administrative position in the Cuban city of Santiago, it would be a journey to Mexico, six hundred men, and an unheard of series of lucky events that would forever solidify Cortes' name as the conqueror of the Aztecs. Welcomed into the Aztec society as a lost god, Quetzalcoatl, Cortes quickly capitalized on this position through trickery, duplicity and bloodshed. To the shock of both European and native, Cortes succeeded in putting down a nation of millions and securing near unfathomable wealth.
