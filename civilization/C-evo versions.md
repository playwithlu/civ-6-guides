# C-evo versions

The 2013 version of [C-evo](C-evo) is numbered 1.2.0 - currently (Nov 2016) the latest.
1.1.3.
Here copied from the archived forums is Steffen's summary of changes that were made for 1.1.3. Portions now bold explain some of what happens under 1.2.0.
AI improvement. This is what this version is mainly about (as you can see from the StandardAI.dll growing by a third). AI now builds a spaceship and all wonders, if you give it enough time. Also it's more aggressive in some situations, an army of 100 howitzers will no longer be afraid of a single strong defender. These are just the most noticeable changes, all in all it's about 20 mostly minor improvements. Of course, it's still far from perfect, for example it still doesn't build aircraft and is helpless against such. Also it's still unable to do a diplomatic agreement apart from peace, friendship and technology exchange.
The Beginner level is now suitable for beginners, which was not really the case before. The handicap for the AI is bigger than before, and most important the AI doesn't get aggressive on that level. So the concession to the beginner is an exception from the general philosophy of the game: the AI doesn't really try to win there. Since I cannot make promises for other AIs you can play this level only against the Standard AI. The former Beginner level is now the Easy level, while the former Easy level is no longer available. So together with the AI improvement the difficulty levels now cover a wider range. The easiest is easier, the hardest are harder.
A rule change: The nation territory information is now always up-to-date in a region that was already discovered. So you don't see wrong borders anymore because your information is outdated. If the borders change, you see them changing without sending a unit there again. This was my best idea to overcome those ugly ripped nonsense borders when a tile was seen more recently than the one beside it, which happend often.
A second rule change: No transport submarines anymore.
Some optical modifications.
An example game is now contained in the package.
