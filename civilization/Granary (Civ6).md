# Granary (Civ6)

The Granary is a basic Population [Building%20%28Civ6%29](building) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is built in the [City%20Center%20%28Civ6%29](City Center).
Strategy.
The Granary is one of the first buildings in the game, built in the City Center, and takes care of the [City%20%28Civ6%29](city's) early needs. It is useful for any city, but it is especially so for cities which have no access to Fresh Water. In such cities, it should be either the first or one of the first buildings constructed, in order to allow the city's Population to grow to any useful size.
