Civilopedia entry.
One alternative to fossil fuel power generation is the Hydroelectric Power Plant. These use the energy of falling water to turn turbines at high speed and thereby generate electricity. Where water flow rates make Hydro Plants practical, they offer safe and clean electricity, free of the pollution and acid rain caused by burning fossil fuels. Hydro Plants are not free of problems, however. They create their own environmental disruptions, flooding large areas behind their dams, interrupting the normal flow of rivers, and destroying the habitats of wild animal species.
