# Mohenjo-Daro (Civ6)

Mohenjo-Daro is a cultural [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-state) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
Although Mohenjo-Daro's bonuses grant bonus , its unique bonus gives a [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) full (up to 5) to all cities as if they were settled on fresh water. It is valuable to civilizations that have are incentivized or perhaps forced to settle on the coast, like [Australian%20%28Civ6%29](Australia), but it does not affect the [Mayan%20%28Civ6%29](Maya), whose [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) do not receive benefits from being adjacent to fresh water.
