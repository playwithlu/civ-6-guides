# The Middle Ages (Civ3)

 is a [List%20of%20scenarios%20in%20Civ3](scenario) in "".
Description.
In 843, the great empire of Charlemagne is divided into three parts. The Christian leaders of these kingdoms of Franks, Germans, and Burgundians each have a holy relic that needs to be returned to Jerusalem (to earn 10000 bonus VP). A fourth relic resides with Alfred the Great in his fledgling English nation to the north. Play as one of these four Western Christian civilizations, one of four Viking powers, one of four Muslim powers, or as the Byzantines. Who can rule the greatest kingdom of the Middle Ages by the year 1453?
Intro.
Background.
It is the year 843 AD. Remnants of the Roman Empire linger near the Byzantine stronghold of Constantinople, but the glory days of the Roman empire are 500 years in the past. Europe has seen one great empire since then, the Carolingian dynasty of the mighty Charlemagne. Now even he has left us, and the just-concluded Treaty of Verdun has split his mighty holdings among Franks, Burgundians, and Germans. These Christian nations carefully watch the sea for signs of the Viking raiders that torment the region.
Special.
The Dark Ages tech tree for this scenario is split into four optional paths, one for each of the following civilization types:
Study the tree carefully so each advance you research provides benefit for your civilization type.
Victory.
Medieval countries live and die according to the fate and prowess of their king or queen. This scenario is no exception. Mass Regicide is enabled, so a civ is eliminated from the game as soon as all of their king units die. Assuming you keep your kings alive and withstand the ailment that besets Europe late in the game, the final victor is determined by victory points. VP are scored throughout the game using standard values. There is only one VP location on the map, the Holy City of Jerusalem. Each playable Christian nation starts the game with a holy relic; returning one to its rightful place in the Holy City yields a bonus of 10000 extra VP for completing this crusade.
