# Light Tank (Civ3)/Civilopedia

During WWII, the Pacific theatre proportionally saw more light tanks in combat than medium or heavy models. This was no doubt due in large part to the lower ground pressure of the light tank compared to
its heavier brethren (thus less chance of bogging in soft terrain), and to the relative ease of transporting the
smaller, lighter vehicles on transport ships and amphibious landing vehicles. Light tanks had thinner armor than
medium tanks, and their guns were generally of smaller size. The U.S. supplied both their own and Commonwealth
troops with many hundreds of light tanks (models M3 and M5, both with a 37mm main gun). On the other side, the
most common Japanese light tank during WWII was the Type 95 "Ha Go" (also sporting a 37mm main gun), which saw
its first action with the Kwantung Army during 1937 in China.
