# Mountain (Civ5)

A Mountain is a type of [Terrain%20%28Civ5%29%23Terrain%20Features](terrain feature) in "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)".
Game Info.
Terrain feature found anywhere on land tiles.
Strategy.
Mountain tiles are impassable to almost all [Unit%20%28Civ5%29](units) except [Air%20unit%20%28Civ5%29](air units). They provide nothing to [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities) other than the opportunity to build [Machu%20Picchu%20%28Civ5%29](Machu Picchu), [Neuschwanstein%20%28Civ5%29](Neuschwanstein), and [Observatory%20%28Civ5%29](Observatories). Note that a city must be right next to a Mountain (or mountainous [Natural%20wonder%20%28Civ5%29](natural wonder)) to build an Observatory, but both [List%20of%20wonders%20in%20Civ5](wonders) can be built in a city within 2 tiles of a Mountain (so long as that Mountain is not a natural wonder).
Mountains are usually great obstacles to [Movement%20%28Civ5%29](movement), and can provide natural defensive barriers. Just be wary of [Carthaginian%20%28Civ5%29](Carthaginian) players, who can negate their defensive properties after earning a [Great%20General%20%28Civ5%29](Great General)!
It may be advantageous to settle a city right next to a Mountain so that you can build the aforementioned wonders and [Building%20%28Civ5%29](building) there. However, you shouldn't go out of your way to do so unless you're playing as the [Incan%20%28Civ5%29](Inca) - they can put Mountains and adjacent [Hill%20%28Civ5%29](Hill) tiles to really good use!
