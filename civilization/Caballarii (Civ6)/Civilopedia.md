# Caballarii (Civ6)/Civilopedia

The vast majority of the Frankish troops during the Carolingian dynasty were simply infantry spearmen – the Franks having long before abandoned their traditional 'francisca' throwing ax – but the king did maintain an elite mounted contingent of heavy cavalry… the famed caballarius. Initially these caballarii were housed in or near the palace, but in time spread among the greater landed magnates as well. Whereas most of the troops were merely levies called up in time of war, the caballarius were “professionals,” and even provided temporary leaders for the less well-trained Frankish units. Divided into 'scara' (non-standardized regiments), the caballarii of Charlemagne seem to have been divided into three ranks of prestige, with the 'scholares' being the king’s personal bodyguard. The caballarii could, it seems, be used as true shock troops when mounted, or could dismount and fight on foot. And proved quite effective in either case.
