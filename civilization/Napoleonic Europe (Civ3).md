# Napoleonic Europe (Civ3)

 is a [List%20of%20scenarios%20in%20Civ3](scenario) in "".
Description.
The age of Napoleon has arrived! Nationalism is sweeping through the lands. Strong infantry and cavalry forces of a newly rejuvenated France, under the direction of several great military leaders, stand ready to bring "reforms" to the other nations of Europe. Across the channel, Britain is in a locked alliance with Portugal, the Netherlands and the Kingdom of Naples. Other countries are unaligned -- but not uninterested in the future shape of Europe. Can Napoleon conquer all, or will the other nations work together to contain his imperialistic motives?
Intro.
Background.
It is 1800 -- the start of a new century! In France a man named Napoleon has come to power and nationalistic fervor is sweeping the country. Although a man of small stature, it appears his aspirations for France and Europe are indeed huge. The French military has been recently reorganized, and now boasts legions of dangerous "voltigeurs".
Special.
This scenario features two "Locked Alliances" as well as six non-aligned nations. The French Coalition consists of France and Denmark; the British Coalition includes Britain, the Netherlands, Portugal and the Kingdom of Naples. The non-aligned nations are Austria, Prussia, Russia, Spain, and the Ottoman Empire (all playable), as well as Sweden.
Victory.
Victory is achieved by the first side to amass 60,000 VP, "or" gain a Domination victory by the standard means (control of 40% of the terrain and 40% of the population). Otherwise, the winner is the side with the highest score at game end (the end of 1815, following 96 two-month turns).
Notes.
Each playable nation has cavalry and musket-armed infantry and units with individualized attack and defense strengths. Additionally, four nations (France, Britain, Russia and the Ottoman Empire) can build powerful elite infantry after researching Advanced Tactics.
