# Big Ben (Civ5)/Civilopedia

Big Ben is the clock (and the clock tower) at the northern end of the Houses of Parliament in London, England. Big Ben (the clock) is famous for its accuracy and for its massive bell which weighs more than 13 tons and tolls out the day's hours.
Big Ben was designed by Lord Edmund Grimthorpe and constructed by Edward Dent and his son, Frederick. The clock and bell were installed in the tower in 1859. Big Ben is the second largest four-faced clock in the world. At the base of each face of the clock is the Latin inscription, "Oh Lord, keep safe our Queen Victoria the First."
