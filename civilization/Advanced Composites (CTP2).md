Gameplay.
The discovery of Advanced Composites enables the manufacture of highly evolved plastics, ceramics and carbon fiber materials. They are stronger, lighter and more resilient than even the finest metal materials, and are used to replace steel, titanium and aluminum as the building materials of choice in aircraft. The {{LinkCTP2|Stealth Fighter}} and {{LinkCTP2|Stealth Bomber}} are comprised almost entirely of composite materials, allowing engineers to construct their bizarre radar-evading shapes and still maintain structural integrity.
Great Library entry.
Advanced Composites, the most powerful of all plastics, were one of the most important discoveries of the late 20th century. Although the invention of plastics revolutionized manufacturing in the 20th century, advanced aeronautics and space flight demanded materials that were lighter, and at the same time stronger, than conventional metals. Ceramics, carbon fiber, resin and injected-foam molding comprise many of the composites that make space travel and stealth technology possible.
