# Celtic (Civ4)

The Celtic people (or Celts) represent a [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ4](civilization) in "[Civilization%20IV](Civilization IV)".
Strategy.
If you are playing as the Celts, you can start off the game by rushing [Iron%20Working%20%28Civ4%29](Iron Working), and then making an army of [Gallic%20Warrior%20%28Civ4%29](Gallic Warriors). [Swordsman%20%28Civ4%29](Swordsmen) can be pretty brutal to an enemy without any [Walls%20%28Civ4%29](Walls) or [Axeman%20%28Civ4%29](Axemen), so if you hit an enemy early, you can get a bunch of extra [City%20%28Civ4%29](cities). If playing as Boudica, your Gallic Warriors also start with [Combat%20%28promotion%29%20%28Civ4%29](Combat I) from her [Aggressive%20%28Civ4%29](Aggressive) trait.
The [Dun%20%28Civ4%29](Dun) gives a free [Guerrilla%20%28Civ4%29](Guerrilla I) [Promotion%20%28Civ4%29](promotion) to eligible units (Recon, Archery, Gunpowder). Since Gallic Warriors start with Guerrilla I, this aspect of the Dun is a bit redundant, even though they wouldn't get that promotion from the Dun. It's still a nice [List%20of%20buildings%20in%20Civ4](building) for defending your lands.
If you find yourself behind the tech curve from all that early aggression, you can instead opt to take advantage of Brennus' [Spiritual%20%28Civ4%29](Spiritual) [Leader%20trait%20%28Civ4%29](trait) in the late game. One can build up goodwill with the other [Leaders%20%28Civ4%29](leaders) by agreeing to whatever [List%20of%20civics%20in%20Civ4](civic)/[Religion%20%28Civ4%29](religion) changes they may ask of you, because there is no [Anarchy%20%28Civ4%29](anarchy). One can also switch to [Organized%20Religion%20%28Civ4%29](Organized Religion) and [Universal%20Suffrage%20%28Civ4%29](Universal Suffrage) when building the [United%20Nations%20%28Civ4%29](United Nations) to help rush it. From there, one can attempt to get a [Victory%20%28Civ4%29%23Diplomatic](Diplomatic Victory).
