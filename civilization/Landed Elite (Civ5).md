# Landed Elite (Civ5)

Landed Elite is a [Social%20policies%20%28Civ5%29](social policy) in "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)". It is part of the [Tradition%20%28Civ5%29](Tradition) tree and requires [Legalism%20%28Civ5%29](Legalism).
The distribution of the land in the empire among its elite class tends to funnel food production towards the empire's {{Capital5}} (where they usually live in splendor).
Strategy.
This level 3 Policy is a great way to increase {{PopulationIcon5}} Population growth in the Capital, and is one of the main benefits of the [Tradition%20%28Civ5%29](Tradition) tree. If you manage to complete it soon afterwards, the added benefit of a free [Aqueduct%20%28Civ5%29](Aqueduct) makes a nice combo!
