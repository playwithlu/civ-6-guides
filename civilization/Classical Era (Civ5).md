Game Info.
The Classical Era is time for expansion. You will establish more [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities), produce [Worker%20%28Civ5%29](Workers), continue improving your [Territory%20%28Civ5%29](lands) and connecting your cities with [Road%20%28Civ5%29](Roads). If you haven't already, establish [International%20trade%20route%20%28Civ5%29](trade routes) and take care of your economy, because expenses will keep piling up! But remember that [Barbarian%20%28Civ5%29](Barbarians) still represent a threat, especially to your trade!
You should also attempt to create a [Religion%20%28Civ5%29](Religion), and build some [List%20of%20wonders%20in%20Civ5](wonders).
You will now have access to the full tactical range of weapons in the game, including cavalry and siege engines. More aggressive [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilizations) will probably attack their neighbors, and you should get ready to defend your lands from invasions. Or (if you're the fighting type), you should invade your neighbors! Good luck in your first serious battles, general!
