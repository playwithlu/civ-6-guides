# Tambo (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Tambos were buildings strategically spaced out along the Incas' imperial road system. Used as way stations, travelers could stop and rest at these sites, and also barter trade goods and participate in cultural events. With their tambos, their llamas, and their Chasqui scouts, the Incan empire was able to spread their cultural, political, and military influence throughout the Andes Mountains.
