Civilopedia entry.
A mine is a system of props, beams, walls and supports that allow miners to (more or less) safely extract valuable material from deep underground. The earliest mines were constructed of wood and those inside were at more or less constant risk of death by cave-in, fire, flood or asphyxiation. While still dangerous, modern mines are far safer than their predecessors. The South African gold mines are the deepest mines in the world, with shafts reaching depths of 3,777 meters (2.3 miles) beneath the surface.
