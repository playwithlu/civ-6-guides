Great Library entry.
Civilizations have built grand monuments to pay homage to their heroes, whether political leaders or mythical gods. The Washington Monument, completed in 1884, stands more than 550 feet tall in the American capital as a tribute to the first American president, George Washington. Approximately 2,000 years earlier, the Greeks erected the Statue of Zeus to celebrate their god.
