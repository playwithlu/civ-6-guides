# Final Frontier (Civ4)/Terrain features

Radiation Cloud.
Radiation clouds replace [fallout](fallout) in the Civ4 "[Beyond%20the%20Sword](Beyond the Sword)" mod "[Final%20Frontier%20%28Civ4%29](Final Frontier)". They are very similar, only radiation clouds are green, appear to wave, and don't poison your cities, whereas fallout flashes orange, poisons your cities, and doesn't damage your units. Other than that, they're practically the same. They're both radioactive.
