# Niter (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Better known as saltpeter, niter is the mineral form of potassium nitrate. Although known for millennia, it didnâ€™t become important until the Chinese figured out it could be combined with sulfur to make gunpowder in the mid-1st century AD. And gunpowder is really good for making fireworks and blowing things up. Niter is also useful as a fertilizer and food preservative, but few people remember that.
