# Shakespeare's Theatre (CivRev)

Shakespeare's Theatre is a [Wonder%20%28CivRev%29](wonder) in "[Civilization%20Revolution](Civilization Revolution)".
This wonder can be built when the player discovers the [Literacy%20%28CivRev%29](Literacy) [List%20of%20technologies%20in%20CivRev](technology) and its benefit is that it doubles the production of [Culture%20%28CivRev%29](culture) in the [City%20%28CivRev%29](city) in which it is built. This wonder's benefit is cancelled when any civilization discovers the [Mass%20Media%20%28CivRev%29](Mass Media) technology.
Note that this wonder affects only the city that builds it, not the owner's entire [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20CivRev](civilization).
