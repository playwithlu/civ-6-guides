Strategy.
While it's tempting to get the free tech early in the game, early alien artifacts should be reserved for building the most important early Secret Project, [The%20Planetary%20Transit%20System%20%28SMAC%29](the Planetary Transit System). After getting [Centauri%20Ecology%20%28SMAC%29](Centaur Ecology), you should beeline for [Industrial%20Automation%20%28SMAC%29](Industrial Automation) in order to get the Planetary Transit System; getting a tech that is otherwise not on that beeline will simply delay your tech advance towards it (the cost of each tech is increased according to the number of techs you already know), so a random tech is less valuable than the opportunity to speed up this important swing Secret Project. Once the Planetary Transit System has been completed, feel free to cash in any extra alien artifacts for techs or another Secret Project.
