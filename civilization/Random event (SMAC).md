# Random event (SMAC)

[Planet%20%28SMAC%29](Planet) is a mysterious and complex system. It constantly produces new and unexpected means to discomfit and endanger humanity, but it can also capriciously produce surprising blessings. 
The influence of Planet's suns and moons may provoke a burst of [Mind%20Worms%20%28SMAC%29](mind worm) activity, or solar flares may increase [Energy%20%28SMAC%29](energy) stores while disrupting [Diplomacy%20%28SMAC%29](diplomatic communications), or you may discover an unexpected store of extra [Resource%20%28SMAC%29](resources) near a [Base%20%28SMAC%29](base), or an alien plague may break out. The effects of random events range from windfalls to disasters. Some events directly affect your [Factions%20%28SMAC%29](faction), others affect other factions, and many affect all of Planet indiscriminately.
Some events happen instantaneously; others last for several years. Negative random events can sometimes be avoided (for example, plagues are far less likely to break out in bases with [Biology%20Lab%20%28SMAC%29](Biology Lab) [Base%20facility%20%28SMAC%29](facilities)), but most just have to be ridden out, for better or worse.
The only thing that can be reliably said about natural phenomenon on Planet is it's always safest to expect the unexpected.
Random events can by turned off in the game configuration options.
