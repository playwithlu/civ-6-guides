# Liberty (Civ5)/Civilopedia

As a policy, liberty can be defined as the basic assumption that a nation's citizens deserve to be free. Free from physical restraint, and free from despotic control. Serfs, slaves, and hereditary servants do not enjoy liberty, nor do citizens who are forced to live within a certain village or gulag or ghetto.
