# Brandenburg Class (Civ5)/Civilopedia

The German Brandenburg-class of pre-dreadnoughts, the first being commissioned in 1893 AD, were intended to be an interim stage of design between large coastal ironclads and ocean-going battleships. Heavily armored and armed with six 11-inch heavy guns, four ships were eventually launched. The class saw action as far afield as China during the Boxer Rebellion and the Mediterranean during World War I before being sold off or scrapped.
