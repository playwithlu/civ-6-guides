# Spaceship (Civ4)

The "[Civilization%20IV](Civilization IV)" [Victory%20%28Civ4%29%23Space%20Race](Space Race Victory) can be achieved by building a spaceship and sending it to [Alpha%20Centauri%20%28star%20system%29](Alpha Centauri). The spaceship consists of the following parts:
In [vanilla](vanilla) and ' it is enough to just build the ship and launch it. ' changes this significantly: as in "[Sid%20Meier%27s%20Civilization](Civilization)" and "[Civilization%20II](Civilization II)", it is not enough to just launch the spaceship; it must also reach Alpha Centauri before anyone else's does. This is made more interesting by having the player make choices: the player can build more thrusters to make the ship travel faster and more casings to increase the probability of success for the mission. This involves an interface issue: when a new component is completed a screen is shown where the component can be installed. This screen should show the success probability of the mission but it does not. The screen does, however, have the launch-button. The success probability must be read separately through the Victory Conditions screen.
