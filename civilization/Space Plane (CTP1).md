Using Smart Materials to create the first truly reusable yet dependable launch vehicle, the Space Plane provides the comfort of an airline with the dependability of a Swiss clock. Smart Materials radically altered the cost of space flight by reducing vehicle weight and by increasing safety. Created with metals that actively resist high stress and that report stress fractures before failing, the Space Plane offers a better cargo-to-cost ratio than any previous spacecraft. Even more critical for commercial flights, it nearly guarantees that passengers survive the flight.
