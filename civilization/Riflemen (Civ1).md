# Riflemen (Civ1)

Riflemen are an enduring defensive unit.
Civilopedia entry.
Riflemen were a refinement of Musketeers. The rifle was a better weapon, accurate at many times the distance of a musket. With the dawning of long-standing, conscripted armies, the rifle meant even more difficulties for the attacker. First employed in large numbers during the American Civil War, the rifle gave the defense a strong advantage. A Rifleman could fire several times while the attackers advanced, and this was normally enough to hold any position. The Rifleman's advantage was to last, for the most part, until the appearance of Armor.
