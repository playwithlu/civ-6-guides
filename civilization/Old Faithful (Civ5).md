# Old Faithful (Civ5)

Old Faithful is a [Natural%20wonder%20%28Civ5%29](natural wonder) in "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)". It spawns in [Grassland%20%28Civ5%29](grassland), [Plains%20%28Civ5%29](plains), [Tundra%20%28Civ5%29](tundra), and [Mountain%20%28Civ5%29](mountain) tiles.
Strategy.
Old Faithful is a deceptively useful natural wonder: it offers only a +2 bonus if worked, but provides +3 just for being in your [Territory%20%28Civ5%29](territory). However, considering how rare bonuses are in the early game, a [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilization) that acts quickly could make good use of this wonder.
Old Faithful also counts as a mountain for purposes and purposes of building an [Observatory%20%28Civ5%29](Observatory). Only [Helicopter%20Gunship%20%28Civ5%29](Helicopter Gunships) can enter its tile, and they sustain damage if left there as if it were a mountain.
