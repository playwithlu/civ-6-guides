# Jet Fighter (Civ3)

Jet Fighters are faster versions of their predecessor. They may execute all air missions except precision strikes. Jet Fighters have radar that allows the unit to "see" two squares regardless of blocking terrain. They may be based in any city or aircraft carrier on the map.
A [City%20%28Civ3%29](city) needs oil and aluminum in its Strategic Resource box to build a jet fighter.
