# Metal Casting (Civ4)

Strategy.
"Boosts production and naval power."
Metal Casting allows you to build [Forge%20%28Civ4%29](Forges) and enables your [Worker%20%28Civ4%29](Workers) to build [Workshop%20%28Civ4%29](Workshop) improvements, both of which increase city production. Metal Casting also allows Triremes to be trained and enables the [Colossus%20%28Civ4%29](Colossus) wonder.
