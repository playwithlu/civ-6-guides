Civilopedia entry.
The contrivance of a previously unknown device, method, or process is known as an Invention. The advance of technical knowledge is essentially the discovery of new Inventions. The history of civilization shows that the spread of Literacy and the rise of Engineering specialists were critical to the acceleration of new technology. Engineering is the practical employment of Invention, and people who do this work are often the ones who identify the need for further advance and achieve it. The progress of a society is a measure of how well it encourages and adapts new Inventions.
