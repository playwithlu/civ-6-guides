# F7 (C-evo)

"[F7](F7)" is the keyboard function key used in the free-to-play game [C-evo](C-evo) to display in a pop-up window The s of the World. 
Neatly arranged icons have The [Colossus](Colossus) (the one that makes the others cheaper) in the centre, six others around it, and the remaining twelve around those, with the very important [Eiffel%20Tower](Eiffel Tower) at the bottom - the one that supports those that would otherwise be obsolete.
Click one to see its Manual pop-up page.
Mouse-over gives you name, city, and nation for each existing wonder, but destroyed wonders are in black.
The display may be reached also from the menu opened by a click on the government building icon near the bottom right of the map.
