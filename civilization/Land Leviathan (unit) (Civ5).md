# Land Leviathan (unit) (Civ5)

Game Info.
Most advanced landship unit. Strong against other land units, but weak against airships.
Strategy.
The Land Leviathan is the pinnacle of landship units, bringing devastation to any other land unit. Use it to destroy vulnerable enemy Anti-Air Guns and ensure your air units stay safe. Its armor will help protect it against the smaller guns of [Flyer%20%28Civ5%29](Flyers), but it is still vulnerable to cannon fire from [Airship%20%28Civ5%29](Airships) and [Sky%20Fortress%20%28unit%29%20%28Civ5%29](Sky Fortresses). It is best to protect the expensive Land Leviathan with units that are strong against air units, such as Flyers and Anti-Air Guns.
