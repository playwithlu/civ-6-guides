# Palace (Civ4)

Strategy.
The Palace is a special that defines the location of a [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ4](civilization's) [Capital%20%28Civ4%29](capital). In addition, it is a powerful [List%20of%20buildings%20in%20Civ4](building) in its own right, producing [Culture%20%28Civ4%29](culture), [Happiness%20%28Civ4%29](happiness), [Espionage%20%28Civ4%29](espionage), and [Commerce%20%28Civ4%29](commerce).
Unlike other national wonders, the Palace may be moved. When a civilization founds its first [City%20%28Civ4%29](city), it gets its Palace there for free. After that founding, the Palace cannot be built elsewhere until the civilization has at least six cities. Then the Palace may be moved to another city by building it there. When a new Palace is completed, the old one is removed.
When a civ loses its capital, a new capital is chosen from among its remaining cities, and a new Palace is built there for free.
The city with the Palace is marked with a gold star icon next to the city's name in the city screen.
