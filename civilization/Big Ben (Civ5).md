# Big Ben (Civ5)

Game Info.
Requires [Commerce%20%28Civ5%29](Commerce). ({{BNW}})
Strategy.
Big Ben is an especially useful Wonder for {{Gold5}}-oriented nations such as the [Arabian%20%28Civ5%29](Arabs) and the [Venetian%20%28Civ5%29](Venetians), because it can put all the extra {{Gold5}} they have lying around to use in developing [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities) (by buying [Building%20%28Civ5%29](buildings)) or developing their military (by buying [Unit%20%28Civ5%29](units)). It also helps further accumulation of {{Gold5}} through its secondary bonuses and the [Great%20Merchant%20%28Civ5%29](Great Merchant) points.
Combined with Commerce's [Mercantilism%20%28Civ5%29](Mercantilism) policy and Autocracy's [Mobilization%20%28Civ5%29](Mobilization) tenet, you can purchase units for 73% less {{Gold5}} than normal. This is very useful for late-game warmongers like [German%20%28Civ5%29](Germany), [American%20%28Civ5%29](America), and [Japanese%20%28Civ5%29](Japan).
