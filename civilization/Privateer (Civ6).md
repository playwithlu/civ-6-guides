# Privateer (Civ6)

The Privateer is a [Renaissance%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Renaissance Era) [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Naval%20raider](naval raider unit) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
The Privateer is a revolutionary unit for two reasons:
The Privateer is a true representation of the sea pirates of real history: quick, shadowy ships which appear to terrorize peaceful merchants and coastal colonies, then disappear. Its greatest strength is its invisibility; if its commander is careful, the Privateer may slip unnoticed into enemy waters and wreak havoc on their infrastructure! Its Coastal Raid ability can become a true nightmare for the enemy, with the Privateer appearing out of nowhere, [Combat%20%28Civ6%29%23Pillaging](pillaging) [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](improvements) and s, then disappearing into the nearby sea. To perform a Coastal Raid, the Privateer must be next to the land improvement or district, and must have at least 3 points remaining.
The Privateer's fighting capabilities are also great. But while stronger than the [Caravel%20%28Civ6%29](Caravel) (due to being a ranged unit), it is outclassed by the [Frigate%20%28Civ6%29](Frigate) in both ranged and melee combat. So, when faced with Frigates, try to use hit-and-run attacks to put them off-course. In general, try to avoid fights unless you have a clear advantage, and are attacking solitary ships.
