# Government systems

In the first games of the "Civilization" franchise choosing a government system was a simple choice between a few high level options, such as communism and democracy. This mechanism was rigid and eventually evolved into [civics](civics) in "[Civilization%20IV](Civilization IV)" and later into [social%20policies](social policies) in "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)".
