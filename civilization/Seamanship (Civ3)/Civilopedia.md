# Seamanship (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Mediterranean and Atlantic trade required European and Islamic civilizations to build on the seafaring advances 
achieved by their forefathers. Still, most improvements over the Roman galley were incremental, not revolutionary. 
Major advances in seamanship would not occur until the Renaissance, when the great trading cities of Venice and Genoa 
would devise new galley designs and look beyond the Mediterranean. Conversely, the Middle Ages saw a thriving seaborne 
trade between the Islamic dynasties and India; this contributed vastly to the sultans' wealth, as nations both Christian 
and Muslim devoured the spices, perfumes, and minerals found in the East. Islamic trade would dominate until the Age of 
Discovery in Europe.
