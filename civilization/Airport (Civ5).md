# Airport (Civ5)

Game Info.
Advanced tourism building.
Strategy.
The Airport is a great strategic addition to the late game. First, it is a must for [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilizations) that pursue a [Cultural%20victory%20%28Civ5%29](cultural victory), thanks to the additional output it provides. But even more importantly, it allows airlifting, a new action which is essentially the instantaneous [Movement%20%28Civ5%29](movement) of [Unit%20%28Civ5%29](units) between [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities) with Airports. It doesn't matter where these cities are; they can be on two opposite sides of the [Map%20%28Civ5%29](map)! Airlifting represents in a wonderful way the ultimate stage of modern transport, which was until now somewhat lacking in the game: citizen air travel enhances , while military travel allows you to transport your entire army in the blink of an eye.
