# Yoriki Law (Civ3)/Civilopedia

The concept of a police force operating independently of the military goes back to the Praetorian Guard of ancient 
Rome. In the Middle Ages, noblemen protected their estates by appointing constables to enforce the law and to arrest 
and guard criminals, but the first modern, organized police force was the London Metropolitan Police.
