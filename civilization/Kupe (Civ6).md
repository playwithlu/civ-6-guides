# Kupe (Civ6)

Kupe was a semi-legendary Māori explorer, navigator and who, according to some sources of Māori oral history and mythology, sailed from the legendary Māori homeland of and discovered and first settled the North Island of , nowadays [New%20Zealand](New Zealand). He leads the [M%C4%81ori%20%28Civ6%29](Māori) in "".
As the only civilization that starts with access to [Ocean%20%28Civ6%29](ocean) navigation, the Māori have a unique opportunity to choose a desirable [Coastal%20%28Civ6%29](coastal) homeland that they can cherish and protect.
In-Game.
Kupe's unique [Agenda%20%28Civ6%29](agenda) is Kaitiakitanga. He respects the environment and likes leaders who do the same.
His [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader ability) is Kupe's Voyage. He begins the game in an Ocean [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tile) and receives +2 {{Science6}} and {{Culture6}} per turn prior to founding his first [City%20%28Civ6%29](city). He receives a free [Builder%20%28Civ6%29](Builder) and +1 {{Citizen6}} Population when he founds his first city, and his [Palace%20%28Civ6%29](Palace) provides +3 {{Housing6}} and +1 {{Amenity6}}.
Detailed Approach.
The Mа̄ori start the game with Kupe leading them on their voyage across the sea from their mythical homeland of Hawaiki. They must scout for a choice spot to settle and then use their powerful initial city to get caught up quickly. They tread gently on the environment, avoiding clearing forests and harvesting [Resource%20%28Civ6%29](resources), but getting strong yields immediately from coastal and woodland resources. Upon unlocking the [Toa%20%28Civ6%29](Toa), they should make sure their empire is well-defended with a series of [P%C4%81%20%28Civ6%29](Pа̄) fortresses; set up effectively they make any attempt at attacking the Maori exceptionally costly. Kupe can be extremely powerful on Terra [Map%20%28Civ6%29](maps), since he can settle the player-less continent at the beginning of the game and settle to his heart's content.
