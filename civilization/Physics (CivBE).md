In-Universe information.
Just as the study of biology and chemistry, physics also took unexpected new turns after arriving on this wonderful new planet. The discovery of the likes of Firaxite and Floatstone turned many concepts upside down, and forced reevaluation of whole branches of the science. Even in the realm of 'classical physics' - mechanics, optics, acoustics, thermodynamics and magnetism - new discoveries were made daily, ushering exciting times for all physicists. While Atomics and Nuclear physicists stepped back, Particle and Quantum physicists took the front stage with excellent developments. Even Astrophysics entered a new Golden Era as colonists established themselves and looked back up to space. 
Through it all, colonial engineers worked closely with physicists to create gadgets big and small and put these new visions into practice. Thus was our new home created and a place for our species carved out of a hostile alien landscape.
