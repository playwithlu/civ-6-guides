# Map (Civ6)

The map is the world on which a game of "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)" takes place. The map consists of a rectangular set of [hex](hex)agonal [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles), with sections of terrestrial land divided into [Continent%20%28Civ6%29](continents). The map may be generated with various map scripts, and comes in six sizes.
In most cases, the map will be cylindrical with wraparound on an eastâ€“west axis, with impassible [Ice%20%28Civ6%29](ice caps) at the northern and southern edges. However, there are some map scripts, such as Inland Sea, that do not feature wraparound, with hard borders on all four edges.
Map scripts.
Maps can be randomly generated through scripts. These scripts arrange the continental land and open sea into various configurations, with extra settings in [Starting%20a%20new%20game%20%28Civ6%29%23Advanced%20Setup](Advanced Setup) to further modify how land is generated.
[Vanilla](Vanilla) "Civilization VI" allows players to choose from eight different types of maps, with more added by [DLC%20%28Civ6%29](DLC) and [Updates%20%28Civ6%29](update).
Map size.
As mentioned above, "Civilization VI" separates maps into six distinct sizes. The size of a map determines the default and maximum numbers of players and city-states, the maximum number of [Religion%20%28Civ6%29](religions) that can be founded, and also the number of [Natural%20wonder%20%28Civ6%29](natural wonders) and continents, as shown in the table below.
Regardless of map size, the minimum numbers of players and city-states are 2 and 0, respectively.
