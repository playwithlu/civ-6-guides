# Landship (Civ5)/Empires of the Smoky Skies

Game Info.
More powerful version of the [Land%20Ironclad%20%28Civ5%29](Land Ironclad). Strong against other land units, but weak against airships.
Strategy.
The Landship is heavily armored and excels at ground combat. Use it to defeat other land units and wear down cities for capture. Its armor will help protect it against the smaller guns of [Flyer%20%28Civ5%29](Flyers), but it is vulnerable to cannon fire from Airships. Escort the Landship with units that are strong against air units, such as Flyers and Anti-Air Guns, for maximum survivability.
