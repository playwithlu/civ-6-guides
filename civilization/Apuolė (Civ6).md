Because the player cannot obtain s in Vikings, Traders, and Raiders!, it is not possible to interact with Apuolė diplomatically. As such, the city-state does not provide any or [Suzerain%20%28Civ6%29](Suzerain) bonuses.
Apuolė, being one of the two city-states located directly on the alongside [W%C3%B2lin%20%28Civ6%29/Vikings%2C%20Traders%2C%20and%20Raiders%21](Wòlin), is an obvious target for [Swedish%20%28Civ6%29/Vikings%2C%20Traders%2C%20and%20Raiders%21](Sweden) and [Danish%20%28Civ6%29](Denmark). As Sweden, Apuolė will likely be your first military conquest, due to its proximity with your easternmost settlements and allowing you to be able to focus on fighting [Barbarian%20%28Civ6%29](barbarians) so you can expand into . As Denmark, Apuolė could potentially be a worthwhile expedition, since if you have conquered Wòlin they will be the closest target for your army and allowing you to forward-settle Sweden.
