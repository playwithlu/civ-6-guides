# Industry (Civ6)

The Industry is a special [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](tile improvement) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is exclusive to the [Monopolies%20and%20Corporations%20%28Civ6%29](Monopolies and Corporations) [Game%20mode%20%28Civ6%29](game mode), introduced in the [Vietnam%20%26amp%3B%20Kublai%20Khan%20Pack%20%28Civ6%29](Vietnam &amp; Kublai Khan Pack). It can be built on any [Resource%20%28Civ6%29%23Luxury](luxury resource) which a player already owns two improved copies of.
Strategy.
The Industry is the new improvement around which the entire Monopolies and Corporations game mode is built. This unique improvement has a few quirks of which players should be aware:
When an Industry is placed, if the resource is already improved with another improvement, the existing improvement will be removed. Since some standard improvements grant 2 as the base yield and scale with [Technology%20%28Civ6%29](technology) and [Civic%20%28Civ6%29](civic) progression and the Industry grants only 1 without scaling, it's possible that the tile will lose yields when the existing improvement gets upgraded into an Industry.
Mechanics.
The below table lists all of the bonuses that each luxury grants to its host city once it has been improved with an Industry.
