# Carthage (Civ6)

Carthage is a militaristic [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-state) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Under rulesets in which [Phoenician%20%28Civ6%29](Phoenicia) is a playable [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization), Carthage becomes a [Phoenician%20cities%20%28Civ6%29](Phoenician city) and is replaced with [Ngazargamu%20%28Civ6%29](Ngazargamu).
Strategy.
Carthage's bonuses focus on a civilization's [Encampment%20%28Civ6%29](Encampments), including its [Suzerain%20%28Civ6%29](Suzerain) bonus, which provides additional s for each Encampment in your civilization in [vanilla](vanilla) "Civilization VI".
In "", Carthage provides a whopping 60% discount on purchasing land [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](units) in [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) with all three Encampment [Building%20%28Civ6%29](buildings), which is a late-game dream for any civilization whether it's used for attacking or defending. If you have good income and at least one Encampment in one of your cities, becoming Suzerain of this city-state should be a high priority.
Despite the in-game description, it also gives a discount on purchases of land combat units, including [Nihang%20%28Civ6%29](Nihangs). This synergizes well with the [Grand%20Master%27s%20Chapel%20%28Civ6%29](Grand Master's Chapel) and [Lahore%20%28Civ6%29](Lahore).
