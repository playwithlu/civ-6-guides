# Turtles (Civ6)

Strategy.
Late in the game, {{TurtlesIcon6}} Turtles improved with [Fishing%20Boats%20%28Civ6%29](Fishing Boats) will provide +2 {{Food6}} and +1 {{Gold6}} in addition to the yields of the Reefs in which they are found. They also provide a small bonus to {{Science6}}, and are one of the few resources that do so.
