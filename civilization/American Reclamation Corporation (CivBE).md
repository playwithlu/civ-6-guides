ARC Strategies.
""Because Espionage is a good early source of Energy, buying Units and Buildings can be a bigger part of the early game with ARC. Over time ARC's Espionage bonus opens up further Science Covert Ops, which they should be able to reach faster than other Factions. ARC should try to leverage the early Energy surplus into faster growth, and prepare to switch from an Energy heavy economy to a Science heavy economy for the mid-game."
There are Virtues that have Espionage bonuses, such as Information Warfare which allows you to recruit an extra Agent. Because of this, as well as all the general use value available from Virtues/Culture, Culture can be an important aspect of ARC gameplay." (http://apolyton.net)"
