# Forest Fire (Civ6)

A Forest Fire is a [Disasters%20%28Civ6%29](natural disaster) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)", introduced in the [Maya%20%26amp%3B%20Gran%20Colombia%20Pack%20%28Civ6%29](Maya &amp; Gran Colombia Pack). When it occurs, a [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tile) with [Woods%20%28Civ6%29](Woods) or [Rainforest%20%28Civ6%29](Rainforest) catches fire, which may later spread to nearby tiles with the same [Terrain%20%28Civ6%29%23Terrain%20features](feature). Any tile with these features is vulnerable, whether or not it has additional [Resource%20%28Civ6%29](resources) or [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](improvements).
Progression.
Forest Fires burn for 3 [turn](turn)s. On the second and third turns, the fire has a 50% chance to spread to any adjacent Woods or Rainforest tiles. [River%20%28Civ6%29](Rivers) do not prevent the fire from spreading, and fires do not spread from Woods to Rainforest or vice versa (which is important to remember when planning to use [Soothsayer%20%28Civ6%29](Soothsayers) to fertilize tiles).
Once the fire has burned out, the Woods and Rainforest is replaced with a Burnt variant, boosting the tile's yield by 1. Over the next 3 turns, it regrows until it returns to its normal state, at which point it also boosts the tile's yield by 1. Note that Fertilization affects the tile, not the feature, so chopping the Woods/Rainforest will not remove the bonus yields from the tile.
Note that Burning and Burnt Woods and Rainforests are distinct terrain features, so effects that apply to regular Woods and Rainforests (such as bonuses, [Adjacency%20bonus%20%28Civ6%29](adjacency bonuses), [Brazilian%20%28Civ6%29](Brazil's) [List%20of%20civilization%20abilities%20in%20Civ6](civilization ability), [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Recon](recon units') [Sentry%20%28Civ6%29](Sentry) [Promotion%20%28Civ6%29](promotion), and the [Highlander%20%28Civ6%29](Highlander's) combat bonus) don't apply to them.
Strategy.
To counter Forest Fires, you can shape forested areas into smaller clusters or have [Builder%20%28Civ6%29](Builders) nearby to remove features in key locations when a fire breaks out. [Liang%20%28Surveyor%29%20%28Civ6%29](Liang) with [Reinforced%20Materials%20%28Civ6%29](Reinforced Materials), when established in a city, will prevent Forest Fires from spreading within its [Borders%20%28Civ6%29](borders). You could, in theory, also choose which city loses the Population by swapping tiles between cities where possible.
In the [Apocalypse%20%28Civ6%29](Apocalypse) [Game%20mode%20%28Civ6%29](game mode), Forest Fires can be summoned by a Soothsayer standing on a tile with Woods or Rainforest.
