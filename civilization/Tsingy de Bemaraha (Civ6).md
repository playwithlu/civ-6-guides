# Tsingy de Bemaraha (Civ6)

Tsingy de Bemaraha is a single-tile impassable {{Link6|Natural Wonder}} in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". Tsingy de Bemaraha occupies a {{Link6|Grassland}}, {{Link6|Plains}}, or {{Link6|Tundra}} tile, and provides +1 {{Culture6}}, +1 {{Science6}}, and +2 {{Link6|Appeal}} to each adjacent tile.
In "", discovering Tsingy de Bemaraha grants +1 [Era%20Score%20%28Civ6%29](Era Score), or +3 Score if the player is the first to do so.
Strategy.
Like other impassable wonders, the Tsingy de Bemaraha wonder tile offers no benefits, and cannot be developed or improved. However, its tile provides +1 {{Culture6}} and +1 {{Science6}} to up to six adjacent tiles; these yields are cumulatively worth considerably more than the dead tile. It is usually worth incorporating single-tile wonders within city borders to maximize their yields.
Similarly to other Natural Wonders, the Appeal bonus of Tsingy de Bemaraha is also ideal for building {{Link6|Neighborhoods}}, and is useful when founding {{Link6|National Parks}}.
