# Bugs (Civ5)

Bugs are coding mistakes that cause errors during [gameplay](gameplay). Some of the bugs once present in "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)" have been fixed in official patches such as the [October%202014%20patch%20%28Civ5%29](October 2014 patch); others, however, remain in the final version of the game.
Some bugs can be patched with [Modding%20%28Civ5%29](mods).
List of bugs.
Crashes to desktop.

Upon gaining a city with a [Military%20unit%20%28Civ5%29](military unit) on its tile in a [Diplomacy%20%28Civ5%29%23War%20and%20Peace](peace deal), the center tile ceases to be worked.
Atomic Bombs immune to interception.
The [Atomic%20Bomb%20%28Civ5%29](Atomic Bomb) is delivered by a bomber with a 50% evasion chance, but is impossible to intercept.
Unobtainable Great Works of Music.
The [Great%20Musician%20%28Civ5%29](Great Musician) Mirabai creates a copy of "Nin Me Schara" instead of "Payoji Maine," and the Great Musician Mikhail Mishaqah never appears in the game. This makes two [Great%20Work%20%28Civ5%29%23Great%20Musicians](Great Works of Music) - Mirabai's "Payoji Maine" and Mikhail Mishaqah's "Dervish Tune" - impossible to obtain.
