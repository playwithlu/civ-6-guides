# Film Studio (Civ6)

The Film Studio is a [Unique%20building%20%28Civ6%29](unique) [Building%20%28Civ6%29](building) of the [American%20%28Civ6%29](American) [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is built in the [Theater%20Square%20%28Civ6%29](Theater Square) [District%20%28Civ6%29](district) and replaces the [Broadcast%20Center%20%28Civ6%29](Broadcast Center).
Strategy.
The Film Studio is a unique building that plays to one of America's greatest strengths. Any city that builds it doubles its output to civilizations that have reached the Modern Era, allowing the Americans to catapult toward a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Culture Victory) in the later stages of the game. With the [Satellite%20Broadcasts%20%28Civ6%29](Satellite Broadcasts) [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](policy card), a city with a Film Studio and some or all of the [Wonder%20%28Civ6%29](wonders) that hold Great Works of Music (the [Bolshoi%20Theatre%20%28Civ6%29](Bolshoi Theatre), [Broadway%20%28Civ6%29](Broadway), and the [Sydney%20Opera%20House%20%28Civ6%29](Sydney Opera House)) can become a world-class tourist destination.
Whether you're playing the [vanilla](vanilla) version of the game or the expansions (i.e., with or without World Eras), the Film Studio doubles your output only against civilizations that have discovered at least one Modern Era [Technology%20%28Civ6%29](technology) or [Civic%20%28Civ6%29](civic). Therefore, this is a rare unique building that is pointless to rush, since its uniqueness is based on a condition that you don't have to satisfy. Overall, you are much better off entering the Modern Era from the bottom half of the tech tree rather than the top half - more specifically, you should enter the [Era%20%28Civ6%29](era) with [Steel%20%28Civ6%29](Steel). This will maximize your chances of getting the [Eiffel%20Tower%20%28Civ6%29](Eiffel Tower), which is an extremely powerful wonder in the hands of [Teddy%20Roosevelt%20%28Civ6%29](Teddy Roosevelt) and will also boost [Flight%20%28Civ6%29](Flight) (the prerequisite for [Radio%20%28Civ6%29](Radio)) when constructed.
