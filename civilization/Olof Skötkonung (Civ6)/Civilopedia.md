# Olof Skötkonung (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Olof III – born Olof Eiriksson (son of Erik VII Bjornsson, “king” of the Svear, better known today as Sweden) and occasionally known as Olof Skotkonung – spent the best years of his life fighting King Tryggvason of Norway. Gaining the throne of Sweden in 993 AD, what historians know of Olof is based on the accounts of Snorri Sturluson and Adam of Bremen.
According to Adam, Sweyn Forkbeard was forced to defend his Danish throne from Olof’s claims, but that squabble was resolved soon enough when Sweyn married Olof’s mother, Sigrid “the Haughty.” Besides, according to Snorri, they both soon made common cause to defeat the Norwegian king Olav Tryggvason at the naval battle of Svolder in either 999 or 1000 (Snorri not being so certain of the year, but did know the month was September). Sweyn and Olof thereafter divided Norway between themselves.
His efforts to bring the other Swedes to the light did not go quite as well. Converted to Christianity by St. Sigfrid c. 1008, Olof attempted to force the new faith on his subjects. It didn’t go so well, according to Adam, as he was martyred in Stockholm by rebel jarls c. 1021 when he refused to make a sacrifice to pagan idols.
