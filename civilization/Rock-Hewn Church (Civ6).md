Strategy.
Maximizing generation is the key to Ethiopia's strategy under [Menelik%20II%20%28Civ6%29](Menelik II), and the Rock-Hewn Church helps considerably with these efforts. A single one can provide up to +7 if surrounded by Hills and/or Mountains, which also translates to +1.05 and bonuses for a [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) founded on Hills. Once [Flight%20%28Civ6%29](Flight) is researched, it starts providing equal to its tile's bonus (including any bonuses from [Pantheon%20%28Civ6%29](pantheons) and being adjacent to a [Natural%20wonder%20%28Civ6%29](natural wonder) or a [Nazca%20Line%20%28Civ6%29](Nazca Line)), and its Appeal bonus can help create better places for [National%20Park%20%28Civ6%29](National Parks) and [Seaside%20Resort%20%28Civ6%29](Seaside Resorts).
The Rock-Hewn Church helps spur the Ethiopians toward a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Cultural Victory), especially if they use their accumulated to purchase [Archaeological%20Museum%20%28Civ6%29](Archaeological Museums) and [Archaeologist%20%28Civ6%29](Archaeologists) to fill them with Artifacts. Even if a Cultural Victory isn't their first choice, just the sheer output of this improvement plays very well into the Ethiopian toolkit, both for the additional and and quickly summoning a large army if they adopt [Theocracy%20%28Civ6%29](Theocracy) or build the [Grand%20Master%27s%20Chapel%20%28Civ6%29](Grand Master's Chapel).
In "", the Rock-Hewn Church cannot be removed from tiles by [Disaster%20%28Civ6%29](natural disasters), making it ideal for improving the tiles around active [Volcano%20%28Civ6%29](Volcanoes).
