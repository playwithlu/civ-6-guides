# Difficulty level (C-evo)

The free-to-play game "[C-evo](C-evo)" has several difficulty levels, as do most games covered by this wiki. The opening screens have an option for five named classes of difficulty and an option for setting difficulty levels for individual [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20C-evo](nations).
Manual settings.
The option, "Free Player Setup", lets you set levels for all nations specifically: you can specify the level of difficulty for each nation (from one bar - about 25% easier than standard - to three bars - 25% harder). Those levels can be numbered 1, 2, and 3 for convenience in later paragraphs of this article and others.
Automatic classes.
Thus your percentage of the rivals' requirements goes in a near-geometric progression 50, 75, 100, 133, 167.
Effects.
A nation's difficulty level determines the numbers it needs for food to grow, for building units or buildings or wonders, and for research. 
The first two are simple proportions; for example, the food box needs 30, 40, or 50, and some building work, such as Town Hall, Barracks, and Temple, uses the same numbers, with other buildings, units, and wonders using the same 25% discount or surcharge on their basic costs. (Wonders enjoy a further 25% discount if you own The Colossus.)
Research has a more complicated formula.
- where n is initially 4 and increases by 2 or 1 for each advance discovered or acquired
