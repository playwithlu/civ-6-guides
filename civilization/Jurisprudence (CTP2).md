Jurisprudence, the study of law, existed since the earliest iterations of society, since the stability of a society often rested on the rules governing conduct. One of the earliest known sets of laws, Hammurabi's Code covered matters ranging from criminal law to taxation and property laws. The most complex system of laws in the ancient world belonged to the Romans. Under the emperor Justinian, all laws were collected and organized to form the Roman Civil Law that shaped the foundation of many modern legal systems.
