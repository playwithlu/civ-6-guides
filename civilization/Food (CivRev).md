# Food (CivRev)

Food is somewhat vital in all "[Civilization%20%28series%29](Civilization)" games and [Sid%20Meier](Sid Meier's) new release in 2008, "[Civilization%20Revolution](Civilization Revolution)", is no exception.
Food.
Food feeds the many citizens of your [City%20%28CivRev%29](cities), but luxury comes at a price, as it is also grown by them too. When a city is built, some surrounding tiles will have little apple icons on them showing the areas of which food can be grown. Certain [List%20of%20buildings%20in%20CivRev](buildings) ([Aqueduct%20%28CivRev%29](Aqueducts), [Harbor%20%28CivRev%29](Harbors) and [Granary%20%28CivRev%29](Granaries)) can boost the production of food in these tiles from 1 food per tile to as much as 3 or 4 food production on every food tile!
Turns (Food).
Food is produced every turn and automatically feeds the many citizens of your cities. More and more citizens arrive after a [Population%20growth%20%28CivRev%29](population growth) every 9 or 10 turns. Population growths occur fairly regularly at the beginning of the game but start to become less frequent towards the [Medieval%20Era%20%28CivRev%29](Medieval Era). Houses will automatically appear as will citizens at the beginning of the game and will continue to appear or upgrade as the course of time is followed.
Growing Food.
Growing food is much more simple in this installment of the "Civilization" series than in some others such as "[CivWorld](CivWorld)". Food is automatically grown and dispersed to the citizens of your city and still doesn't cost you a penny. But "free food" is not really the correct approach:
Food is automatically grown and does not reduce your [Gold%20%28currency%29%20%28CivRev%29](gold) balance but it does require certain buildings to produce enough food to feed an ever-growing city.
Food Tiles.
Food tiles (although the visual aspect of "Civilization Revolution" does not consist of [tile](tile)s but of just land) are essentially just the areas inside each city's radius which can produce food for your city. Other tiles in a city consist of:
Finally, note that the [Egyptian%20%28CivRev%29](Egyptians) can also grow food on [Desert%20%28CivRev%29](deserts).
Bonus tiles.
Some tiles will produce extra food if they have an additional icon on them, usually of an animal or plant. These include [Fish%20%28CivRev%29](Fish), [Game%20%28CivRev%29](Game), [Whale%20%28CivRev%29](Whale) and [Wheat%20%28CivRev%29](Wheat).
