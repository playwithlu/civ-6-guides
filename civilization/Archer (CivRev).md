# Archer (CivRev)

The Archer is the first strong defensive unit in "[Civilization%20Revolution](Civilization Revolution)". It becomes available once the [List%20of%20technologies%20in%20CivRev](technology) [Bronze%20Working%20%28CivRev%29](Bronze Working) has been discovered.
Unit Analysis.
Archers cost the same as [Warrior%20%28CivRev%29](Warriors) (10 production), have the same attack and movement and double the [Defense%20%28CivRev%29](defense). This defense isn't met by an equal attack until the arrival of the [Legion%20%28CivRev%29](Legion).
These units, like the others in its lineage, are best used to defend [City%20%28CivRev%29](cities). They are also useful for defending borders if they are upgraded with perks such as [Loyalty%20%28CivRev%29](Loyalty) and [Guerrilla%20%28CivRev%29](Guerrilla).
Archers inside cities do not have to advance into spaces occupied by enemies they have attacked and defeated.
Unique Replacements.
[English%20%28CivRev%29](English) Archers are replaced by the Longbow Archer. Compared to the regular Archer, it has +1 defense from England's [Ancient%20Era%20%28CivRev%29](Ancient Era) [Bonus%20%28CivRev%29](bonus).
