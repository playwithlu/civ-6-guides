# Gold Ore (Civ6)/Outback Tycoon

 Gold Ore is a [Resource%20%28Civ6%29%23Luxury](luxury resource) from [Outback%20Tycoon%20%28Civ6%29](Outback Tycoon), a [List%20of%20scenarios%20in%20Civ6](scenario) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is found in [Desert%20%28Civ6%29](Desert) and [Plains%20%28Civ6%29](Plains) [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles) (including [Hills%20%28Civ6%29](Hills)).
Strategy.
In Outback Tycoon, making as much as possible is the name of the game, and the +4 bonus from Gold Ore helps with that considerably. If you see Gold Ore outside your borders, found a city near it as soon as possible, then have a [Prospector%20%28Civ6%29](Prospector) build a [Mine%20%28Civ6%29](Mine) to claim it as your own.
