# Support Cost (CTP2)

 is a game concept in "[Call%20to%20Power%20II](Call to Power II)".
Gameplay.
Waging war is not without its price. When a city builds a unit, the cost of that unit is measured in the resources it takes to build it. Once built, however, the unit incurs an additional cost of maintaining its health and training. This Military Support cost is extracted from the total output of an empire. The larger the military, the more strain on resources it has. 
Several things can affect Military Support costs, including type, and the Setting.
