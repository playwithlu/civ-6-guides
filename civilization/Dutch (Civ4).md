The Dutch people represent a [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ4](civilization) in "[Civilization%20IV](Civilization IV)".
Strategy.
With bonuses to Production, Culture and Commerce, the Dutch are the most balanced Builder civilization in the game. [Willem%20van%20Oranje%20%28Civ4%29](Willem van Oranje), a "[Financial%20%28Civ4%29](Financial)" and "[Creative%20%28Civ4%29](Creative)" [Leaders%20%28Civ4%29](leader), gives a major boost to Culture and Commerce in every [City%20%28Civ4%29](city) under his reign, while the [Dike%20%28Civ4%29](Dike), the Dutch replacement for the [Levee%20%28Civ4%29](Levee), provides a Production bonus from any water or river tile in a city radius. Throw in the most powerful transport ship until the discovery of the [Transport%20%28Civ4%29](Transport) - the [East%20Indiaman%20%28Civ4%29](East Indiaman) - and you've got a civilization that can spread from horizon to horizon with ease.
The unique unit and [Unique%20building%20%28Civ4%29](building) of the Dutch makes them ideal for sea-based empires, and the Financial [Leader%20trait%20%28Civ4%29](trait) of Willem van Oranje allows him to add to ocean commerce for a good rate of science. The Creative trait means that new [Coastal%20%28Civ4%29](coastal) cities will expand their borders quickly, and therefore be able to hold even more sea squares.
East Indiamen are ideal for setting up sea colonies abroad due to their higher strength and cargo space - there's also little danger from [Privateer%20%28Civ4%29](Privateers) as East Indiamen and Privateers have the same strength. This means Willem van Oranje can set up a large, sea-based empire ready for Dikes to come along to vastly improve production.
