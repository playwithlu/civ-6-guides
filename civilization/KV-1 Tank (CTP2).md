# KV-1 Tank (CTP2)

The KV-1 is one of two tanks that the Russians invented for the Global World War 2 mod for "[Call%20to%20Power%20II](Call to Power II)". The mod maker gave them a universal build option on his mod so these tanks are not restricted to just the Russian Civilization. In fact any nation can build them providing that civilization had discovered the Tank warfare technology.
