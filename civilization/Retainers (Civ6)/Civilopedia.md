# Retainers (Civ6)/Civilopedia

In the counterfeit feudalism that prevailed in the late Middle Ages, a society organized along lines of personal service being a “retainer” was the best method to obtain favor in the form of offices, land grants, gifts, and honors from those higher up the nobility chain. In return, the gentry helped fight their lord’s wars or put down rebellions. Not only did the gentry have to fight for the king themselves, but they were required to supply an agreed upon number of lesser nobles and knights as well. These personal retainers were known collectively as the “affinity” of the lord, akin to the celebrity “posses” of today … but more reliable.
