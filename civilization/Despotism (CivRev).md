# Despotism (CivRev)

Despotism is the default form of [Government%20%28CivRev%29](government) in "[Civilization%20Revolution](Civilization Revolution)" for the majority of [Civilizations%20%28CivRev%29](civilizations), excluding the [Arabian%20%28CivRev%29](Arabs) (who start with [Fundamentalism%20%28CivRev%29](Fundamentalism)), [Greek%20%28CivRev%29](Greeks) (who start with [Democracy%20%28government%29%20%28CivRev%29](Democracy)), [Roman%20%28CivRev%29](Romans) (who begin with a [Republic%20%28CivRev%29](Republic)), and [English%20%28CivRev%29](English) (who begin with knowledge of [Monarchy%20%28government%29%20%28CivRev%29](Monarchy)). The in-game description tells the player that under Despotism, "you rule with absolute power." It has no disadvantages and one advantage: using a [ICBM%20%28CivRev%29](nuclear weapon) does not harm the despot's [Culture%20%28CivRev%29](culture).
Despots will use the in-game title of "Lord" (if the [Leaders%20%28CivRev%29](leader) is male) or "Lady" (if the leader is female). Sometimes interacting with other leaders in-game while using Despotism will prompt them to remark that it is a "primitive" form of government.
