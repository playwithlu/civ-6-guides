# Leader (Civ3)

Leaders can arise when an elite unit wins a battle. The Leader may be used either to create an [Army%20%28Civ3%29](Army) or to hurry production in a [City%20%28Civ3%29](city), even a [Small%20Wonder%20%28Civ3%29](Small Wonder) or [List%20of%20wonders%20in%20Civ3](Great Wonder). When the Leader does either of these things it disappears.
The [Heroic%20Epic%20%28Civ3%29](Heroic Epic) increases the chances of Leaders appearing from battle.
"Conquests" Changes.
In the ' expansion, leaders are split into Military Leaders and Scientific Leaders"'. Military Leaders appear as a result of battle as described previously, while Scientific Leaders appear as a result of a civilization being the first to research a scientific breakthrough; civilizations with the strength have a higher chance to have these Leaders appear. Scientific Leaders cannot build an Army, but can be used to start an [Golden%20Age%20%28Civ3%29%23Scientific%20Golden%20Age](Age of Science). This feature, however, is broken in all versions of "[Civilization%20III](Civilization III)"; as such, it is better to use the Leader to rush a Great Wonder.
