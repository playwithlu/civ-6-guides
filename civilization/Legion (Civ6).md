The Legion is a [Unique%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](unique) [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Melee](melee unit) of the [Roman%20%28Civ6%29](Roman) [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It replaces the [Swordsman%20%28Civ6%29](Swordsman).

Strategy.
The Legion's raw strength and ability to create fortifications make it an invaluable tool in early-game expansion. Capturing multiple [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) in a single campaign becomes much easier, since defenses can be constructed immediately around a captured city. They can also repair damaged [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](tile improvements).
A different, very powerful, strategy is to use the Legion's ability to spend their build charge to chop [Woods%20%28Civ6%29](Woods). This allows the Legion to create a sort of chain reaction: train a Legion, then use its build charge to expedite the training of another Legion, and repeat until you run out of Woods (or in "Gathering Storm"). This can get you an extremely large early game army that can spell instant doom for your neighbors.
