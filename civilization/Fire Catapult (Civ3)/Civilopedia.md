# Fire Catapult (Civ3)/Civilopedia

The Fire Catapult can launch more powerful and more terrifying flaming projectiles. Such missiles
were often launched in hopes of setting fire to fortifications or buildings being employed by the
defenders. Flaming projectiles were also quite effective if successfully launched into a massed
group of enemy warriors.
