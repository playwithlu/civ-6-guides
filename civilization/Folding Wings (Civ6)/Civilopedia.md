# Folding Wings (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Even with hangar decks, things got crowded, especially when dive bombers were added to the aviation complement of the carriers in the 1930s. Since adding another hangar deck was impractical, naval “thinkers” turned to more radical solutions for packing more planes onto fleet carriers … and so folding wings were incorporated into new carrier plane designs. Despite the misgivings of some pilots (who weren’t real keen on the possibility of their wings folding up while aloft), aircraft such as the British Supermarine Spitfire and Fairy Gannet were soon aboard British carriers; by the late 1930s virtually all American carrier planes had been converted to folding wings. The Japanese ones too. Folding wings did mean more hydraulic and electrical maintenance chores, but the added planes seemed worth the trouble.
