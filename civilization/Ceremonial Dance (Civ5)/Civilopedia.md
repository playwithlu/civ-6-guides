# Ceremonial Dance (Civ5)/Civilopedia

Polynesian culture lacked a widespread indigenous written language, and was transmitted orally and through a variety of mnemonic methods, including ceremonial dance and singing. Dances varied from region to region in Polynesia. Ceremonial dances accompanied fertility rituals, were used to honor the gods, praise the chief and heroes, and greet esteemed visitors. Contact with the West often led to western instruments and musical styles being blended into existing dances.
The most famous Polynesian ceremonial dances are probably the Hula, developed on Hawaii, and the Maori Haka of New Zealand. Hula is famous for its undulating chants and gestures, and Haka for its energetic stamps, movement, and rhythmic chants. Hulas are classified into two broad categories: Ancient, referring to pre-Western contact, and called "kahiko", and a more modern style from the 19th and 20th centuries, called Auana. The Haka was danced by both Maori men and women, from occasions ranging from funerals to war.
Dancing is still an important part of Polynesian culture and taught throughout Polynesia, allowing future generations to experience the culture through the graceful motions and harmonies of its more peaceful manifestations, as well as the powerful, aggressive greetings of rugby teams.
