# Pyramids (Civ1)

Pyramids is a [List%20of%20wonders%20in%20Civ1](World Wonder) in "[Sid%20Meier%27s%20Civilization](Sid Meier's Civilization)". 
Strategy.
The Pyramids allow you to change your [Government%20%28Civ1%29](government) much earlier in the game than normal, allowing you to reap the benefits of [Democracy%20%28government%29%20%28Civ1%29](Democracy) early, assuming you can keep your citizens happy.
Because The Pyramids can unlock any government, it is much more advantages to avoid reserching [Communism%20%28Civ1%29](Communism), since you can already gain Communism with The Pyramids, alongside every other government.
The Pyramids are by far the best [List%20of%20wonders%20in%20Civ1](wonder) in the entirety of [Sid%20Meier%27s%20Civilization](Civ1), and should be a goal in almost every game.
Civilopedia entry.
Built by the fourth dynasty of Egyptian rulers on the Giza plateau outside modern-day Cairo, the Pyramids represent the pinnacle of ancient Egyptian cultural achievement. These Wonders were burial tombs and monuments for the Pharaohs and may have required generations and tens of thousands of workers to complete. They were ancient monuments when visited by Herodutus, centuries before the time of Christ. They are the only one of the generally accepted seven wonders of the ancient world that still stand. The construction of the Pyramids implied a highly stable government and well organized society.
