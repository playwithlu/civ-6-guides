# Warrior (Civ5)

Game Info.
First melee unit. Available right from the start of the game.
Strategy.
The Warrior is the earliest combat unit available without any [List%20of%20technologies%20in%20Civ5](technological) research. Armed with simple weapons like clubs and maces, it is useful for battling [Barbarian%20%28Civ5%29](barbarians), early [City%20%28Civ5%29](city) defense and limited exploration. Warriors are generally not strong enough to take enemy cities unless heavily supported by [Archer%20%28Civ5%29](Archers) and [Catapult%20%28Civ5%29](Catapults), and even then they may simply not have the strength for the task.
Notably, a Warrior will upgrade into a [Spearman%20%28Civ5%29](Spearman) if it receives a unit upgrade from an [Ancient%20Ruins%20%28Civ5%29](Ancient Ruins).
