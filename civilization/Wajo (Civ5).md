Strategy.
A Wajo is a special improvement that doesn't increase a hex's productivity or provide access to a resource. Instead, a Wajo inflicts 2 damage to enemy units who end their turn adjacent and it improves a hex's defensive bonus by 50% for units stationed in that hex. However, Wajos do not provide a defensive bonus to units in enemy territory.
