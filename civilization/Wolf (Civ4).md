# Wolf (Civ4)

The Wolf is a barbarian [Animal%20%28Civ4%29](animal) unit in "[Civilization%20IV](Civilization IV)".
Strategy.
Wolves are the weakest of the wild animals, but faster than [Lion%20%28Civ4%29](Lions) or [Bear%20%28Civ4%29](Bears). Like other animal units, they spawn only in the early game and cannot enter a civilization's cultural borders.
[Scout%20%28Civ4%29](Scouts) receive a 100% combat strength bonus when fighting Wolves. Be sure to protect any [Settler%20%28Civ4%29](Settlers) that leave your territory with Scouts or military units if Wolves are nearby.
