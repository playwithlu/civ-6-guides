# Combat (Civ3)

There are four types of combat: ground/naval combat, bombardment, missile attacks, and air combat.
Ground/Naval combat.
Ground/Naval combat occurs when [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ3](units) of different [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ3](civilizations) try to occupy the same square. The two units trade blows until one of them loses its health bar and is destroyed. The winner may be damaged (its health bar is reduced).
Bombardment.
Bombardment occurs when a ranged unit or [Air%20unit%20%28Civ3%29](air unit) attacks without entering the defender's square. Bombardment inflicts losses to the defender's health bar but, for most bombarding units, never completely destroys them. Air bombardment is the same except the planes fly to the target and may be shot down on the way.
Missile attacks.
Missile attacks are like bombardment, but the unit never returns to its base and the attacks can destroy enemy units.
Air combat.
Air combat occurs between air units.
Repairing Damage.
A unit that takes damage in combat but survives can heal, adding one block per turn back to its health bar. To do so, it
