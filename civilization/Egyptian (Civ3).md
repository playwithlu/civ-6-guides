Description.
The Egyptians are [Religious%20%28Civ3%29](Religious) and [Industrious%20%28Civ3%29](Industrious). They start the game with [Masonry%20%28Civ3%29](Masonry) and [Ceremonial%20Burial%20%28Civ3%29](Ceremonial Burial) and build [War%20Chariot%20%28Civ3%29](War Chariots) instead of normal [Chariot%20%28Civ3%29](Chariots).
Unique Unit: the War Chariot.
When the Hyksos were booted out of Egypt by Ahmose in the years between 1580 and 1522 BC, they left behind a lot of things: pocket change, household items, and a few nifty little toys they called "chariots". Ahmose made the most of this opportunity. While we don't know what he did with the pocket change, we do know that he made the chariot the centerpiece of his new and improved Egyptian army, which dominated the Middle Eastern theatre of war for hundreds of years, until they were supplanted by horse-mounted soldiers, which were cheaper and more durable.
The War Chariot is a more powerful version of the standard Chariot. It has twice the attack strength of a normal Chariot, at no extra cost. Similar to a cheaper early [Horseman%20%28Civ3%29](Horseman), although wheeled so less mobile.
