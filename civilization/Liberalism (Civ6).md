Liberalism is an Economic [Policy%20Cards%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
Liberalism can be a helpful midgame policy to adopt if you have well-developed [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) and are having trouble keeping them happy. The extra will keep your cities growing and productive while you either procure some [Resources%20%28Civ6%29%23Luxury%20Resources](luxury resources) or build some [Entertainment%20Complex%20%28Civ6%29](Entertainment Complexes) and [Arena%20%28Civ6%29](Arenas), at which point you can swap it out for a more helpful policy.
