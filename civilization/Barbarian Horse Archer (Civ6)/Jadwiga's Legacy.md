Strategy.
The Barbarian Horse Archer is a stronger but slower counterpart of the [Scythian%20%28Civ6%29](Scythians') [Saka%20Horse%20Archer%20%28Civ6%29](Saka Horse Archer). It is classified as a ranged cavalry unit, so the attacks of [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Anti-cavalry](anti-cavalry units) such as [Spearman%20%28Civ6%29](Spearmen) and [Pikeman%20%28Civ6%29](Pikemen) will do additional damage to it.
As this unit is very similar to the Saka Horse Archer, all the same tactics can be used to counter it. Outnumber each horse archer to mitigate its mobility and attack it with equal or superior units.
