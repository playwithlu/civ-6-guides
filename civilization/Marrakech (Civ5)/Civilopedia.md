# Marrakech (Civ5)/Civilopedia

Home to one of the largest traditional Arab markets in the world, Marrakech, Morocco, was founded in 1062 AD by King Youssef bin Tashufin to serve as the capital of the Almoravid Dynasty. The city's reputation as a commercial center and trade hub can be attributed to its earliest roots, when caravans stopped in Marrakech to rest and regroup before continuing along the surrounding trade routes. Marrakech's famous market, found in the Jemaa el-Fnaa square in the old city, features elaborate stalls with vendors selling everything from local cuisine to crafts and other items directed at tourists. Performances of varying types are also common in the square, with snake charmers, dancers, and other forms of entertainment continuing into the night. Home to more than one million residents in the present day, Marrakech has seen an influx of expatriates and other Europeans moving to the city for a change of pace.
