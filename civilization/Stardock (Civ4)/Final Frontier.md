Civilopedia entry.
While Capital Shipyards are always highly militarized institutions, Stardocks are much more lax establishments. Open to buyers and sellers from across the universe, Stardocks have become the bazaars of the modern era. Traveling merchants may, for a small fee, dock and open shop within a Stardock, allowing the natives to peruse their offworld wares, purchasing them in exchange for local resources. Although the growing Merchant Guilds seek to monopolize trade among the Star Systems, Stardocks can still greatly increase a system's profits from the routes it possesses.
