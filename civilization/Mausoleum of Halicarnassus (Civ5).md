# Mausoleum of Halicarnassus (Civ5)

Strategy.
One of the earliest wonders, the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus may help an empire considerably in its start, especially if it has the above-mentioned [Resources%20%28Civ5%29](resources) around the [City%20%28Civ5%29](city). The 100 received when a [Great%20People%20%28Civ5%29](Great Person) is expended is throughout the empire, not just in the [Territory%20%28Civ5%29](territory) of the city in which it was built. This extends to [Great%20Prophet%20%28Civ5%29](Great Prophets) expended outside their home territory, even in another [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilization), as well as [Great%20Merchant%20%28Civ5%29](Great Merchants) sent to [City-state%20%28Civ5%29](city-states).
Note that the amount of received from expending Great People is dependent on [Speed%20%28Civ5%29](game speed), so your earnings will be smaller during Quick games and larger during Epic or Marathon games.
On Emperor [Difficulty%20level%20%28Civ5%29](difficulty) and below, [Venetian%20%28Civ5%29](Venice) should prioritize building this wonder, as the Great Merchant point is valuable early on for puppeting city-states. For other civs, the Mausoleum is not as important as others like the [Temple%20of%20Artemis%20%28Civ5%29](Temple of Artemis), [Stonehenge%20%28Civ5%29](Stonehenge), the [Great%20Library%20%28Civ5%29](Great Library), or the [Pyramids%20%28Civ5%29](Pyramids).
