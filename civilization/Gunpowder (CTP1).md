Great Library entry.
The exact discoverer of gunpowder is unknown. Almost certainly its discovery depended on developed agricultural and livestock society since the key ingredient, saltpeter, is an animal byproduct. Gunpowder appeared first in China and then found its way to Europe. Within two Centuries, improved metallurgy and craftsmanship resulted in the muskets and cannons that would quickly dominate the world.
