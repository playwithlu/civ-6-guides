Civilopedia entry.
A barracks is a military school, allowing a city to create better trained soldiers. Most civilizations have had some form of barracks, yet it was the Spartans of Greece that had perhaps the best and most extensive military training system the world has ever seen. In Sparta, all male citizens left home and moved into barracks at the age of seven. They were not allowed to leave the barracks until they had reached the age of thirty.
