Civilopedia entry.
The basis for modern Chemistry was laid by the pseudo-science of alchemy, which attempted to turn base metals into gold and silver through the agency of an elixir or Philosopher's Stone. Alchemy periodically surfaced and degenerated until the real science of Chemistry was found to have economically useful applications. Chemistry was also spurred by the practical needs of Medicine and the theoretical considerations of natural Philosophy.
