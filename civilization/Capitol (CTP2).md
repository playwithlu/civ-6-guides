Great Library entry.
From the beginning of large organized societies, leaders have had a need for a structure in which the government could reside. Early capitol buildings were fortresses, housing the treasury, providing protection and, often, a home for the ruler. The great Assyrian king Sargon II established Dur Sharrukin (Akkadian, meaning "Sargon's Fortress"), a city northeast of Nineveh near the modern Iraqi city of Khorsabad. The city, enclosed by a wall pierced by seven fortified gates, covered one square mile. The towering palace included a temple to Nabu (a god of vegetation and the patron saint of the art of writing), a royal palace, and several residences for important officials. With capitols such as these, rulers could impress both subjects as well as rivals, protecting themselves from riot, invasion, and starvation.
