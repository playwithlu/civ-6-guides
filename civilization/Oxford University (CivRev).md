# Oxford University (CivRev)

Oxford University is a [Wonder%20%28CivRev%29](wonder) in "[Civilization%20Revolution](Civilization Revolution)".
This wonder can be built when the player discovers the [University%20%28technology%29%20%28CivRev%29](University) [List%20of%20technologies%20in%20CivRev](technology) and its benefit is that it gives the player a random single advanced technology they have not discovered. This wonder's benefit is never cancelled as it only works once.
Note that this wonder's benefit is very short-term as it only gives the player one technology they don't have upon completion.
There is a glitch when Oxford University grants you [Advanced%20Flight%20%28CivRev%29](Advanced Flight), even if you don't have [Flight%20%28CivRev%29](Flight) yet. When you end up researching Flight, you can build both [Fighter%20%28CivRev%29](Fighters) and [Bomber%20%28CivRev%29](Bombers).
