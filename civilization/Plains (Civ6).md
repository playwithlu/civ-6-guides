Strategy.
Plains (along with [Grassland%20%28Civ6%29](Grassland)) are one of the most widespread terrains in the world. It is much more balanced than Grassland because its soil, although less fertile, is also rich in minerals and provides a balanced yield of the two most important stats for [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities): and . That makes it the second most suitable terrain to settle, because it ensures that a city may produce things much more quickly right from its onset. Like [Grassland%20%28Civ6%29](Grassland), they are also abundant in terrain features and [Resources%20%28Civ6%29](resources).
Plains trades off Population growth for increased . A city built on Plains will have good , especially if it has any [Hills%20%28Civ6%29](Hills) and [Woods%20%28Civ6%29](Woods) nearby, but growth will be slow until [Farm%20%28Civ6%29](Farms) are established. In this aspect it is good to look for -enhancing features and [Resource%20%28Civ6%29](resources), which will help Population growth early on.
