# Ancient Era (Civ4)

The Ancient Era is the earliest era in "[Civilization%20IV](Civilization IV)" and its expansions. This era represents the beginning of human history. It begins in [4000%20BC](4000 BC). It is succeeded by the [Classical%20Era%20%28Civ4%29](Classical Era).
This is the beginning period for each civilization, when it acquires the basic technologies and tools to control its surroundings. You will establish your capital, explore the lands around you, and begin to build [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ4%29](improvements) on your first patch of land. If you aim at quick expansion, you will probably establish 1 or 2 more [City%20%28Civ4%29](cities) before progressing.
It is unlikely that you will fight anything but [Barbarian%20%28Civ4%29](Barbarians) in this era - there are simply too many of them, and too few of you to attempt to fight another civilization. And you don't want a Barbarian unit wrecking your lands and killing your [Worker%20%28Civ4%29](Workers) while you're off fighting a losing battle against another civilization!
