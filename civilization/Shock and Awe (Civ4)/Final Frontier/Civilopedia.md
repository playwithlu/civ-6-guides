# Shock and Awe (Civ4)/Final Frontier/Civilopedia

One of the few techniques to remain in the military playbook over the last three centuries was that of "Shock and Awe." The fundamentals of Shock and Awe are simple: amass a large enough, fearsome enough force, and let the fear of imminent destruction conquer what guns never could. The failure of past methods to acquire gains in war and deal with domestic disturbances saw new innovations. With smaller, weaker starships unable to accomplish their missions, the universe saw the development of the most powerful starship ever seen - the Battleship. Meanwhile, governments began to turn to a more uncompromising stance on dissidence, becoming essentially a Police State, using Shock and Awe to restrain overly-excitable populaces.
