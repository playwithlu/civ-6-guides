# Tundra (CivBE)

A clear Tundra tile will provide 1 if worked by a citizen.
A city with the [Mass%20Digester%20%28CivBE%29](Mass Digester) building ([Organics%20%28CivBE%29](Organics)) adds 1 to the yield, making tundra effectively the same as [Coast%20%28CivBE%29](Coasts). However, [Farm%20%28CivBE%29](farmland) can only be built on tundra tiles next to a [Rivers%20%28CivBE%29](river) or [Lake%20%28CivBE%29](lake).
