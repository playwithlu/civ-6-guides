# Autocracy (Civ5)/Civilopedia

In an autocracy, one person holds ultimate power. This person is not answerable to anyone - parliament, the nobility, or the people at large. An autocrat may be a dictator who seized power at the head of the military, or he may be a monarch who was born into the position. Or, indeed, the people may have voted him into power. But however he got there, the autocrat is now in charge and cannot be countermanded.
