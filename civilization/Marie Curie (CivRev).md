History.
Polish-born Marie Curie (1867 - 1934 AD) studied physics and mathematics at the Sorbonne in Paris. In 1894 she married Pierre Curie, a professor of physics, and together they pursued studies in physics, especially in the area of radiation. She and her husband received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1903, and following his death in 1906 she continued her research, receiving another Nobel Prize in 1911, this time for Chemistry. She is perhaps the greatest woman scientist in Western history.
