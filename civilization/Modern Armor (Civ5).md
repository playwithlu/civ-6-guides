Strategy.
Modern Armor is the next-generation tank of modern times, capable of dealing with modern [Mechanized%20Infantry%20%28Civ5%29](Mechanized Infantry) and the other highly advanced units of the late game. Its design is vastly improved in almost every way from the older armor unit. Composite elements replace most of the heavier steel ones, making the tank more fuel-efficient; its weapons are also much more efficient. Because of these changes, the Modern Armor doesn't use anymore, but instead.
Strategically, you should use it the same way as earlier .
