# Vulture (Civ4)

The Vulture is the [Unique%20unit%20%28Civ4%29](unique unit) of the [Sumerian%20%28Civ4%29](Sumerian) [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ4](civilization).
Strategy.
Compared to the [Axeman%20%28Civ4%29](Axeman), which this unit replaces, the Vulture has 1 more point of strength, but loses half of its bonus against [Melee%20unit%20%28Civ4%29](Melee units). This means that it actually performs equally well against melee units before [Promotion%20%28Civ4%29](promotions) (since 5 * 1.5 = 6 * 1.25 = 7.5), but it gains more from promotions and does better against non-melee units.
Also, due to the way combat works in "[Civilization%20IV](Civilization IV)", Axemen actually beat Vultures badly.
