# Hungary (Civ5)/Civilopedia

Founded in 895 AD, Hungary is one of the oldest countries in Europe. For centuries the kingdom repelled many attacks against its borders and housed some of the wealthiest kings on the continent - at one point the Hungarian king's income doubled that of England's monarch. In 1217, the crown led the Fifth Crusade into the Holy Land, in the process creating the largest royal army in the history of the Crusades. However, not even this mighty army could stop the sweeping arm of the Mongolian Empire. In 1241, the Mongols invaded Hungary and killed roughly half of the country's population, almost 1 million people. The Hungarian king BÃ©la IV ordered the construction of hundreds of stone fortifications along the borders, stopping some smaller forces, but the greatest damage had already been done.
