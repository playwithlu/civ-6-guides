# Eagle Warrior (Civ6)

The Eagle Warrior is a [Unique%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](unique) [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Melee](melee unit) of the [Aztec%20%28Civ6%29](Aztec) [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It replaces the [Warrior%20%28Civ6%29](Warrior).
Strategy.
The Eagle Warrior is one of the most terrifying units in the early game! Its high strength, combined with the fact it's available from the very start of the game, allows the Aztecs to mount incredibly effective early rushes, comparable only to those of the [Sumerian%20%28Civ6%29](Sumerians). What's more, its unique ability can singlehandedly turn the Aztecs into the fastest developing civilization in the early game! With Builders aplenty, they can quickly upgrade the [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles) around their [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities); what's more, thanks to the Aztecs' [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](civilization ability), they can use Builders to speed up creation.
The only catch is that the Eagle Warrior's ability works only against units of civilizations and [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-states) (as well as [Free%20Cities%20%28Civ6%29](Free Cities) in the expansions), not against [Barbarian%20%28Civ6%29](Barbarians). This practically forces the Aztec player to make war early on if they want to take advantage of these units, but you might want to leave one or two cities alive to succumb to [Loyalty%20%28Civ6%29](Loyalty) pressure to get more use out of your Eagle Warriors even in peacetime. Go get that pesky neighbor!
