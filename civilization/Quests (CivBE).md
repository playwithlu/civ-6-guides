# Quests (CivBE)

A "new" feature in "" is the Quest-system. The 5 main overarching quests of the game are the 5 quests. More quests appear throughout the game as your civilization explores and adapts to their new world.
Note:
Exploration Quests.
Denoted by a yellow looking glass icon.
Culper Lodge Quests.
Denoted by a red triangle with a circle and a dot inside. This long quest chain involves a secret society called and revolves around performing spying operations.
Diplomacy Quests.
Denoted by a purple handshake icon.
Affinity Quests.
Denoted by an icon containing all 3 affinity icons in a circle. Early ones branch, to let you choose an affinity type. At some point the game decides that you are dedicated to a specific affinity, and you will no longer receive branching affinity quests, instead you will only receive affinity specific quests for that one affinity for the rest of the game or "universal" quests rewarded with corresponding affinity points. That is, if the game determines your faction is affinity, you will only get points for quests from now until the rest of that game.
Branching affinity quests.
These quests branch over multiple choices in such a way as to make you choose between the 3 affinity types.
Building Choice Quests.
Every single non wonder [Building%20%28CivBE%29](Building) and some [Tile%20improvement%20%28CivBE%29](Tile Improvements) in CivBE comes with its own choice quest. In those quests you select one of two bonuses for it to give. You cannot end your turn until you have chosen one. These are denoted by a green city icon. Only one of those can trigger every turn, and it triggers automatically a few turns after you build the building/improvement in question. The rewards are usually given per each copy of a building built, and apply locally. A few provide global one time bonuses instead and will be noted as such.
