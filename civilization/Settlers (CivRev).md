# Settlers (CivRev)

Settlers are the backbone of any developing empire. One of them is awarded when [Gold%20%28currency%29%20%28CivRev%29](gold) reserves reach 100. They can found new [City%20%28CivRev%29](cities) and increase the [Population%20%28CivRev%29](population) of a city, which is useful later in the game for siphoning off population from cities that have reached their maximum and helping smaller cities grow.
However, there are some things to note about founding cities:
Settlers cost 2 population, or 1 with [Republic%20%28CivRev%29](Republic). They can also be awarded by [Barbarian%20%28CivRev%29](Barbarian) villages or [Native%20village%20%28CivRev%29](native villages).
