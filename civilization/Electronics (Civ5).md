# Electronics (Civ5)

Game Info.
The discovery of Electronics represents for modern machines what [Electricity%20%28Civ5%29](Electricity) was for Industrial-era machines - a giant leap forward, opening another universe of opportunities. Electronics allows a whole new range of functions in a machine and a whole new level of control, which in turn makes possible increasingly sophisticated machines.
The first results of this are seen in the creation of the biggest contemporary ships - the [Battleship%20%28Civ5%29](Battleship) and the giant [Carrier%20%28Civ5%29](Carrier), whose control systems manage to deal with all complex problems of moving such heavy, bulky objects, filled with so many installations and devices, through the seas.
