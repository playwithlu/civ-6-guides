# Maneuver (Civ6)

Maneuver is a Military [Policy%20Cards%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
This is another of the early Policies which accelerate military [Units%20%28Civ6%29](units') production time. It is usually much more useful than [Maritime%20Industries%20%28Civ6%29](Maritime Industries) (since making cavalry is always useful); however, note that you will only have real use for it if you truly intend (and need) to build cavalry units, and most of these require {{Horses6}}. This makes Maneuver most valuable to [Scythian%20%28Civ6%29](Scythia), who receive two [Horseman%20%28Civ6%29](Horsemen) for each one they train; and to [Indian%20%28Civ6%29](India) and [Alexander%20%28Civ6%29](Alexander), both of whose [Unique%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](unique units) replace the Horseman and have higher {{Production6}} costs. Otherwise, the only units that benefit from Maneuver are the [Heavy%20Chariot%20%28Civ6%29](Heavy Chariot) and [Sumerian%20%28Civ6%29](Sumeria's) [War-Cart%20%28Civ6%29](War-Cart), neither of which have very high {{Production6}} costs. In this case, unless you're planning a cavalry rush, you'll be better off using your Military Policy slot for something else.
The usual advice when it comes to production-oriented Policies is also applicable here: try to plan in advance when you will produce the units, then make a concentrated effort so that you can later remove the Policy and replace it with a more generally useful one, such as [Conscription%20%28Civ6%29](Conscription).
