Gameplay.
The Cargo Helicopter is the primary air transport unit of the game. They are non-offensive units, with limited attack capabilities. They can transport up to five infantry units, such as paratroopers and machine gunners, and can deliver a strike team behind enemy lines. Unlike other air units, they do not have fuel requirements and do not need to land in cities or airbases.
Great Library entry.
Although some military helicopters were primarily designed for ground attack, their capacity to deliver and extract cargo from virtually any location proved most useful. Cargo helicopters came of age in the Vietnam War, and served to airlift infantry units, carry artillery and ammunition and perform rescue operations. Gas-turbine engines vastly improved the operational capacity of the cargo helicopter, enabling it to carry even larger loads.
