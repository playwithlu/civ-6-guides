Everyone imitates the strongest of the day, and this is as true today as it has been 3000 years ago, and will undoubtedly be in another 3000 years. When one nation rises to dominance in its region (be it its continent, planet, or galactic quadrant), other nations will tend to emulate it in every aspect, including its culture. And when this nation undertakes specific steps to incentivize this emulation, for example by actively promoting its culture abroad while subtly suppressing other cultures, then this effect can be weaponized and used to advance much more than just culture.
