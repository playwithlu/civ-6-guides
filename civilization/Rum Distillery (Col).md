# Rum Distillery (Col)

A Rum distillery converts [Sugar%20%28Col%29](Sugar) to [Rum%20%28Col%29](Rum). It is a second tier economic building. Each unskilled worker in the Rum distillery will convert 6 units of Sugar to 6 units of Rum per turn. A [Master%20Distillers%20%28Col%29](Master Distiller) doubles production.
A Rum distillery is an upgrade to the [Rum%20distiller%27s%20house%20%28Col%29](Rum distiller's house), and costs 64 [Hammer%20%28Col%29](Hammers) and 20 [Tools%20%28Col%29](Tools). There is no population requirement to build it. It may be upgraded to a [Rum%20factory%20%28Col%29](Rum factory).
There exists a bug where no limit is placed on the number of workers for this building.
