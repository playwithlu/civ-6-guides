Strategy.
Weak and forgettable, the Great Lighthouse in "Civilization VI" can never match the prowess it used to have in "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)", despite having almost identical bonuses. It provides some minor economic benefits and an extra point, but the bonus for [Naval%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](naval units) is its biggest selling point. Naval units are inherently faster than land units and don't have to worry about [Terrain%20%28Civ6%29](terrain) features impeding their movement, so an extra point of will help them close the gap between two points faster, but won't usually have any major military ramifications.
The one [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) that can greatly benefit from the Great Lighthouse is the [Ottoman%20%28Civ6%29](Ottomans), whose [Barbary%20Corsair%20%28Civ6%29](Barbary Corsair) doesn't use to perform [Combat%20%28Civ6%29%23Coastal%20Raid](Coastal Raids) and can therefore pillage as many [Coastal%20%28Civ6%29](coastal) tiles as it can reach in one turn. [Harald%20Hardrada%20%28Civ6%29](Harald Hardrada's) [Viking%20Longship%20%28Civ6%29](Viking Longship) and [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Naval%20melee](naval melee units) are also good at Coastal Raiding, but since it still costs them 3 to perform this action, 1 extra point of from the Great Lighthouse won't make as much of a difference for them.
Bugs.
The bonus does not affect embarked [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Ranged%20cavalry](ranged cavalry units), [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Support](support units), [Inquisitor%20%28Civ6%29](Inquisitors), or [Warrior%20Monk%20%28Civ6%29](Warrior Monks).
