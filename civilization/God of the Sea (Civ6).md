# God of the Sea (Civ6)

God of the Sea is a [Pantheon%20%28Civ6%29](Pantheon) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It increases the of [Fishing%20Boats%20%28Civ6%29](Fishing Boat) [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](improvements) by 1.
Strategy.
God of the Sea is most useful for [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) such as the [Australian%20%28Civ6%29](Australians), [Dutch%20%28Civ6%29](Dutch), [English%20%28Civ6%29](English), [Indonesian%20%28Civ6%29](Indonesians), [Norwegian%20%28Civ6%29](Norwegians), and [Phoenician%20%28Civ6%29](Phoenicians), who will often have easy access to water-based [Resources%20%28Civ6%29](resources) thanks to unique features that encourage them to found and develop [Coastal%20%28Civ6%29](coastal) [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities). It's also one of the best pantheons for the [M%C4%81ori%20%28Civ6%29](MƒÅori), whose Fishing Boats already provide extra and trigger [Culture%20Bomb%20%28Civ6%29](Culture Bombs).
More indirectly, the [Japanese%20%28Civ6%29](Japanese) can also make good use of this pantheon. [Hojo%20Tokimune%20%28Civ6%29](Hojo Tokimune's) [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader ability) gives [Military%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](military units) defending coastal areas a Combat Strength boost, which should help ensure Japan's water-based resources are less vulnerable to pillaging. (Not to mention that enemy [Naval%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](naval) and embarked units will have to worry about little things like [Storm%20%28Civ6%29%23Hurricane](Hurricanes)!)
This Pantheon's main downside is that it may take more time (or ) to get all the marine resources available to a city properly online than it usually does to get multiple land-based resources properly set up. On the other end, once you reach the [Future%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Future Era), well-placed [Seastead%20%28Civ6%29](Seasteads) will complement it quite nicely, as they essentially generate 2 additional for each adjacent Fishing Boat.
