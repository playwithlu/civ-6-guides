# Khan (Civ5)

Game Info.
A [Great%20People%20%28Civ5%29](Great Person), unique to the [Mongolian%20%28Civ5%29](Mongolian) [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilization). Replaces the [Great%20General%20%28Civ5%29](Great General).
The unit is expended after performing either of these actions.
Strategy.
The Mongolian Khan is a significant improvement over the standard [Great%20General%20%28Civ5%29](Great General). Besides normal combat bonuses and the ability to construct a [Citadel%20%28Civ5%29](Citadel), the Khan is able to move at the same rate as the [Keshik%20%28Civ5%29](Keshik) (5 points per turn), which confers him enormous mobility throughout the game. But more importantly, the Khan enables adjacent units (but not units on the same tile!) to heal for an additional 2 HP per turn (15 in ' and '). This beefed-up Great General ensures that his cavalry units will always be in a battle ready state.
