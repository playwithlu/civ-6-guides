# Byblos (Civ5)/Wonders of the Ancient World/Civilopedia

One of the oldest cities in the world, the Phoenician settlement of Byblos, located in modern Lebanon, was founded sometime in the 5th millennium BC. Originally known as Gebal, the name "Byblos" (from the Greek "Bublos," for Papyrus) was given by the Greeks because the city served as the primary importer of Egyptian papyrus.
