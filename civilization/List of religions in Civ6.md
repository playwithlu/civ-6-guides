There are twelve default [Religion%20%28Civ6%29](religions) in the game, and some leaders have a preferred religion that the [AI](AI) will choose if possible:
Custom Religions.
In addition to the above, there are also default icons for "custom religions" for which a player will be asked to type in a name. AI leaders will never found a custom religion; if they have no preferred religion or theirs is already taken, they will randomly choose from one of the default religions.
