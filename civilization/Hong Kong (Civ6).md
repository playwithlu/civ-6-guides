# Hong Kong (Civ6)

Hong Kong is an industrial [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-state) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
Hong Kong's bonuses focus solely on . Its [Suzerain%20%28Civ6%29](Suzerain) bonus allows players to finish city [Project%20%28Civ6%29](projects), such as [Commercial%20Hub%20Investment%20%28Civ6%29](Commercial Hub Investments) or [Holy%20Site%20Prayers%20%28Civ6%29](Holy Site Prayers), at a 20% discount. There are only a few occasions in which you may want to run multiple city projects back to back, namely running Holy Site Prayers to secure an early religion, early [Encampment%20Training%20%28Civ6%29](Encampment Training) for an early [Great%20General%20%28Civ6%29](Great General) for early war, [Theater%20Square%20Performances%20%28Civ6%29](Theater Square Performances) in the mid game to secure as many as possible, [Campus%20Research%20Grants%20%28Civ6%29](Campus Research Grants) and Space Race projects at the end of a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Science](Science Victory) (which is probably the most important and useful usage of Hong Kong), or [Send%20Aid%20%28Civ6%29](Send Aid), which grows in value based on the number of players in the game, thus making Hong Kong change widely from fairly low-priority to fairly high-priority city-state at various points in the game depending on the kind of game you are playing.
[Catherine%20de%20Medici%20%28Civ6%29/Magnificence](Magnificence Catherine de Medici) of [French%20%28Civ6%29](France) excels with Hong Kong, as a late-game cultural push with them will often consist of spamming [Court%20Festival%20%28Civ6%29](Court Festival) projects in all of France's cities. [Brazilian%20%28Civ6%29](Brazil) is probably the [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) most inclined to take advantage of Hong Kong's bonuses for the same reason as Magnificence Catherine, as a late-game cultural push with them will often consist of spamming [Carnival%20%28Civ6%29](Carnival) projects in all of Brazil's cities, but Carnival is much more likely to be used earlier in the game. [Phoenician%20%28Civ6%29](Phoenicia) can also take Suzerainty of Hong Kong to more quickly finish their [Move%20Capital%20%28Civ6%29](Move Capital) project. Conversely, Hong Kong is completely worthless to [Chinese%20%28Civ6%29](China) when led by [Yongle%20%28Civ6%29](Yongle), as his Lijia projects convert city directly into , , and and don't benefit from percentage bonuses.
