# Planet Carver (CivBE)

Game info.
Note: Before the the Planet Carver was unlocked with the technology.
Strategy.
This satellite is the [http%3A//cnc.wikia.com/wiki/Ion_cannon](Ion cannon) of [Civilization%20Beyond%20Earth](Civilization Beyond Earth). It can launch a devastating energy beam capable of vaporizing anything on the ground with impunity. Although its range is slightly smaller than the Laser Satellite, the huge power of the Planet Carver more than compensates for it. This unit is capable of one-shooting most middle-game-level units, and is also highly effective against late game and Ultimate units. Use it whenever you can in serious battles!
In Universe information.
The Planet Carvers were originally designed as non-military tools, intended to help with heavy duty mining operations. Using many of the same technologies as the Orbital Laser, the Carvers add into the mixture a fusion reactor which triggers a short-lived nuclear blast, whose energy is then focused down to the surface. The result, however, was deemed too destructive for civilian purposes, as many times the residual heat of the blast damaged beyond repair any machinery within a 50-mile radius around the target. Of course, this was good news for military commanders who requisitioned the technology and soon turned it into their most destructive weapon.
It bears to mention that the real output of the Planet Carver's beam has never been accurately measured as all tech capable of doing that has been vaporized during the experiments.
