# Petra (Civ6)

Petra is a in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It must be built on [Desert%20%28Civ6%29](Desert) or [Desert%20Floodplains%20%28Civ6%29](Desert Floodplains).
Strategy.
Petra can turn a desert [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) into a bustling metropolis with high growth and potential. However, the city can quickly run into issues, since it receives a huge amount of but very few [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](improvements) can be built in deserts to provide extra . For this reason, Petra is best built in a city with a lot of [Desert%20%28Hills%29%20%28Civ6%29](Desert Hills), which can be further improved with [Mine%20%28Civ6%29](Mines). Running domestic s from the city or using [Isidore%20of%20Miletus%20%28Civ6%29](Isidore of Miletus) or [Filippo%20Brunelleschi%20%28Civ6%29](Filippo Brunelleschi) (or a few [Builder%20%28Civ6%29](Builders') build charges, when playing as [Qin%20Shi%20Huang%20%28Civ6%29](Qin Shi Huang)) can provide the needed to complete Petra quickly.
[Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](Civilizations) like [Australian%20%28Civ6%29](Australia), [Nubian%20%28Civ6%29](Nubia), [Chinese%20%28Civ6%29](China), [Indian%20%28Civ6%29](India), [Spanish%20%28Civ6%29](Spain) and [Malian%20%28Civ6%29](Mali), which can improve flat Desert tiles or have bonuses independent from standard improvements, are able to gain extra utility from Petra. They should always focus on having a productive desert city if they manage to build it.
"" makes deserts much more desirable thanks to [Storm%20%28Civ6%29](dust storms), which can significantly improve the base yields of Desert tiles. Of course, this won't change the situation with improvements, but it adds one more source of growth and that desert cities always need. Additionally, the [Nazca%20Line%20%28Civ6%29](Nazca Line), which is available if you're the [Suzerain%20%28Civ6%29](Suzerain) of [Nazca%20%28Civ6%29](Nazca), can help you further improve Desert tiles in Petra's city. Bear in mind, however, that tiles with Nazca Lines cannot be worked, so the best place to build these improvements is 4 [hex](hex)es away from the [City%20Center%20%28Civ6%29](City Center) - this way, they can enhance the yields of tiles on the periphery of the city's workable area, and the yields provided by Petra are always better than those provided by a Nazca Line anyway.
