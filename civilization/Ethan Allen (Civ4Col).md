# Ethan Allen (Civ4Col)

Civilopedia.
Lived: 1738-1789
Fort Ticonderoga was key to American victory in the Revolution, not simply for its strategic location on Lake Champlain, but also for its stock of cannon and artillery, essential for the continued campaign against the well-armed British forces. Ethan Allen and his compatriots, the Green Mountains Boys, decided the fort needed to be taken. In 1775, sneaking to the fortress under cover of darkness, Allen's men took Ticonderoga with little struggle, ensuring that the strategic location and the artillery both found their way into American hands. Allen would go on to become a key figure in early Vermont politics, acting as the colony's delegate to the Constitutional Congress.
