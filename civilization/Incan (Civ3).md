In "Civilization III: Conquests", the Incans are considered to be an expansionist and agricultural civilization. They start the game with Pottery and Masonry. They also begin the game with a regular Scout and may build their unique Chasqui Scout units thereafter.
Unique Unit: the Chasqui Scout.
The Chasqui scout system was the Incan equivalent to the Pony Express. Fast, agile, and capable of running long distances, Chasqui scouts carried memorized messages along the Imperial road systems of the Andes Mountains. Couriers donned with distinctly white feathered headdresses, Chasquis would memorize information, carry it to other scouts waiting along the relay system, and then run along with them until they memorized the message, and so on until the message was delivered. In this way, a message could travel over hundreds of miles within a few short days. Chasqui scouts were also used by the Incan army on campaign, to retrieve and deliver messages between the moving columns.
The Incan Chasqui Scout is a scout unit that replaces the basic scout for the Inca. He has a modest attack and defensive capability. He is also very fast and ignores movement costs for both hills and mountains.
