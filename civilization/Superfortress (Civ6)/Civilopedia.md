Carpet bombing – also known as area bombing, saturation bombing, and the descriptive obliteration bombing – is a wave of bombers dropping large amounts of untargeted explosives to inflict maximum damage on every part of a selected area of land. This indiscriminate bombing of an entire area is quite effective, if expensive in terms of munitions, in leveling fields and farms, industrial areas, neighborhoods, and everything else. The first instance of carpet bombing was that by the Condor Legion during the Spanish Civil War against enemy forces scattered on the rocky slopes during the battle of El Mazuco. Throughout World War II, all the major combatants resorted to carpet bombing techniques. Eventually, of course, such bombing against areas containing a "concentration of civilians" was outlawed by the 1977 Protocol I of the Geneva Convention.
