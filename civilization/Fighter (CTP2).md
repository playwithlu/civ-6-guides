Great Library entry.
The fighter airplane, which was primarily designed to destroy other aircraft in combat, was introduced in the first World War, but did not played a key role until World War II. They were often the highest performing aircraft of their times, capable of outflying and outmaneuvering opposing fighters. They were armed with weapons specially designed to hit enemy aircraft, such as rapid-fire machine guns.
During World War II, all-metal, propeller-engine fighters were capable of speeds of 450 miles and reached ceilings of 35,000 to 40,000 feet. Some of the more notable fighters from that period were the British Spitfire and Hurricane, the U.S. P-38 Lightning and P-51 Mustang, the German Focke Wulf FW-190 and the Japanese Zero. Uses of fighters included air support for naval sorties, reconnaissance, light bombing runs, dogfighting, harassment and support for ground attacks.
