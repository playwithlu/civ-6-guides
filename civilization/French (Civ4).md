# French (Civ4)

The French people represent a [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ4](civilization) in "[Civilization%20IV](Civilization IV)".
Strategy.
France is well-suited to a [Victory%20%28Civ4%29%23Cultural](cultural victory), but all [Victory%20%28Civ4%29](victory) types are achievable based on gameplay. [Louis%20XIV%20%28Civ4%29](Louis XIV) and [De%20Gaulle%20%28Civ4%29](De Gaulle) are especially well-suited to a cultural victory due to the "[Industrious%20%28Civ4%29](Industrious)" [Leader%20trait%20%28Civ4%29](trait), which boosts [List%20of%20wonders%20in%20Civ4](Wonder) production. Louis XIV is the king, though, due to his second trait being "[Creative%20%28Civ4%29](Creative)."
While the [Musketeer%20%28Civ4%29](Musketeer) is one of the weaker unique units in the game (and somewhat of a disappointment considering how [Napoleon%20%28Civ4%29](Napoleon) dominated [Europe](Europe) with his armies), the [Salon%20%28Civ4%29](Salon) is France's hidden gem. The Salon is a great way to boost science while gaining culture. Build it as soon as possible in every [City%20%28Civ4%29](city) for the free [Artist%20%28Civ4%29](Artist).
Settle a few cities in sublime locations and build powerful armies to protect your empire on the way to an easy and pleasant win under the French.
