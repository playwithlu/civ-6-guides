As with other maps by that designer, the human start position has a few advantages, including irregular extra bonus tiles (mostly fish, iron, and diamonds) and a considerable area for expansion with minimal chance of early invasion. Roads indicate good sites for new cities but may not suit every player's style. An experienced player should have no trouble at "Hard" level.
Make friends with everyone if possible, and try to expand westward so as to restrict those friends' expansion!
