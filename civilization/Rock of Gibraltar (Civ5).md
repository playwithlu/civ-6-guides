The Rock of Gibraltar provides and bonuses to the [City%20%28Civ5%29](city) that works it. However, it is sometimes located far away from land, which can make it impossible to found a city close enough to work the wonder. Like a [Mountain%20%28Civ5%29](mountain), the tile it occupies can only be entered by a [Helicopter%20Gunship%20%28Civ5%29](Helicopter Gunship), which does not sustain damage if left there.
