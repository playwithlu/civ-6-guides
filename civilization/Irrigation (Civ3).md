# Irrigation (Civ3)

Irrigation increases food production. Only squares adjacent to fresh water (river or lake) or to another irrigated square may be irrigated. After the discovery of [Electricity%20%28Civ3%29](Electricity), you can irrigate a tile without proximity to fresh water.
Since "[Civilization%20III%20Play%20the%20World](Play the World)" it is possible to irrigate through the [City%20%28Civ3%29](city) square. In other words, if a city square has an adjacent irrigated tile, any other tile adjacent to that city square can be irrigated too. And unlike normal irrigation, cities can be built on hills.
[Worker%20%28Civ3%29](Workers) are ordered to irrigate by pressing [I] or the "Irrigate" button.
