# Architecture (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Some of the greatest architects of the world lived during ancient times: the
pyramid builders of Egypt, the parthenon builders of Greece, the colosseum builders
of Rome. All of them shared a genius for geometry and physics, of form and function,
and they created structures that have withstood the ravages of time.
