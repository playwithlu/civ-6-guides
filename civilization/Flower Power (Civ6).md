Flower Power is a [Dark%20Age%20%28Civ6%29](Dark Age) [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "". It is available from the [Atomic%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Atomic Era) to the [Future%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Future Era) and uses a {{WildcardSlotIcon6}} Wildcard slot.
Strategy.
If you've saved up a lot of {{Faith6}} and are closing in on a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Cultural Victory) at the beginning of a {{DarkAge6}}, Flower Power will help your [Rock%20Band%20%28Civ6%29](Rock Bands) propel you to the finish line. However, it will increase the cost of producing or purchasing [Military%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](military units), so make sure your defenses are in order when you adopt it.
