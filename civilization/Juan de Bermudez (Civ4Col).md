# Juan de Bermudez (Civ4Col)

Civilopedia.
Lived: ??? -1570
Juan de Bermudez was a Spanish captain, explorer, and discoverer of Bermuda. As a crewman on the Pinta, Bermudez saw first hand the island to be named San Salvador, later Hispanola and met Arawaks and Tainos. So beguiled was Bermudez with this new land that he returned on Columbus' third voyage and remained in Columbus' colony of Hispaniola to aid in calming the uprisings created by his captain's poor managerial skills. Wanderlust again striking the explorer, Bermudez joined Ponce de Leon on his famous journey to the North American mainland. Yet what Bermudez will be most remembered for will be lending his name to a small group of islands off the coast of North America - Bermuda.
