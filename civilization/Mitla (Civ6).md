# Mitla (Civ6)

Mitla is a scientific [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-state) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It replaced [Palenque%20%28Civ6%29](Palenque) under all rulesets in the [Maya%20%26amp%3B%20Gran%20Colombia%20Pack%20%28Civ6%29](Maya &amp; Gran Colombia Pack).
Strategy.
The faster growth rate provided by Mitla works similar to other growth rate bonuses in the game, like the [Hanging%20Gardens%20%28Civ6%29](Hanging Gardens) or the [Fertility%20Rites%20%28Civ6%29](Fertility Rites) [Pantheon%20%28Civ6%29](pantheon), as it modifies the amount of {{Food6}} after accounting for citizen consumption, not the total amount of {{Food6}}, so this is always negligible. Coupled with the fact that this bonus comes with a condition that the city needs a Campus and the existence of {{Housing6}} in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)", Mitla should be close to the bottom of your city-state priority list.
