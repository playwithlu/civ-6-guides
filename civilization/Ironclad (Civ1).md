# Ironclad (Civ1)

The Ironclad cannot carry other units.
Civilopedia entry.
During the American Civil War, Ironclad ships first demonstrated their superiority over the wooden warships that dominated world navies. Ironclads were nearly impervious to the naval weaponry of the era, while wooden ships were easily penetrated and wrecked by the large-caliber explosive shells. Ironclads were the first of future generations of armored ships that ruled the waves for most of the next one hundred years.
