# Civilizations (Civ6)

Civilizations are playable factions, each of which represents a historical nation, empire or cultural group. Each civilization in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)" has a [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](unique ability) and two other unique components: a [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](unit) and a piece of infrastructure, which may be a [Building%20%28Civ6%29](building), a [District%20%28Civ6%29](district), or a [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](tile improvement).
"Civilization VI" makes a distinction between a civilization and its [Leaders%20%28Civ6%29](leader), not unlike "[Civilization%20IV](Civilization IV)" - each civilization can now have multiple leaders, and each leader comes with their own unique ability, which is added to the other unique traits of the civilization (and, in some cases, provides an additional [Unique%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](unique unit), piece of infrastructure, and/or [Governor%20%28Civ6%29](Governor) that further augments that civ's and leader's specifics). When they are controlled by [AI](AI), each leader also pursues a specific [Agenda%20%28Civ6%29](agenda) throughout the game, which modifies the AI behavior of this civilization. Thus the same civilization may behave quite differently throughout the game, depending on which leader is currently at its head. A wise player will learn not only all different civilizations' special abilities and units, but also their leaders' special traits and agendas, which will allow them to anticipate the AI behavior during the game.
[Vanilla](Vanilla) "Civilization VI" included 18 different civilizations at the launch, with the [Aztec%20%28Civ6%29](Aztecs) (19th) as a pre-order bonus that became available to everyone 90 days after the launch. The [Polish%20%28Civ6%29](Poles), [Australian%20%28Civ6%29](Australians), [Persian%20%28Civ6%29](Persians), [Macedonian%20%28Civ6%29](Macedonians), [Nubian%20%28Civ6%29](Nubians), [Khmer%20%28Civ6%29](Khmer), and [Indonesian%20%28Civ6%29](Indonesians) were later added as [DLC%20%28Civ6%29](DLC). The ' and ' expansions and the "" DLC pack added 8 new civilizations each, bringing the total number of civilizations to 50, the largest number of playable civilizations in any game in the "[Civilization%20%28series%29](Civilization)" franchise to date.
Originally there was only one civilization with multiple leaders: the [Greek%20%28Civ6%29](Greeks), who may be led by either [Pericles%20%28Civ6%29](Pericles) or [Gorgo%20%28Civ6%29](Gorgo). The "Rise and Fall" expansion added [Chandragupta%20%28Civ6%29](Chandragupta) as an alternative leader to [Gandhi%20%28Civ6%29](Gandhi) for the [Indian%20%28Civ6%29](Indians). The "Gathering Storm" expansion added [Eleanor%20of%20Aquitaine%20%28Civ6%29](Eleanor of Aquitaine), who can lead either the [English%20%28Civ6%29](English) or the [French%20%28Civ6%29](French), and the [Vietnam%20%26amp%3B%20Kublai%20Khan%20Pack%20%28Civ6%29](Vietnam &amp; Kublai Khan Pack) added [Kublai%20Khan%20%28Civ6%29](Kublai Khan), who can lead either the [Chinese%20%28Civ6%29](Chinese) or the [Mongolian%20%28Civ6%29](Mongolians). With the free offer of [Julius%20Caesar%20%28Civ6%29](Julius Caesar) and the "" DLC pack, 13 more leaders for existing civilizations would be added to the game.
