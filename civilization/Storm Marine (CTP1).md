Great Library entry.
In a military arena dominated by robotic automatons, strategists searched for new ways to defeat the new artificially intelligent breed. The answer was a return to good old human ingenuity. The Space Marines returned human judgment and reflexes to space warfare, creating an agile warrior who could combine skillful capriciousness and daunting strength. The return to an exoskeleton, even one was a momentous move for the humans. With the protection of an exoskeleton (made from a material as durable as Chitin 3000) and a plasma-pulse rifle, Space Marines came to be the choice defenders of the Space City.
