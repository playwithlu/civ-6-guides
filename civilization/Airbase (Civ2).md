# Airbase (Civ2)

Airbases are tile {{Link2|improvement}}s in "[Civilization%20II](Civilization II)".
Civilopedia entry.
After the discovery of [Radio%20%28Civ2%29](Radio), your [Settlers%20%28Civ2%29](Settlers) and [Engineers%20%28Civ2%29](Engineers) have the ability to construct Airbases. Airbases act as remote refueling stations for Fighters, Bombers, Stealth Fighters, and Stealth Bombers. Strategically placed Airbases effectively extend the range of these units, allowing them to operate farther from friendly cities and [Carrier%20%28Civ2%29](Carriers).
To build an Airbase, chose the "Airbase" command from the Orders menu, or press the "e" key.
