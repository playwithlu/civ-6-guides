# Militia (Civ1)

The Militia is the first military unit available in the game.
Civilopedia entry.
The first military units were simply the citizenry armed with whatever tools and weapons they could grab. Although Militia units were inexpensive to organize and maintain, they were not effective against trained armies. However, Militia units continued in use for many years due to the speed in which they could be raised. They were useful for stopgaps while superior units could be trained or brought forward, and were certainly better than no defense at all.
