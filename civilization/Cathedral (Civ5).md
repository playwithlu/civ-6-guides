Strategy.
Cathedrals boost more than the other religious buildings. Indeed, in ", the Cathedral comes with +3 bonus and an added Specialist slot.
In ", the Cathedral has been overhauled so that it only generates +1 , and no longer has the Specialist slot. Still, the Cathedral is the best religious building for boosting because each Cathedral now has one slot for a [Great%20Work%20%28Civ5%29](Great Work of Art), which makes up for the changes made to the building.
Note that you can only purchase a Cathedral in one of your own cities in which your religion is the majority (i.e., it has your religious symbol to the right of its name).
