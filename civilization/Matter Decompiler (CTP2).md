Gameplay.
A Matter Decompiler breaks down waste into molecular building blocks. Instead of throwing away unwanted items as trash, citizens may process them with a Matter Decompiler and create other things. The ability to completely recycle virtually any waste product into something useful dramatically reduces pollution from production.
Great Library entry.
One of the most amazing applications of nano-machines, the matter decompiler was one of the most advanced waste disposal system in history. Capable of breaking down any matter, such as garbage and organic waste, into primary elements, the matter decompiler enabled cities to recycle all waste products with unparalleled efficiency. The product was reusable elements that could be reintegrated into manufactured items. This dramatically reduced the pollution associated with solid waste disposal.
