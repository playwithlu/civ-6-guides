# Infantry (Civ5)

Game Info.
Powerful front-line unit of the [Modern%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Modern Era) ([Industrial%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Industrial Era) in [vanilla](vanilla)). Upgrades from the [Great%20War%20Infantry%20%28Civ5%29](Great War Infantry) ([Rifleman%20%28Civ5%29](Rifleman) in vanilla).
Strategy.
The Infantry is armed withÂ [World%20War%20II](World War II) era semiautomatic rifles, grenades, and the cunning and mobility necessary to survive an increasingly mechanized battlefield. It's stronger than its predecessor, the Great War Infantry (or Rifleman). Modern combat is increasingly complex, and on its own an Infantry unit is vulnerable to air, artillery, and tank attacks (although its decent strength allows it to withstand a fair amount of abuse). When possible, Infantry should be supported by artillery, tanks, and air (or anti-air) units.
