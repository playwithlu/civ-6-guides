Intro.
Greetings noble Hiawatha, leader of the mighty Iroquois nations!Â Long have your people lived near the great and holy lake Ontario in the land that has come to be known as New York state in North America. In the mists of antiquity, the five peoples, Seneca, Onondaga, Mohawks, Cayugas, and Oneida united into one nation, the Haudenosaunee, the Iroquois. With no written language, the wise men of your nation created the great law of peace, the model for many constitutions including that of the United States. For many years, your people battled great enemies the Huron and the French and the English invaders. Though outnumbered and facing weapons far more advanced than the ones your warriors wielded, the Iroquois survived and prospered until they were finally overwhelmed by the mighty armies of the new United States.
Oh noble Hiawatha, listen to the cries of your people! They call out to you to lead them in peace and war, to rebuild the great longhouse and unite the tribes once again. Will you accept this challenge, great leader? Will you build a civilization that will stand the test of time?
