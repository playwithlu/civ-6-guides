# Sea base (SMAC)

A sea base is any base built on water. They are a good way to boost your population (for council votes and production of colony pods) and energy.
Disadvantages.
Mining problems.
Other than the spots where mineral bonuses are found, there is a severe shortage of minerals.
Mining platforms only give +1 minerals until the discovery of discovery of [Advanced%20Ecological%20Engineering%20%28SMAC%29](Advanced Ecological Engineering) gives you +1 minerals. You get an additional +1 minerals in bases you build the [Sub%20Sea%20Trunkline%20%28SMAC%29](Sub Sea Trunkline) facility. Compared to what you get from mining on land, its not much at all.
There are however other ways to get minerals to sea bases.
Creation.
A sea base is created by a sea colony pod, or if a land base is submerged in water (due to rising sea level) while protected by a pressure dome (otherwise it is destroyed). A sea base can also become a land base if sea levels drop.
Defense.
Sea bases are best defended by land units (usually infantry) than naval units, as they will also count as police. A sea base can be attacked and captured directly by a naval unit, or by a unit with amphibious assault. The AI never produces naval probe-teams, so there is no need to build defensive teams.
Energy.
If you have [Adaptive%20Economics%20%28SMAC%29](Adaptive Economics) you can start to produce a Thermocline Transducer in all of your bases, for +1 energy for all tiles. This doesn't work unless you have [Environmental%20Economics%20%28SMAC%29](Environmental Economics) also.
Sea bases would benefit greatly from this as they can have kelp and tidal harnesses built on each water square, and there is plenty of open water to get to and build new bases at.
Once your population has grown higher than necessary to work every spot the base has within reach, you can shift excess people to research scientists. You can build facilities there to boost the points going to your tech research.
Military.
Once you have , you may build the [Secret_Projects_%28SMAC%29](Secret Project) [List_of_Secret_Projects_%28SMAC%29%23Maritime_Control_Center](Maritime Control Center), provided no one else has completed it before you. It provides a free Naval Yard in every one of your bases, and +2 movement points for all your naval units.
The [Nautilus%20Pirates](Nautilus Pirates) automatically receive a free Naval Yard once they complete Doctrine: Initiative.
