# Xeno Cavalry (CivBE)

Game info.
The Xeno Cavalry is built from human soldiers mounted on domesticated alien lifeforms. It is an agile melee cavalry unit. This unit has the potential to be one of the best Harmony units as it has a low and Production cost, as well as having relatively high Strength and Movement statistics, allowing it to be an aggressive attacker. 
Unit Upgrades.
Tier 1.
Tier 1 Xeno Cavalry arrive slightly earlier than Tier 3 Combat Rovers, their basic alternative, and have higher Strength, less Production cost but cost 2 . Depending on your city placement, getting enough Xenomass for a group of Xeno Cavalry is very useful in the mid game as it allows you to raid effectively as well as clean out alien nests. Xeno Cavalry, with Tier 3 Combat Rovers are the dawn of mobility in the strategic battlefield as they begin to be a powerful, subversive force.
Tier 2.
Tier 2 Xeno Cavalry are far stronger than their Tier 4 Combat Rover alternatives, and also more powerful than Battlesuits. However, they are weaker than CARVRs albeit more mobile. Their main strength is that they are very mobile and that they also cost 380 , which is cheaper than a basic Tier 4 Combat Rover and all of the other cavalry alternatives. It can receive immense bonuses from Miasma, as well as generic affinity-specific bonuses such as a lone bonus or flanking bonus. Xeno Cavalry are great as frontline cavalry units, alternative to Combat Rovers or CARVRs.
