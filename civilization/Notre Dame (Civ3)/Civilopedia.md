# Notre Dame (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris is one of the early examples of Gothic architecture. A mammoth project, Notre Dame took almost 
a century to complete; the only reason it succeeded in the end was the consistent support of French monarchs. It was nearly destroyed 
on several occasions, most notably the French Revolution when the revolutionaries narrowly decided to rededicate the cathedral (to "reason") rather 
than destroy it. Notre Dame still stands today, and is still used as the center of Catholic administration in Paris, not to mention being a major 
tourist attraction.
