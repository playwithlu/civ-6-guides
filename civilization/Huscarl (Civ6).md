# Huscarl (Civ6)

The Huscarl is a [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Melee](melee unit) from the [Vikings%2C%20Traders%2C%20and%20Raiders%21%20%28Civ6%29](Vikings, Traders, and Raiders!) [List%20of%20scenarios%20in%20Civ6](scenario) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
Huscarls are quick to produce, and their enhanced defense against ranged attacks represents the shield walls they form in battle. Use them to lead the charge against enemy [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities), drawing their fire while your other [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](units) focus on weakening their defenses. In other words, they can be used as defensively orientated siege units. Try to ensure they have at least the [Tortoise%20%28Civ6%29](Tortoise) [List%20of%20promotions%20in%20Civ6%23Melee%20Units](promotion) when using them as such in order to boost their innate advantage further ([Battlecry%20%28Civ6%29](Battlecry) is another useful promotion with regards as to enemy defenders). If you have to use them offensively against a city, have a [Battering%20Ram%20%28Civ6%29](Battering Ram) close by.
