April the 12th, 1861, Confederate mortars open fire on Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor, signalling the start of America's Civil War.

Special Rules.
City Razing and [Settler%20%28Civ5%29](Settlers) are off. [City%20%28Civ5%29](Cities) must have at least one of four specialized [Building%20%28Civ5%29](buildings) to create military [Unit%20%28Civ5%29](units): an Arsenal (Infantry), a Stable (Cavalry), an Iron Works (Artillery), or a Navy Yard (Naval Units).
