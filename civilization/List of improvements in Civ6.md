# List of improvements in Civ6

The following is a list of tile improvements in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)" and its expansions.
This list excludes different types of [Roads%20%28Civ6%29](Roads), since you can still further improve [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles) containing Roads with another improvement.
Standard.
These improvements are available to all [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) after researching their respective [Technology%20%28Civ6%29](technologies) or [Civic%20%28Civ6%29](civics).
City-state.
These improvements can be built by any civilization that is the [Suzerain%20%28Civ6%29](Suzerain) of the specified [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-state). Thus, whether you can construct these improvements with your [Builder%20%28Civ6%29](Builders) will depend on whether that particular city-state is present in your game and whether you are their Suzerain. Once built, these improvements stay there permanently, even if the territory they are built in changes hands, or the relevant city-state gets conquered. However, when pillaged, these improvements cannot be repaired if the city-state is no longer independent (i.e., its city-state status is lost to a civilization through military conquest or [Loyalty%20%28Civ6%29](Loyalty) flipping).
Unique.
These tile improvements are tied to a specific civilization or [Leaders%20%28Civ6%29](leader) and, as such, will only be available to a player who is using that civilization or leader. When areas on the [Map%20%28Civ6%29](map) that contain unique improvements change hands (i.e., their controlling [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) gets conquered by another civilization), these improvements simply vanish, and their tile becomes "virgin" land.
The only exception to this rule is the [Feitoria%20%28Civ6%29](Feitoria). Feitorias can only be built by [Portuguese%20%28Civ6%29](Portuguese) [Nau%20%28Civ6%29](Naus) in foreign land and will stay there even if the parent city gets conquered by a third-party civilization. However, if the parent city is conquered by Portugal, all Feitorias inside will be removed.
Governor.
Governor improvements are a new type of tile improvement introduced in "". They can be built in any city to which a [Liang%20%28Surveyor%29%20%28Civ6%29](Surveyor Governor) with the requisite title has been assigned.
National Park.
National Parks are not tile improvements per se. They can only be created by [Naturalist%20%28Civ6%29](Naturalists) or [Mountie%20%28Civ6%29](Mounties) by designating the tiles which are to form part of the National Park. A Naturalist will be consumed after expending its charge to establish a National Park.
Game mode-specific improvements.
Zombie Defense.
None of the improvements exclusive to this mode can be pillaged or have their tiles worked.
