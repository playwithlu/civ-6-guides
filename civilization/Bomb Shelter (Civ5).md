# Bomb Shelter (Civ5)

Game Info.
Special defense building.
Strategy.
The Bomb Shelter is the only defense developed against the horrific effects of [Nuclear%20weapons%20%28Civ5%29](nukes). In case of a nuclear strike, the Bomb Shelter will save most citizens in the [City%20%28Civ5%29](city), although it won't defend any [Unit%20%28Civ5%29](units) outside of it.
In "", all military units in a city with a Bomb Shelter sustain only 25% damage from nukes (-25 [HP](HP) max), but civilian units caught in the blast radius die regardless.
