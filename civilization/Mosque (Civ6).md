# Mosque (Civ6)

The Mosque is an advanced [Religion%20%28Civ6%29](religious) [Building%20%28Civ6%29](building) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is built in the {{Link6|Holy Site}} {{Link6|district}} and requires a {{Link6|Temple}} (or one of its replacements). It may also be purchased with {{Faith6}}.
Strategy.
The Mosque can help speed up the spread of your religion, making it very useful when pursuing a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Religion](Religious Victory). The main advantage of it is that you only really need one. That makes it a much cheaper investment than all the other religious buildings (which are frankly expensive for what you get), though later in the game you may want to dot a few more around the globe.
This building has extra synergy with the [Hagia%20Sophia%20%28Civ6%29](Hagia Sophia) and the [Orator%20%28Civ6%29](Orator) or [Pilgrim%20%28Civ6%29](Pilgrim) {{Promotion6}}, as it can give Apostles an unprecedented 7 or 8 Spread Religion charges.
