# Gameplay (C-evo)

"[C-evo](C-evo)" is an [empire](empire)-building game, dealing with the history of humans from the earliest permanent settlement to the Space Race. The game starts with the development of the [wheel%20%28C-evo%29](wheel), and ends when the first player has successfully constructed the first off-planet [spaceship%20%28C-evo%29](spaceship) headed out into the Solar System. 
Components.
The game includes aspects of:
Decision-making.
Players must constantly make decisions such as:
A successful player manages to find a balance among these choices. 
As the game progresses, the player finds that the building of [factory%20%28C-evo%29](factories), for example, leads to increased pollution, which reduces production and therefore should be cleaned up and could be reduced or eliminated through development of cleaner [advance%20%28C-evo%29](technologies). 
At all stages, cities that grow larger than size 4 have reduced productivity because of unrest until suitable buildings or police are in place to keep the populace under control.
Numbers of nations and players.
The game can be played in Single or Multiplayer ([http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotseat_%2528multiplayer_mode%2529](hotseat)) or Supervisor mode with a total of 1 to 15 player nations: computer-controlled players, human players, or both. The opening screen offers three difficulty levels, with the option of specifying the level for each AI or human player. 
Map.
The game map, with isometric tiles and Arctic and Antarctic regions (just as for [Civ2](Civ2)), can be any one of a wide range of sizes (the largest about eight times the size of the smallest), and can be randomly generated (with the percentage of land tiles selected by a player) or designed (one tile at a time) by a human player, with an easy interface for design and the ability to save a map under a new name for future selection.
Most of the popup windows appear superimposed on the main map and can be moved around if you drag them by their title bars. Here's a picture of the report of a fairly productive city at the start of a turn where cities that have experienced some notable change are displayed one at a time:
