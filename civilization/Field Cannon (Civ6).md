# Field Cannon (Civ6)

The Field Cannon is an [Industrial%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Industrial Era) [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Ranged](ranged unit) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It upgrades from the (or its replacements), the , or the .
Strategy.
Refinements in cannon-casting techniques bring along the terrifying field artillery! With 20 more Combat Strength and Ranged Strength than its predecessor, the Field Cannon is a big step up from the Crossbowman. Its far-reaching cannonballs can devastate [Knight%20%28Civ6%29](Knights), do serious damage to [Musketman%20%28Civ6%29](Musketmen) and [Pike%20and%20Shot%20%28Civ6%29](Pikes and Shots), and are reasonably effective against [Cavalry%20%28Civ6%29](Cavalry) and the defenses of most Industrial-era [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities). Take advantage of their range and power to earn them a few s before upgrading them.
However, due to the ever-changing landscape of war, the Field Cannon is now relegated back to a defensive role more than an offensive one. The introduction of [Bombard%20%28Civ6%29](Bombards) to replace the outdated [Trebuchet%20%28Civ6%29](Trebuchets) means that ranged units like Field Cannons are not required to aid in city siege like Crossbowmen are, which is the single reason why you see Crossbowmen everywhere in the [Medieval%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Medieval Era) but not necessarily Field Cannons in the Industrial Era. (Read more [Crossbowman%20%28Civ6%29%23Strategy](here).) Of course, you can still upgrade all the Crossbowmen you have into Field Cannons and bring them with you on conquests to shoot down units, but if you have to train a Field Cannon from scratch, it's probably because you need to garrison s for defensive purposes, or because you lack to train Bombards for city siege. For offensive purposes, there is almost always a better way to spend your 330 , provided that you have the necessary [Resource%20%28Civ6%29%23Strategic](strategic resources).
