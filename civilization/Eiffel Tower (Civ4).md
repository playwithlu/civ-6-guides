# Eiffel Tower (Civ4)

Strategy.
[Broadcast%20Tower%20%28Civ4%29](Broadcast Towers) provide a high amount of culture, so the Eiffel Tower is a highly desirable wonder for players seeking a [Victory%20%28Civ4%29%23Cultural](cultural victory). If some of the high-culture [City%20%28Civ4%29](cities) have low production, getting the Eiffel Tower built will save those cities time which would be spent building Broadcast Towers.
