Terrain feature found on [Desert%20%28Civ5%29](Desert) tiles.

An Oasis is great news for a [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilization) which needs to establish a [City%20%28Civ5%29](city) in the desert. Although it can't be improved, its base yield is already good: it provides the precious {{Food5}}, a very rare commodity in desert areas, and it is the only terrain feature which still yields {{Gold5}} in "". This makes Oases very valuable in the early and middle game - try to include them in your [Borders%20%28Civ5%29](borders) ASAP.
