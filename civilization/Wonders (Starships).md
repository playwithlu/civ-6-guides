# Wonders (Starships)

Wonders in "[Sid%20Meier%27s%20Starships](Sid Meier's Starships)" directly help your ships get the upper hand in battles. Each planet may be able to build one particular wonder, or no wonder at all. The "building plans" are not, however, unique across the galaxy, but multiple planets may have the possibility to build the same wonder. Only one copy of each wonder may exist in the entire galaxy, though. It follows that you cannot count on eventually being able to build a certain wonder just because you control a planet that can build that wonder. Another faction may also control a planet that can build that wonder, and they may build it before you do. Wonders are paid in Metal just like normal [planetary%20improvements%20%28Starships%29](planetary improvements).
