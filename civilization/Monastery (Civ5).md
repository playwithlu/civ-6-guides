Strategy.
Vanilla.
The Monastery is an excellent source of {{Culture5}} for cities that have access to {{Wine5}} and/or {{Incense5}}.
Gods &amp; Kings and Brave New World.
In the expansions for "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)", Monasteries are unique among religious buildings, because they don't boost {{Happiness5}} as the others do. On the other hand, if there are sources of {{Wine5}} or {{Incense5}} nearby, each of them receives a +1 bonus to {{Culture5}} and {{Faith5}} potential! When added to the Monastery's own bonus, this could add up to quite a lot of faith and culture from a single building! Of course, this bonus effect is wasted in cities that have neither of these resources.
The Monastery's bonus seems somewhat lesser than other religious buildings, but Monasteries are cheaper to purchase than other religious buildings, which frees up {{Faith5}} for other uses.
Note that you can only purchase a Monastery in one of your own cities in which your faith is the majority (i.e. it has your religious symbol to the right of its name).
