# Settler (Civ5)

Game Info.
Civilian unit for expanding your empire.
Strategy.
The Settler is used to [Settling%20a%20city%20%28Civ5%29](found) a new [City%20%28Civ5%29](city). All [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilizations) and [City-state%20%28Civ5%29](city-states) begin the game with at least one Settler, but city-states (and [Venetian%20%28Civ5%29](Venice)) cannot produce more. To build new Settlers, a city must have at least 2 Citizens. On lower [Difficulty%20level%20%28Civ5%29](difficulties) Settlers can also be found in [Ancient%20Ruins%20%28Civ5%29](Ancient Ruins).
While a city is producing Settlers, growth is paused. This prevents a city from growing during Settler production but also prevents it from starving. Any surplus in the city is converted into at a diminishing rate, with a point of granted at the first, second, fourth, and eighth surplus and every fourth onward. This conversion process helps reduce the negative impact of Settler production in cities with more excess , so that it is not always optimal to produce a Settler in a city with the most and least excess .
Like other non-military units, Settlers cannot defend themselves and are easily captured unless protected by a combat unit. A Settler captured by a different civilization immediately becomes a [Worker%20%28Civ5%29](Worker).
