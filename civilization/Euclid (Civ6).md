# Euclid (Civ6)

Euclid is a {{Link6|Classical Era}} [Great%20Scientist%20%28Civ6%29](Great Scientist) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Unique ability.
Triggers the {{Eureka6}} for [Mathematics%20%28Civ6%29](Mathematics) and 1 random {{Link6|technology}} from the {{Link6|Medieval Era}}.
Strategy.
If you're playing under the "" ruleset and have built the [Great_Library_%28Civ6%29](Great Library), there's almost no reason to recruit Euclid. The Great Library will already give you the {{Eureka6}} for Mathematics and every other [Ancient%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Ancient) and [Classical%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Classical) technology. When another player recruits Euclid, the Great Library will give you the {{Eureka6}} for another technology, which is guaranteed to be from at least the Medieval Era.
