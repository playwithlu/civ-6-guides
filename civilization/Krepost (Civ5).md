Strategy.
In addition to training your units, the Krepost increases the city's rate of cultural border growth by 33 percent, allowing fast territorial expansion for the Russian player early on. It's quite worthwhile to construct these useful buildings in all Russian cities, but especially in cities on the civilization's frontiers.
