# Federation (Civ6)/Civilopedia

The Commonwealth of Australia formed at the dawn of the 20th Century. Australians gained a national identity, a less confusing tariff policy, and essential governmental institutions (Parliament and a High Court). They also gained Canberra, a national capital partially designed to keep Melbourne and Sydney from arguing for the privilege.
