# Al-Qayrawan (Civ6)

Al-Qayrawan is a religious [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-state) from the [Vikings%2C%20Traders%2C%20and%20Raiders%21%20%28Civ6%29](Vikings, Traders, and Raiders!) [List%20of%20scenarios%20in%20Civ6](scenario) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
Because the player cannot obtain {{Envoy6}}s in Vikings, Traders, and Raiders!, it is not possible to interact with Al-Qayrawan diplomatically. As such, the city-state does not provide any {{Envoy6}} or [Suzerain%20%28Civ6%29](Suzerain) bonuses.
