Strategy.
The Ranger is an Industrial recon unit, which pretty much sums up how useful this unit can be: you shouldn't need to do much scouting at this point in the game, and if you do, a Scout should still be able to handle it. [Combat%20%28Civ6%29](Combat)-wise, it has the same Ranged Strength as the [Field%20Cannon%20%28Civ6%29](Field Cannon) that also becomes available in this [Era%20%28Civ6%29](era), but its cost is higher and its lower and Combat Strength make it inferior on both offense and defense. Under the [vanilla](vanilla) ruleset, chances are good that you'll ignore the Ranger unless you're swimming in and have nothing better to spend it on than upgrading your Scouts.
With the introduction of Spec Ops in "Rise and Fall", the Ranger can actually serve as an [XP](XP) stepping stone for the top-tier recon unit, which is pretty decent in combat thanks to its outstanding maneuverability.
Bugs.
Rangers are incorrectly affected by modifiers that affect ranged units, such as the [Coursers%20%28Civ6%29](Coursers) . However, this also allows them to be used with [Ambiorix%20%28Civ6%29](Ambiorix's) [List%20of%20leader%20abilities%20in%20Civ6](leader ability).
