# Worker (CTP1)

Workers are the citizens of a {{LinkCTP1|city}} who work on a tile to generate {{LinkCTP1|food}}, {{LinkCTP1|production}} or {{LinkCTP1|gold}}. Workers collect resources from tiles or can be turned into {{LinkCTP1|Entertainer}}, {{LinkCTP1|Scientist}}, {{LinkCTP1|Merchant}} or {{LinkCTP1|Laborer}}.

Civilizations have always depended on a stable work-force to work the fields, construct buildings, and mine the hills and mountains.
