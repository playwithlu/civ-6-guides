# Boer (Civ5)/Civilopedia

"Boer" is the Afrikaans word for "farmer" which came to denote the Dutch settlers of the Cape of Good Hope and their descendants. The original Trekboers were primarily Dutch Calvinists who migrated to found settlements in South Africa during the years 1652-1795 while the area was controlled by the Dutch East Indies Company. To avoid British colonialism, most of the Boers in the Cape Colony migrated northward to establish several Boer republics. They fought two wars against the British to defend their independent countries, the Transvaal and the Orange Free State. After the British victory and absorption of the two Boer republics in 1902, a Boer diaspora commenced, which saw many of the Dutch descendants migrate to Argentina, Kenya, Mexico and the southwestern United States. In 1914, the remaining Boers rose in rebellion at the outbreak of World War I; it was forcefully put down amd the ringleaders imprisoned or executed for treason. With that, the last vestiges of the Boers disappeared from history.
