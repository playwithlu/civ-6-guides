# CN Tower (Civ5)

Strategy.
Despite having a seemingly useful bonus, the gained from the CN TowerÂ may not be able to make up for the wonder's cost unless the game lasts enough turns for the increased gained from the growth to make a difference (e.g., in a game played on Marathon [Speed%20%28Civ5%29](speed)). This can be offset by not building [Broadcast%20Tower%20%28Civ5%29](Broadcast Towers) when planning to build this wonder. [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](Civilizations) with a large number of [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities) will enjoy more benefits from the wonder, as well as a greater gain from the free Broadcast Towers.
Note that the Broadcast Towers will go to whichever civilization "owns" the CN Tower. That means that the original builder will lose the free Broadcast Towers if another player captures the city with the CN Tower (and the new owner will gain them), although the increases in and will only be rewarded to the builder. The additional Broadcast Towers awarded when this wonder is completed go to "all" cities controlled by that civilization, even if they have just been captured and are still in resistance. The free Broadcast Tower also goes to any city founded or acquired after the CN Tower has been completed, but, as when the city with the wonder switches hands, there will be no increase in or .
