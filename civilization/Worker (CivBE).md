# Worker (CivBE)

Game Info.
Civilian Unit. Constructs improvements on the land, increasing the effectiveness of tiles when worked by a City's population.
Strategy.
The Worker can construct [Roads%20%28CivBE%29](roads) and [Tile%20improvement%20%28CivBE%29](improvements) to increase a [List%20of%20sponsors%20in%20CivBE](civilization's) productivity. It is a civilian unit, so it must rely on military units to protect it from hostile opponents and [Aliens%20%28CivBE%29](aliens).
Note that the Worker can also construct improvements on water tiles. UnlikeÂ in "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)", you don't need a separate water unit for this; simply embark your Worker and move it over the resource.
Workers cost 200 to purchase.
