# Suleiman (Civ6)

Suleiman I (6 November 1494 – 6 September 1566), commonly called the Magnificent and the Lawgiver, was the tenth , ruling from 1520 until his death, whose reign is considered to have been the apex of Ottoman military, economic and cultural power. He leads the [Ottoman%20%28Civ6%29](Ottomans) in "".
Suleiman and his childhood friend [Ibrahim%20%28Grand%20Vizier%29%20%28Civ6%29](Ibrahim) conquer all opposing empires, becoming especially dangerous by the [Renaissance%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Renaissance Era).
This is the standard version of Suleiman when players do not have the [Great%20Commanders%20Pack%20%28Civ6%29](Great Commanders Pack) enabled. When it is enabled, Suleiman will be split into two alternate [Persona%20%28Civ6%29](personas): [Suleiman%20%28Civ6%29/Muhte%C5%9Fem](Muhteşem Suleiman), with a new appearance and abilities; and Kanuni Suleiman, using his former model and abilities.
Intro.
 All praise to you, Suleiman the lawgiver, rightly called Magnificent! Master of the sublime house of Osman, your loyal servants stand ready to carry your commands to the farthest corner of your mighty land, while your foes tremble at the sight of your armies. Sultan of Sultans and Khan of Khans, lead your people to greatness.
In-Game.
Suleiman's unique [Agenda%20%28Civ6%29](agenda) is Lawgiver. He tries to maintain the [Amenities%20%28Civ6%29](happiness) and [Loyalty%20%28Civ6%29](loyalty) of his [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) and dislikes leaders who have unhappy or disloyal cities or a small number of captured cities.
His [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader ability) is Grand Vizier. It gives him access to the [Janissary%20%28Civ6%29](Janissary) and 1 extra Governor title once he researches [Gunpowder%20%28Civ6%29](Gunpowder), and a unique [Governor%20%28Civ6%29](Governor) named Ibrahim with military and diplomatic abilities.
Detailed Approach.
Their Great Turkish Bombard ability allows the Ottoman to siege even the most powerful city in short order and should ensure those cities remain under Ottoman rule. The unique governor Ibrahim assists these conquests and eases the concerns of foreign powers. Through the [Grand%20Bazaar%20%28Civ6%29](Grand Bazaar) the Ottomans can gain additional [Resources%20%28Civ6%29](resources), helping their armies and cities grow even while conquering. With two [Unique%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](unique units) available in the [Medieval%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Medieval) and Renaissance periods, those times often coincide with the primary wave of Ottoman conquests.
Lines.
Suleiman is voiced by [Yavuz%20Vatansever](Yavuz Vatansever). He speaks using late 19th/early 20th century Ottoman pronunciation rather than the pronunciation of Suleiman's time. For example, when declaring war he pronounces the word "your" as "sizin" with "n" as the final consonant sound, while in Suleiman's time it was pronounced as "sizüng" with "ng" as the final consonant sound. Also, almost all of the sentences have broken grammar and incorrect vocabulary. Despite all of this it's a huge improvement in historical accuracy from [Civilization%20V](the previous installment), where [Suleiman%20%28Civ5%29](Suleiman) spoke plain modern Turkish.
