# Arsenal of Democracy (Civ6)/Civilopedia

A year before Pearl Harbor, in October 1940 AD, President Roosevelt used a radio broadcast to the American public to promise military supplies to beleaguered Great Britain … while the United States stayed out of the actual fighting against all-conquering Nazi Germany. During that broadcast Roosevelt used images of America as the “arsenal of democracy” to argue against the isolationist and non-interventionist doctrine the country had followed since the end of the bloody First World War. In effect, rather than take on the Axis directly, Roosevelt pledged American aid as the principle arms supplier for the Allied effort in total war. Although Roosevelt broke a number of international and American laws to do so, it was pledge he kept.
