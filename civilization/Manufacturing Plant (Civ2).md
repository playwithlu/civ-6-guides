# Manufacturing Plant (Civ2)

The Manufacturing Plant (abbreviated Mfg. Plant) is an economic [List%20of%20buildings%20in%20Civ2](improvement) in "[Civilization%20II](Civilization II)", available with the [List%20of%20advances%20in%20Civ2](advance).
A Manufacturing Plant can be built in a city with a . It increases base Shield output by 50%, for a combined total of 100%. A city with a Factory, Mfg. Plant, and can obtain a maximum production bonus of 150%.
Strategy.
Manufacturing Plants provide their production bonus even without a Factory present. Furthermore, a Mfg. Plant is considered a factory for the purpose of power plant synergy. This means a [Gold%20%28currency%29%20%28Civ2%29](cash)-strapped [Civilizations%20%28Civ2%29](civilization) may prefer to sell off Factories first, as these are cheaper to rebuild (200 vs. 320 for the Mfg. Plant).
When calculating a city's total production output, the Manufacturing Plant's bonus combines with the Factory's "before" rounding. This means a city with an odd Shield yield will gain one extra shield when both improvements are present, as per the following equation:
where is the city's Shield yield; , and each equal when a Factory, Mfg. Plant, and/or power plant are present, respectively; and is the final bonus Shield output. So a city with an 11 yield, a Factory, and a Mfg. Plant will gain
for a total of 22 , whereas a city with an 11 yield, a Factory, and a power plant will gain only
for a total of 21 .
Civilopedia entry.
Manufacturing plants are large industrial complexes that produce goods of all types, although they are generally used to produce durable consumer goods such as automobiles. Essentially, a manufacturing plant is a large, sophisticated factory that employs specialization of labor, complex machinery, and assembly lines to gain efficiency and economies of scale. This combination of manpower and automation increases productivity and reduces production costs.
