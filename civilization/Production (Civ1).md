# Production (Civ1)

 Production in "[Sid%20Meier%27s%20Civilization](Sid Meier's Civilization)" is represented by and referred to as Shields. Production is used to produce units and buildings- the more production in a city, the faster a unit or building is constructed.
Under some [Government%20%28Civ1%29](governments), units require a certain amount of production each turn to stay alive. This is marked by placing a single shield to the left of the 'free' production, per shield consumed by unit. More units produced by a city require more production to stay alive. Production used to maintain units is not used when producing more units and buildings.
Production is produced when a citizen works a [Plains%20%28Civ1%29](plains), [Mountain%20%28Civ1%29](mountain), [Forest%20%28Civ1%29](forest), resourced [Grassland%20%28Civ1%29](grassland), [Swamp%20%28Civ1%29](swamp) (with [Oil%20%28Civ1%29](oil)), or [Hills%20%28Civ1%29](hill) (with [Mine%20%28Civ1%29](mines)) tile. This can be increased by building mines (if possible on the terrain type) or [Railroad%20%28Improvement%29%20%28Civ1%29](railroads) on the worked tiles, or building [Factory%20%28Civ1%29](factories) and [Mfg.%20Plant%20%28Civ1%29](Mfg. Plants), and [Nuclear%20plant%20%28Civ1%29](nuclear), [Hydro%20Plant%20%28Civ1%29](hydro), or [Power%20Plant%20%28Civ1%29](power plants) to further increase production.
Too much production can result in [Pollution%20%28Civ1%29](pollution), which can be cleaned up [Settlers%20%28Civ1%29](settlers) and reduced by nuclear or hydro plants, or [Recycling%20Center%20%28Civ1%29](recycling centers).
