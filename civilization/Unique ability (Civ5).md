# Unique ability (Civ5)

Unique abilities are a new feature added into "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)" that give [civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilizations) certain bonuses. Unique abilities were made to replaceÂ [Leader%20trait%20%28Civ4%29](traits) from "[Civilization%20IV](Civilization IV)" (most likely to make civilizations more unique instead of two civilizations sharing one similar bonus).
All updates made to unique abilities in ' apply to ' as well.
