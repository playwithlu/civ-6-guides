When scientists developed ultra-pressure machinery near 2700 AD they removed the hurdle that would allow watercraft to safely reach high-subsonic speeds. Hundreds of times more efficient than hydrofoil technology, Ultrapressure created a cushion of air that eliminated the friction between ship and water. The Plasma Destroyer moved with grace across the seas while carrying the world's most destructive conventional armament of the 27th century. Its speed, weaponry, and lack of rival made Plasma Destroyers a pivotal weapon in American dominance over the Pacific and Atlantic oceans for 20 years.
