Lines.
Suleiman is voiced by [Yavuz%20Vatansever](Yavuz Vatansever). He speaks using late 19th/early 20th century Ottoman pronunciation rather than the pronunciation of Suleiman's time. For example, when declaring war he pronounces the word "your" as "sizin" with "n" as the final consonant sound, while in Suleiman's time it was pronounced as "sizüng" with "ng" as the final consonant sound. Also, almost all of the sentences have broken grammar and incorrect vocabulary. Despite all of this it's a huge improvement in historical accuracy from [Civilization%20V](the previous installment), where [Suleiman%20%28Civ5%29](Suleiman) spoke plain modern Turkish.
