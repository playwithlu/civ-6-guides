# Elite Forces (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Josef Stalin is said to have coined the phrase “Quantity has a quality all its own,” but that hasn’t stopped military forces throughout the ages from trying to get their hands on the best-quality tools of warfare and training that they can. Beginning with the Egyptian chariot archer in antiquity, the most effective troops of an era often required expensive equipment and long training to achieve their effects. The French knight of the high Middle Ages is another example, the result of superior equipment and long training. Come to the present day and the small teams of special operations troops in the field, backed by the high technology of airstrikes, drones, and battlefield surveillance. Sometimes quality of equipment and training is the difference between victory and defeat.
