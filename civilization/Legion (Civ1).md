The Roman Legion, created during the early wars of the Republic and tested during the three great Punic Wars with Carthage, was the fighting force that conquered and held an empire for five centuries. Nearly unstoppable in the attack, the Legion was relatively weak on defense, especially in broken ground. Its demise as a military formation was accelerated by the destruction of the Emperor Valens' army by Gothic Knights in the 4th century.
