The Mahabodhi (Buddhist [Religious%20shrine%20%28Civ4%29](Shrine)) produces one gold each turn for every [City%20%28Civ4%29](city) in the world that practices [Buddhism%20%28Civ4%29](Buddhism). It also spreads Buddhism throughout the world and increases its city's chance of generating a [Great%20Prophet%20%28Civ4%29](Great Prophet).
