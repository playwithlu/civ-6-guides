# Construction Ship (Civ4)/Final Frontier/Civilopedia

The Construction Ship is the laborer of the vast expanse of space. Tasked with the job of building all of man's projects beyond the reach of planet-based equipment, the Construction Ship is vital to the development of a proper space empire. Their use was limited in the early years of human interstellar colonization, but as more elaborate space-based structures were required to develop and maintain its new Colonies, the PDE was forced to invest in these expensive, but necessary vessels. Capable of completing a number of tasks, the Construction Ship can build Warp Lanes and Jump Lanes, which decrease the travel-time of all starships. Extraction Facilities, built by Construction Ships, are required to exploit resources found in Asteroid fields. And finally, the mighty Starbase must be built by these ships.
