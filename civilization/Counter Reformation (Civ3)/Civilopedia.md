# Counter Reformation (Civ3)/Civilopedia

The period from 1560 (when Pope Pius IV took office) until the end of the Thirty Years' War was one of great revival and 
reform in the Catholic church. This Counter-Reformation was in direct response to the Protestant Reformation fueled by the
works of Martin Luther and John Calvin earlier in the 16th Century. A key highlight of the Catholic Counter Reformation was
the founding of the Jesuit Order by Ignatius Loyola (which led to an increase in Catholic teaching and missionary work world-wide, including in the New World).
