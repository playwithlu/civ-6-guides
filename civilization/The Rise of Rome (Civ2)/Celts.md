Quick game.
"Chieftan" level. Talk to Carthaginians, suggesting knowledge exchange: they tell us they are far superior but give us [Map%20Making%20%28Civ2%29](Map Making). They agree to exchange of ambassadors. They have 20 advances: what we have plus Cnst, Math, Mona, Poly, Pott, Seaf, Trad. Aggressive [Monarchy%20%28Civ2%29](Monarchy) with 300 gold and 10 military units; [ceasefire%20%28Civ2%29](ceasefire) with Romans, war with Ind Greeks.
We kill the bribed chariot and kill a phalanx in Pella. Pay 100 to bribe Mac diplomat near Sparta. Change "build" orders to settlers or barracks except where one has a barracks and seems to need to continue with a phalanx.
Hut near Milan: Legion. Our power is now "Pathetic". Hut east of La Tene: The [Republic%20%28Civ2%29](Republic). Dissidents in Athens will revolt for 1057; steal Seafaring. Second Dipl establishes embassy: Mac have 215 gold and 18 military, with 22 advances; at war with us and Hannibal; ceasefire with Scipio and Ptolemy. Peace with Independents (as a catapult approaches Galatia); no exchange of knowledge but we swap ambassadors; they have 351 gold and 24 military and 22 advances; at war with Scipio and Hannibal, ceasefire with Antiochus. Hut north-east of Galatia: 50 gold.
Hut west of Braunsberg on river: tribe! Call it Danubetribe275. 
Romans want us to cancel treaty with Independents: No! They demand seafaring: No! War (with Carthage support). Hut east of Braunsberg: [Mathematics%20%28Civ2%29](Mathematics). Seleucids talk: peace; we get Cnst for Repu and Mona for Seaf; exchange ambassadors; they have 416 gold, 16 military, 23 advances. Now choose [Iron%20Working%20%28Civ2%29](Iron Working). We have 18 advances.

Capture Abdera (was size 4, now size 1), take 17 gold. It has a barracks. Macedonians suggest peace: OK (as you would agree, with an enemy phalanx waiting to attack your size-1 city that has only a warrior in it!). 
Build WSpain261 with [wheat%20%28Civ2%29](wheat) and [silk%20%28Civ2%29](silk) on [river%20%28Civ2%29](river). Hut west of Numantia: Horsemen.

[Bridge%20Building%20%28Civ2%29](Bridge Building). 
Romans ask for peace and their [Great%20Wall%20%28Civ2%29](Great Wall) enforces it. Exchange ambassadors: they have 232 gold and 17 units and 22 advances. Civilized Expansionist [Republic%20%28Civ2%29](Republic) at war with Hannibal and at peace with Independents. (saved as V-b253) Now we are not at war with anybody! Build DanubeDelta253 (rivers, whale, hill) and DanubeIron253 (overlapping a little with UprDanube and Danubetribe). 
Hut S-E of Milan: abandoned. 
Build MidEbro247. Hut east of Numantia: [Philosophy%20%28Civ2%29](Philosophy). Hut S-W of Braunsberg: abandoned. 
[Engineering%20%28Civ2%29](Engineering). 900,000 citizens (actually 35). 
Capture Pisae and 42 gold. Did I mention that our incursions had goaded the Romans into breaking the ceasefire? Then we had sacrificed a few units to weaken the defence. It has granary and marketplace (sold). 
1,000,000 citizens. Hannibal talks: we get Astr for the Republic and Poly for Phil and Trad for Iron and Pott for Brid. We have 780 gold - let's increase the research: 60/40 instead of 40/60. Dissidents in Massilia will revolt for 1602. 
Hut near Massilia: Feudalism. 
Largest civs: us, Indep, Seleucid, Carthage, Rome, Ptolemaic, Macedon. 
Invention. "Discoveries Every 14 Turns". Hut west of Massilia: 50. 
Goaded Romans again; capture Sena and 56 gold. Hut in Gascony holds barbarians. 
Ptolemy talks: we get [University%20%28Civ2%29](University) for Invention. Pergamum[8] will revolt for 1380. Steal [Navigation%20%28Civ2%29](Navigation). Indep and Ptol declare war on us. 
Old barracks sold for 440. [Gunpowder%20%28Civ2%29](Gunpowder). Build Istanbul229. Athens will revolt for 1680. Hut in N-W France: nomads. 
Capture Massilia[4] and 227 gold. Cheaper than bribery. Sell harbor - no value at present. 
Hut in north France: nomads. 
Delphi revolts for 704; 234 change! - [Oracle%20%28Civ2%29](Oracle). Sell marketplace.
[Metallurgy%20%28Civ2%29](Metallurgy): three Roman cities lose walls. Capture Rhodes, [Colossus%20%28Civ2%29](Colossus), and 458. Sell marketplace. It must have lost its harbor because it has a food deficit of 3; fortunately it has a granary. 
2,000,000 or 76. Capture Pergamum and 301. Sell marketplace, keep granary. 
Build Paris221. Hut on Rhone or Saône: 50. Road network complete from UprDanube-La Tene-Rome and beyond

Build Rhone215 and Orleans215.

[Leadership%20%28Civ2%29](Leadership); talk to Seleucids and get [Banking%20%28Civ2%29](Banking) for Invention (their choice; they could have had Gunpowder). Talk to Seleucids, get Medi for Navi. Demand tribute for our patience and get 1150! Now we can't declare war on them - but we can still annoy them.
CAPTURE ROME and 157 gold. 
[Democracy%20%28Civ2%29](Democracy).

Explosives. 5,000,000 or 172. Build W1-175. Capture Hangchow[1] and 9 gold. Hut east of Black Sea: 50 on first run but barbarians on second run. Egyptians offer 2000 for ceasefire: OK. On first run, captured Syracuse - but then remembered that they are researching Physics, so we reran the turn.
Coal from UprDanube266 reaches Tarracina (after having turned back from a voyage to Carthage when Carthage stopped wanting coal): 15 gold, but both are earning 0 per turn at present.
Hut east of Black Sea: Musketeers. REVOLUTION (maybe long overdue). 
Hut north of Xinjian: barbarians. Build FrenchCoal171 (2 coal, 1 iron, at river source). Lost a trireme at sea (having forgotten what game I was playing; it's a miracle it had reached Africa safely and delivered a passenger) - but the sinking also took a caravel and passenger on the same spot.
MONARCHY, and the number of automatically content citizens rises to 5, which will ease problems for some cities. Capture Xinjian[2] and 14 gold.
Sanitation. Funny thing - the only city in the world that wants coal is FrenchCoal171. Hut north-west of Caspian: barbs. Hut north of Hecatompylos: 100 gold. Capture Chengdu[2] and 16 gold.
Theory of Gravity. Now if we want help with Physics we should slow down research (not wanting Theology or Fundamentalism). Capture Tientsin[1] and 13 gold. Capture Valladolid[3] and 30 gold. 
Build EastItaly165 on cape with whale and fish.
Build Prague164. 
Hut west of Massilia: Riflemen. Capture Damascus[6] and 52 gold.

Gold from S1 to Hippo Regius: revenue 132; and S1 is getting 3 per turn.
Build Zagreb158.
Capture Cyrene[2] and 21 gold. And we seem to be down to "4 content" again for some cities but not others. Hut south-east of Memphis: 50.
"Carthaginians" develop Physics; so no need to wait for Indep. Talk to carthaginians, get Physics for Conscription - and The Great Library continues so that the Egyptians/Ptolemaics get both. Then our faithful friends want more, and when we say no they cancel the alliance. Not a problem - apart from some unexpected unit homings! Switch back to 70% research.
Build Catanzaro154 (yes, the 3-bonus hill in the toe of Italy). (Saved V_b154.)
Magnetism. Hut west of Kuwait: Riflemen.
Electricity (cancels Great Library). Coal from Galatia to Carthage: revenue 112 plus 3 per turn.
Steam Engine. Build Trafalgar149 using the wheat and bison north of Gades. Independent Gr develop Physics at last. 
Railroad. Build Basque147 with coal and iron.
+;146
Industrialization. 
Communism. 
Steel. Silver from Rhone to Alexandria: revenue 112 plus 3 per turn.
Machine Tools. 
The Corporation.
Refining.
Combustion.
Automobile.
Mobile Warfare; old barracks sold for 880.
Electronics.
Miniaturization.
Mass Production. Caravels are no longer a safe method of transport. Ptolemaic caravel sinks our caravel that was about to disembark two caravans.
Computers. Time for Communism for 80% science, zero curruption, and stronger police with the only long-term disadvantage being that our 7 settlers and 37 engineers will eat more (contrary to what the on-screen help says). Short-term disadvantage is some civil disorder owing to the anarchy; we enrol a few entertainers and rush-build a few cathedrals.
COMMUNISM. Nice short period of anarchy; and the number of citizens automatically content seems to have risen to 6. All of the half dozen cities that were in disorder are now OK and can have their entertainers back doing real work. Coal from S1[6] to Antioch[10]: revenue 60 plus 2 per turn for S1 and 2 for Antioch.
Robotics.
Peace with Ptolemaics, and 500 gold tribute. Espionage. Build Crete124 (west end). Silver from Numantia[7] to Antioch[10]: revenue 68 plus 2 per turn for Antioch and Numantia; Antioch now has three trade routes and should probably not be used again because it would gain no extra per-turn income.
Recycling. We have sold all of our courthouses, in case you were wondering; no plans for any further change of government. (saved as V_b123.sav)
