# Volunteer Army (Civ5)/Civilopedia

A standing Volunteer Army is one that draws its manpower from volunteers rather than conscription or mandatory service; generally found in democracies, the voluntary military offers attractive pay, incentives and benefits to recruit and retain its servicemen. Most countries with volunteer armies also have conscription laws in place for use in the event of a national emergency.
