# Mvemba a Nzinga (Civ6)

Mvemba a Nzinga (c. 1456 – 1542 or 1543), baptized Afonso I, was the sixth of the , ruling from 1509 until his death. He is known for his conversion to [Christianity](Christianity) and spread of the religion through his kingdom after the arrival of the [Portuguese](Portuguese) in Kongo, but also for his stern condemnation of the Portuguese in his many letters sent to kings and [Jo%C3%A3o%20III%20%28Civ6%29](João III). He leads the [Kongolese%20%28Civ6%29](Kongolese) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Mvemba's Kongo is a land of apparent paradoxes: a religious civilization without generation or [Holy%20Site%20%28Civ6%29](Holy Sites), and one that can grow to a huge Population in the middle of the [Rainforest%20%28Civ6%29](Rainforest).
Intro.
 Mother Earth has many gifts for you, King Mvemba a Nzinga. Your people know the dense woods and rainforests as their homes, and glide through them with ease. Great also are the gifts that come from travelers of distant lands. Keep an open mind, for the inspiration of the open world will let our people create art with power and majesty.
In-Game.
Mvemba a Nzinga's unique [Agenda%20%28Civ6%29](agenda) is Enthusiastic Disciple. He likes leaders who spread their [Religion%20%28Civ6%29](religion) to his [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) and dislikes leaders who have founded a religion and have not brought it to his cities.
His [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader ability) is Religious Convert. He may not build Holy Site [District%20%28Civ6%29](districts), gain [Great%20Prophet%20%28Civ6%29](Great Prophets), or found a religion. However, he receives an [Apostle%20%28Civ6%29](Apostle) (of that city's majority religion) each time he finishes a [Mbanza%20%28Civ6%29](Mbanza) or [Theater%20Square%20%28Civ6%29](Theater Square) district in one of his cities.
Bugs.
While he is also supposed to receive all the [Beliefs%20%28Civ6%29](beliefs) of any religion that is established in a majority of his cities, the ability does not work and seemingly never has.
Detailed Approach.
Kongo's initial push is to grab as much Rainforest or [Woods%20%28Civ6%29](Woods) as they can get (which shouldn't be a problem unless [Brazilian%20%28Civ6%29](Brazil) is nearby). Using the Mbanza (which provides plentiful as early as the [Medieval%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Medieval) [Era%20%28Civ6%29](era)) and from these Rainforest or Woods [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles), they are able to grow large cities quickly. Mvemba will also pick the largest Religion in the game and get it spread into the majority of his cities so Kongo can duplicate all of the Belief bonuses (without having had to generate a single point of )! If they do end up with , they can use it to patronize [Great%20People%20%28Civ6%29](Great People), augmenting their Nkisi civilization ability that already allows them to generate plenty of [Great%20Work%20%28Civ6%29](Great Works) with highly enhanced yields. By combining bonus yields from Religion and Great Works, they can be a contender for any victory, though [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Culture) is a perfect fit.
