# Peter Minuit (Col)

Peter Minuit is one of the "[Colonization%20%281994%29](Colonization)" [Founding%20Fathers%20%28Col%29](Founding Fathers), from the Trade category. When Minuit is in your Congress, [Indians%20%28Col%29](Indians) will no longer demand payment for their land.
Minuit is one of the most important early game Fathers, because he allows you to settle or work on land that would otherwise be unavailable. However, just because you can take the natives' land for free doesn't mean they'll be happy about it...
Director-general of the Dutch West India Company's colony in America, he bought the Island of Manhattan from the Indians for $24...!
