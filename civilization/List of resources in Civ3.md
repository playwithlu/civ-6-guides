# List of resources in Civ3

Strategic and Luxury resources can be connected to your empire with a road. The tile must be inside your territory, or a [Worker%20%28Civ3%29](worker) can build a [colony%20%28Civ3%29](colony) on it. These two types of resources can be traded with other civilizations. Some strategic resources can be "depleted", forcing you to find a new source.&lt;br&gt;
For a city to use bonus resources, they must be within the city's [big%20fat%20cross](big fat cross). That city benefits from the resource.
