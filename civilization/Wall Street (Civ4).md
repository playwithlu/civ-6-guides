# Wall Street (Civ4)

Strategy.
Wall Street doubles its [City%20%28Civ4%29](city's) production of wealth and increases its chances of generating a [Great%20Merchant%20%28Civ4%29](Great Merchant).
This wonder synergizes well with [Religious%20shrine%20%28Civ4%29](Shrines) and [Corporation%20%28Civ4%29](corporate headquarters). Build this wonder in the holy city of a popular [Religion%20%28Civ4%29](religion) if you own it, and incorporate corporations in the city with this wonder.
