# Inquisitor (promotion) (Civ6)/Civilopedia

An inquisitor is simply one who asks a question. But, since the Spanish Inquisition, the term has become associated with those who seek to discover heretical beliefs and eliminate them. If one has a sacred message, it follows that one must eliminate opposing messages.
