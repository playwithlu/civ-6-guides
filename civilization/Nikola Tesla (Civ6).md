Unique ability.
This district's regional buildings reach 3 tiles farther.
This district's regional buildings provide +2 {{Production6}}.
Strategy.
The general idea behind using Nicola Tesla is to make a single well-placed [Industrial%20Zone%20%28Civ6%29](Industrial Zone) (or [Entertainment%20Complex%20%28Civ6%29](Entertainment Complex), in [vanilla](vanilla) "Civilization VI" and "") extend the reach of their regional buildings from 6 to 9 [hex](hex)es, ensuring that many cities can benefit from a single district's regional benefits.
The buildings that are affected by Tesla are: 
Choose wisely when picking the location you want to activate Tesla and you will have a large advantage that is not entirely obvious at first glance. This is a great boost if you are playing tall or wide in one location and can be used in many ways:
Remember that the Coal Power Plant grants a lot of bonus {{Production6}}, but its {{Production6}} bonus is only local and doesn't extend to other cities. Its {{Power6}} radius can still be affected by [Mexico%20City%20%28Civ6%29](Mexico City) and Tesla, though.
The most common use of Tesla is in combination with [Magnus%20%28Steward%29%20%28Civ6%29](Magnus') [Vertical%20Integration%20%28Civ6%29](Vertical Integration) title to build up a massive central {{Production6}} hub. The extended range can add 1 more layer of bonus {{Production6}} (2 more if you have the [Mausoleum%20at%20Halicarnassus%20%28Civ6%29](Mausoleum at Halicarnassus)) to the city with Magnus.
A city will only receive the yields of the most advanced building within range, so using Tesla in two different cities will not provide +4 {{Production6}} in the cities that overlap. Similarly, a city with a good Coal Power Plant will not receive the +2 bonus from a Tesla-enhanced Power Plant if it still provides a lesser bonus.
