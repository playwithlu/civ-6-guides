# Pyramids (Civ5)

Game Info.
Requires [Liberty%20%28Civ5%29](Liberty). ()
Strategy.
The Pyramids is one of the earliest wonders available, and it can considerably speed up your early development. Its main effect, faster [List%20of%20improvements%20in%20Civ5](improvement) construction, combines nicely with the similar effect from the Liberty policy tree, but even more important are the free [Worker%20%28Civ5%29](Workers), which will allow you to upgrade your early [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities) with lightning speed. To get a chance at building the Pyramids, adopt Liberty first thing, then research [Mining%20%28Civ5%29](Mining), then finally [Masonry%20%28Civ5%29](Masonry).
On higher [Difficulty%20level%20%28Civ5%29](difficulty levels) (Emperor and above), grabbing land with [Settler%20%28Civ5%29](Settlers) may take a higher priority over this wonder.
