# Chariotry (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Chariotry is believed to have originated in Mesopotamia around 3000 BC. The first four-wheeled chariots pulled
by oxen were used to transport troops to the battle but they dismounted to fight. The later two-wheeled versions
with a light spoked wheel and pulled by horses was considerably faster and more maneuverable than its predecessor.
Spearmen and archers fighting "mounted" inside the chariot provided a superior fighting force.
