# Utopia Project (Civ5)

Game Info.
Special project. Triggers a [Cultural%20victory%20%28Civ5%29](Cultural Victory)!
This wonder cannot be constructed in "", in which the conditions for achieving a Cultural Victory have changed.
Strategy.
Constructing the Utopia Project immediately ends the game, giving its creator a Cultural Victory! So, keep an eye out for any civilizations that start constructing it (there will be a world message similar to the one you get when they finish the [Manhattan%20Project%20%28Civ5%29](Manhattan Project) or [Apollo%20Program%20%28Civ5%29](Apollo Program)), and try to eliminate them or achieve victory before they do. Though you may not have enough time to react...
