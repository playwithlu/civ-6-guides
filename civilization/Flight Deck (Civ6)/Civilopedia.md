# Flight Deck (Civ6)/Civilopedia

The first flight decks were inclined wooden ramps built on the forecastle of a few warships … just in case this “aeroplane thing” proved useful. The first plane to launch from a warship (USS Birmingham) occurred in November 1910; two months later, the first plane to land on a warship platform (USS Pennsylvania) was piloted by Eugene Fly. The first aircraft carrier that actually had a “modern” flight deck was the converted liner HMS Argus, whose upper works had been cut away and a large wooden platform laid over the hull. It was used to experiment with possibilities, including the construction of a starboard “island” to serve as bridge and chartrooms and briefing room and control tower. The flight deck also proved the primary – actually only – place to park the aeroplanes.
