Strategy.
Deserts are normally forbidding places where you should avoid settling, but they present certain unique opportunities. All of the following can only be built in a Desert tile, or in a [City%20%28Civ5%29](city) founded in or adjacent to one:
[Farm%20%28Civ5%29](Farms) "can" be built on Desert tiles, and [Hill%20%28Civ5%29](Hills) in Deserts still provide a yield of 2 . Combined with the effect of [Petra%20%28Civ5%29](Petra), this yields a whopping +3 and +1 , creating one of the most potent terrains in the game.
Additionally, [Flood%20Plains%20%28Civ5%29](Flood Plains) and [Oasis%20%28Civ5%29](Oases) are only found next to or on Desert tiles (respectively). and are also found frequently in Deserts. Again, Petra helps a lot with the yield on these [Resources%20%28Civ5%29](resources) (except on Flood Plains)!
Certain [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilizations), like [Arabian%20%28Civ5%29](Arabia) and Morocco, are "native" to deserts and gain unique benefits from this terrain.
