Strategy.
The Maori Warrior is similar to a [Great%20General%20%28Civ5%29](Great General); however, instead of increasing the strength of friendly units, it decreases the strength of adjacent enemy units. Needless to say, this is very useful in all [Combat%20%28Civ5%29](combat). The Maori are especially useful when clearing out [Barbarian%20%28Civ5%29](barbarian) [Encampment%20%28Civ5%29](encampments) early in the game. Build plenty of these units early as their [Promotions%20%28Civ5%29](promotion) stays with them when they are upgraded.
