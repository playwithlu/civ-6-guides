# Stealth Destroyer (Civ4)/Civilopedia

The elusive element of surprise has brought about deciding victories on land, at sea and in the air for centuries. But in the face of more precise forms of radar developed in the latter half of the twentieth century, new technology was needed to return the tactical advantage stealth once provided.
Beginning in the 1980s, breakthroughs in naval stealth research, such as radar-silent construction materials and simplified superstructures, initiated the creation of the world's first stealth navies. Since that time, France, Sweden and the United States have all adopted their own stealth ships, capable of performing missions while remaining invisible to enemy radar.
