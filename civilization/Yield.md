# Yield

Yield refers to one or more of the numerical statistics given (yielded) to a [city](city) by a [tile](tile) when [work](work)ed by a [citizen](citizen). It encompasses the basic statistics of [food](food), [production](production), and a particular game's economic commodity ([Trade%20%28yield%29](trade)/[commerce](commerce) in earlier games, [Gold%20%28currency%29](gold) in later ones). In later games, additional statistics such as [science](science), [faith](faith), and [culture](culture) can also be yields.
A tile's initial yields are determined by its [terrain](terrain) type. These values are further modified by the [resource](resource) and/or [Tile%20improvement](improvement) present on the tile. [Pollution](Pollution) reduces yields in games that feature it. Certain [government](government)s also affect the gross yields provided to the city.
A city's net yields are based on multiple factors that vary from game to game. [Building](Building)s such as [Bank](Bank)s and [Factory](Factories) can provide multiplicative bonuses, while certain [Great%20Wonder](wonders) such as the [Colossus](Colossus) can give flat increases per tile. Other factors, such as [unit](unit) [maintenance](maintenance) and [Corruption](corruption and waste) mechanics, can reduce the net yields.
