# Yield

A tile's initial yields are determined by its [terrain](terrain) type. These values are further modified by the [resource](resource) and/or [Tile%20improvement](improvement) present on the tile. [Pollution](Pollution) reduces yields in games that feature it. Certain [government](government)s also affect the gross yields provided to the city.
A city's net yields are based on multiple factors that vary from game to game. [Building](Building)s such as [Bank](Bank)s and [Factory](Factories) can provide multiplicative bonuses, while certain [Great%20Wonder](wonders) such as the [Colossus](Colossus) can give flat increases per tile. Other factors, such as [unit](unit) [maintenance](maintenance) and [Corruption](corruption and waste) mechanics, can reduce the net yields.
