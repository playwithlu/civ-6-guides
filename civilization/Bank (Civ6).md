# Bank (Civ6)

The Bank is an advanced [Gold%20%28currency%29%20%28Civ6%29](economic) [Building%20%28Civ6%29](building) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is built in the {{Link6|Commercial Hub}} {{Link6|district}} and requires a {{Link6|Market}} (or one of its replacements).
Strategy.
The Bank is a mid-level building that boosts a city's {{Gold6}} output. The [Great%20Merchant%20%28Civ6%29](Great Merchant) [Giovanni%20de%27%20Medici%20%28Civ6%29](Giovanni de' Medici) can be used to instantly build a Market and a Bank, and the Bank gains 2 [Great%20Work%20%28Civ6%29](Great Work) slots which can be filled by any Great Work including {{Relic6}} Relics.
Building two Banks triggers the {{Eureka6}} for [Economics%20%28Civ6%29](Economics).
In "", each trade [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-state) with 6 or more {{Envoy6}}s gives an additional +4 {{Gold6}} in each Bank.
