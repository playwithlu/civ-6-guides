# Great Lighthouse (Civ5)

Game Info.
City must be built on the coast.
Strategy.
The first sea-based wonder available, the Great Lighthouse is a must for any sea-based [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilization). Its main bonus allows their ships to move faster, which helps both in exploration and battle; its secondary bonuses add a [Great%20Merchant%20%28Civ5%29](Great Merchant) point and a free Lighthouse in the city, so don't build one if you plan to build this wonder!
In order to get a chance at building it, you have to rush Optics, which is quite easy: simply research [Pottery%20%28Civ5%29](Pottery), then [Sailing%20%28Civ5%29](Sailing), then [Optics%20%28Civ5%29](Optics). This path is also preferable for anyone playing on an Archipelago [Map%20%28Civ5%29](map), as your starting island rarely has room for more than one city. You'll also get the [Embarkation%20%28Civ5%29](Embarkation) ability pretty early, and enter the [Classical%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Classical Era) already.
[Venetian%20%28Civ5%29](Venice) should prioritize this wonder after the [Colossus%20%28Civ5%29](Colossus) and the [Mausoleum%20of%20Halicarnassus%20%28Civ5%29](Mausoleum of Halicarnassus) have both been built, as Venice crucially needs an early Great Merchant point.
