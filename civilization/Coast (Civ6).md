# Coast (Civ6)

Coast is a base [Terrain%20%28Civ6%29](terrain) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is found on the continental shelves and everywhere where land meets water, extending up to 3 [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles) away from land.
Strategy.
Compared to earlier "[Civilization%20%28series%29](Civilization)" games, Coast tiles are less useful. The [Harbor%20%28Civ6%29](Harbor) means a [City%20Center%20%28Civ6%29](City Center) can be further inland, and Coast tiles do not provide much when worked unless a [Resource%20%28Civ6%29](resource) is present. As such, it's wise to avoid settling a [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) in a region with an abundance of Coast tiles unless you plan on quickly building a Harbor in that city, which has [Building%20%28Civ6%29](buildings) that improve their yields.
Of course, Coast tiles are the only place where early [Naval%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](ships) may move before researching [Cartography%20%28Civ6%29](Cartography). Thus, a [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) which expands its [Territory%20%28Civ6%29](territory) to cover all Coast tiles in a certain location will effectively block all maritime movement there in the early game for all civs who don't have Open Borders with them. This may often have great strategic importance.
Note that some [Wonder%20%28Civ6%29](wonders) can only be built on the coastline, often next to a Harbor.
Founding a city on the coast unlocks the for [Sailing%20%28Civ6%29](Sailing).
