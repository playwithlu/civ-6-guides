# Airport (C-evo)

An airport will be built fairly late in the average [C-evo](C-evo) game.
Those built near the frontier will be primarily for quick air unit repair.
Those in larger, more central cities are more likely to be used for building air units; if [Line%20Production](Line Production) is in effect, a particular air unit is likely to be built in only one or two airport cities because of the cost of the first one in a line.
