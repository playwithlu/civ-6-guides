Game Info.
Base terrain, forming the world ocean far (1-3 tiles away) from land tiles.
Strategy.
Ocean tiles benefit from the +1 {{Food5}} bonus of the [Lighthouse%20%28Civ5%29](Lighthouse), if they're in range of the [City%20%28Civ5%29](city) with it.
Moving through Ocean tiles is impossible before the [Renaissance%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Renaissance Era) (unless you are playing as [Polynesian%20%28Civ5%29](Polynesia)).
