Studies of Alien Biology started soon after planetfall. Nobody felt secure not knowing what exactly local wildlife consists of, and how could it be damaged, if need be. Preliminary expeditions have proven dangerous enough for people to be clear that humanity needs to know as much as possible for local life, if it is to survive. 
But as studies progressed, scientists were more and more marveled at the ingenuity of nature - of the myriad ways it found to produce life under conditions so different from our own. While alien biology concentrated initially on dissecting indigenous species and learning how their organisms worked, it now started to move forward - into finding ways to adapt human activities to the alien nature. The results were more than promising, and soon brought this science into the forefront of human activity here.
