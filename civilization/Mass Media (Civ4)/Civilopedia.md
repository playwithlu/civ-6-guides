# Mass Media (Civ4)/Civilopedia

Mass media refers to any form of communications that reaches a large number of people. Printing was an important early form of mass media; later additions include the radio, cinema, television, and internet.
Mass media can be an extremely powerful force which can be used in a variety of savory and unsavory fashions. In many times and places, most or all outlets of mass media have been controlled by the state. In the United States, on the other hand, virtually all major forms of mass media are privately owned. The Internet is a new and special form of mass media which is difficult to control, as ownership is shared by everyone who has access to it.
In the Second World War, nations employed sophisticated print, radio and film mass media campaigns to dispense propaganda and to aid their war efforts. Leaders like Adolf Hitler, Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt were masterful speakers whose words - spread through the mass media - changed the world forever.
