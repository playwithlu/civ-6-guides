Entertainment has always provided a distraction for the people, a method of education and a voice for political dissent. Epic stories like the Ramayana both entertained and educated their readers, offering social and moral advice. Later Greek tragedies incorporated additional moral devices: punishment for evil doers and rewards for the just. Through satires, Greek theater also allowed writers to protest against taxes and war.
