# Marco Polo (Civ6)

Marco Polo is a {{Link6|Medieval Era}} [Great%20Merchant%20%28Civ6%29](Great Merchant) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Unique ability.
Grants a free {{Link6|Trader}} unit in this city, and increases {{TradeRoute6}} capacity by 1. Foreign {{TradeRoute6}}s to this city provide +2 {{Gold6}} to both cities.
Strategy.
Marco Polo is easily one of the best Great Merchants in the game. Additional capacity for {{TradeRoute6}}s in and of itself is powerful, and the free Trader unit saves a lot of {{Production6}}. The bonus {{Gold6}} is an added incentive for other [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) to trade with the city in which he is activated, so he has great energy with [Egyptian%20%28Civ6%29](Egypt) and the [University%20of%20Sankore%20%28Civ6%29](University of Sankore). Other trade-focused civs, such as [Portuguese%20%28Civ6%29](Portugal) and [Malian%20%28Civ6%29](Mali), should also make Marco Polo a priority.
