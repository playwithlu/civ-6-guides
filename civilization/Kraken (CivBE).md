# Kraken (CivBE)

Kraken
Game Info.
Colossal alien naval unit. Kraken should be avoided at all costs. 
Strategy.
Krakens spawn in the ocean at first, but may migrate to coastal areas. As a colossal unit, it Pillages improvements on tiles it moves through.
The power of your naval unit or units attacking the kraken in their first volley is important. If you can do enough damage to it with your first attack, that it can only move one space each turn, then you have easily won. Any ship can easily move out of range of it, and then open fire and hit it, in the same turn. It will move next to it the following turn, and then its turn is over, it unable to attack. The ship can keep moving off to leave a space between it and its target, and then firing away, until the creature is dead. Ramming it with an aquatic city also works (and may even give the achievement Ramming Speed).
