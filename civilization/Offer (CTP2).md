# Offer (CTP2)

Gameplay.
Leaders who wish to win favor with rival nations may make an Offer in a diplomatic proposal. An Offer is the opposite of a {{LinkCTP2|Request}}.
Offers may be gifts, such as a {{LinkCTP2|City}}, a sum of {{LinkCTP2|Gold}} or an Advance. They may be agreements, like an Offer to give military support or reduce {{LinkCTP2|Pollution}}. In a proposal, players may combine them with either a {{LinkCTP2|Request}} or a {{LinkCTP2|Treaty}}. One cannot make a proposal comprised of two Offers.
