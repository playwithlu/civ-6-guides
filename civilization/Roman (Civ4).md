# Roman (Civ4)

The Roman people represent a [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ4](civilization) in "[Civilization%20IV](Civilization IV)".
Strategy.
Many players of "Civilization IV" enjoy playing as Rome, though some would consider this to be cheating because of their "overpowered" [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ4%23Unique%20units](unique unit), the [Praetorian%20%28Civ4%29](Praetorian). This is especially evident on an 18 Civs [Map%20%28Civ4%29](map) in "": Rome begins in an amazing starting location (next to [Iron%20%28Civ4%29](Iron) and three food resources), and their proximity to the other [Europe](Europe)an civilizations combined with their Praetorian makes for easy conquest. Once Europe is conquered, expanding south into [Africa](Africa) is easy due to [Hatshepsut%20%28Civ4%29](Hatsheput) and [Mansa%20Musa%20%28Civ4%29](Mansa Musa) not being too military-oriented. From there it is an easy ride to whatever [Victory%20%28Civ4%29](victory) condition suits your mood ([Victory%20%28Civ4%29%23Domination](domination) and [Victory%20%28Civ4%29%23Space%20Race](science) being two of the easier paths).
