Through the Dark Ages that followed the fall of the Roman Empire in Europe, a major influence in the revival of civilization was the Christian Church. Elsewhere, other great religions were also expanding their influence. In recognition of the importance of religion in local affairs, the largest European towns built Cathedrals, centers of religious study and worship, presided over by the local bishop. When completed, Cathedrals became the centers of social and cultural activity, as well as religious worship. They brought great pride, stability, and tradition to their community.
