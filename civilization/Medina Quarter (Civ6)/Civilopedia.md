# Medina Quarter (Civ6)/Civilopedia

All Arab cities with some history left have their medina – an urban residential quarter typically walled, with narrow and maze-like streets, in some places less than a meter (39 inches) wide. To a follower of Islam, the Prophet decreed that a just and ordered city was obligatory, and so the design of medinas reflected communal values, often containing at their heart fountains, mosques, and markets. Because of their winding, narrow streets, they also served as defense against invaders… and they are also free of auto traffic, and usually of motorbikes, and even bicycles as well.
