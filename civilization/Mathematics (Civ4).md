# Mathematics (Civ4)

Strategy.
Mathematics can improve health, growth and production and also help defensive strategy.
Health is improved by building the [Aqueduct%20%28Civ4%29](Aqueduct) building and the [Hanging%20Gardens%20%28Civ4%29](Hanging Gardens) wonder; the latter also increases population. In addition, the production bonus from forest chopping is increased, and [Worker%20%28Civ4%29](Workers) can build Forts, which increase the defensive capability of a tile.
