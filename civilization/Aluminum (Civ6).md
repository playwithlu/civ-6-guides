# Aluminum (Civ6)

Strategy.
In the "" expansion, {{AluminumIcon6}} Aluminum - besides being used to build and maintain aircraft - is also indispensable for the reworked [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Science](Science Victory), as it is used to build the [Lagrange%20Laser%20Station%20%28Civ6%29](Lagrange Laser Station).
The [Future%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Future Era) [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](policy card) [Aerospace%20Contractors%20%28Civ6%29](Aerospace Contractors) grants {{AluminumIcon6}} Aluminum for free! Sadly, it is unlocked very late, with [Exodus%20Imperative%20%28Civ6%29](Exodus Imperative), and it also requires an expensive [Spaceport%20%28Civ6%29](Spaceport). Consider it a backup option in all cases - if you need {{AluminumIcon6}} Aluminum for building airplanes (or [Helicopter%20%28Civ6%29](Helicopters) in "Gathering Storm"), chances are your military is strong enough to "liberate" some.
