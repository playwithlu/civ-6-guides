# Sports Media (Civ6)

Sports Media is an Economic [Policy%20Cards%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
Sports Media takes the [Theater%20Square%20%28Civ6%29](Theater Square) [Adjacency%20bonus%20%28Civ6%29](adjacency bonus) from [Aesthetics%20%28Civ6%29](Aesthetics) and adds an extra from [Stadium%20%28Civ6%29](Stadiums), making it most useful to [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Culture Victory) seekers. The [Greek%20%28Civ6%29](Greeks), (whose unique district, the [Acropolis%20%28Civ6%29](Acropolis), replaces the Theater Square and can have high adjacency bonuses thanks to adjacent [City%20Center%20%28Civ6%29](City Centers) and Entertainment Complexes), [Brazilian%20%28Civ6%29](Brazilians) (whose [Street%20Carnival%20%28Civ6%29](Street Carnivals) replace [Entertainment%20Complex%20%28Civ6%29](Entertainment Complexes) and will most likely be filled with advanced [Buildings%20%28Civ6%29](buildings) at this point in the game) and the [Canadian%20%28Civ6%29](Canadians) (who can build their [Ice%20Hockey%20Rink%20%28Civ6%29](Ice Hockey Rinks) adjacent to Entertainment Complexes with Stadiums for an additional +4 ) have the best incentive to adopt this policy; otherwise, chances are there are better uses for an Economic slot.
