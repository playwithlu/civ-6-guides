# New Deal (Civ6)

New Deal is an Economic [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". In "", it is only available after adopting [Democracy%20%28Civ6%29](Democracy) as a [Government%20%28Civ6%29](government).
Strategy.
In [vanilla](vanilla) "Civilization VI" and "", New Deal's substantial penalty to {{Gold6}} output makes it an off-putting policy at best. "Gathering Storm" removes this penalty, but adds the restriction that it can only be unlocked after adopting Democracy. Since Democracy is already a fine government for players who like forming {{Alliance6}}s and making purchases with {{Gold6}}, New Deal becomes much better for helping their [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) and their economies grow in tandem.
