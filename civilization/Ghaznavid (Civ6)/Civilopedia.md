# Ghaznavid (Civ6)/Civilopedia

This Muslim dynasty would regularly send its Turkic soldiers on campaigns into India, much to the detriment of the Jains, Hindus, and other non-Muslim religions in the region at the time.
In the Eleventh Century, Ghaznavid chronicler Abu Nasr al-Utbi would write that the Sultan would embark on his mission to India to clear out all of those pesky, foreign idols and bring Islam to India.
A century earlier, Mahmud of Ghazni would take a different tack (with a more complicated relationship with Indian Hindus). Ruling from 998 until his death in 1030, Mahmud was known to show a more tolerant hand toward foreign religions, employing Hindu vassals to rule conquered Indian territories.
'Tolerant' doesn't mean gentle, however. Mahmud would invade India 17 times, and in 1027, he would ultimately plunder the Somnath Temple, killing 5,000 Hindus in battle.
