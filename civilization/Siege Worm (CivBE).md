Notes: Siege worms are roving monsters that are initially indifferent to humanity, but may inadvertently pillage your improvements through their activities. Those who learn the ways of the worm (Harmony) may be able to use them for their own purposes, such as attracting them to their enemies' cities with a covert ops "Call Worm Strike " (Dune-style s).
"When you kill the siege worm, you see its skull, and when you pick the skull up you may find a new quest thread that you can pick up and follow, and each time you complete an objective in that thread, you get a little bit of the fiction." - [Will%20Miller](Will Miller)
