# Double Envelopment (Civ6)/Civilopedia

A double envelopment is one of the most devastating maneuvers in warfare, a simultaneous attack on both flanks of an enemy formation, usually carried out by highly mobile elements like light cavalry. Sun Tzu contemplated the art of the "pincer" maneuver, but advised against it since an enemy would likely run before it could be completed; if actually trapped by horsemen, he felt the enemy soldiers would fight all the more ferociously since they were doomed anyway. Nevertheless, the double envelopment was used successfully by the likes of Miltiades at Marathon, Alexander at Hydaspes, and Hannibal at Cannae. And Genghis Khan used a rudimentary sort known as the Mongol "horns." Eventually the Germans perfected it for armored warfare â€“ the blitzkrieg.
