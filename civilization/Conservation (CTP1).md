During the 1970s, as cities expanded, factories grew, and cars dominated the landscape, much of the world experienced the ills of pollution: toxic air and contaminated oceans and water supplies. In this face of visible pollution as well as controversy over global warming and ozone loss, a strong populist environmental movement arose which advocated emissions controls for cars and factories and standards for waste management. Political movements such as the Green movement became increasingly popular, as did mostly non-political groups such as the Sierra Club. Conservation was here to stay.
