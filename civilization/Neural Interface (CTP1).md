# Neural Interface (CTP1)

Neural Interface is an advance in "".
Summary.
The fifth Electrical Advance, the Neural Interface merges the worlds of digital data and human comprehension. With the Bio Memory Chip surgically implanted into the young, science increases by 50% overall. The Sensorium eradicates overcrowding and pollution-related unhappiness. Yet the Bio-chip holds a darker side, embodied in the lurking Cyber Ninja, an agent open to any price.
Great Library entry.
Learning from the mind chip and borrowing atomic resonance techniques, scientists of the middle 24th century developed methods for recording and transferring personalities from body to silicon and back. These methods culminated in the development of the Neural Interface, a system that enabled a person to download" a personality into his own brain. While at first specializing in personality and intelligence exchange, later versions of the machines provided virtual worlds that gave users simulated sensory experience. When used for incarceration, such worlds were altered appropriately.
