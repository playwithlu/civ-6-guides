Although propeller-driven bombers proved their worth many times over in World War II, the bomber came of age with the development of jet propulsion engines. Jet engines made for bigger, faster and higher-flying bombers. Capable of flying more than 10,000 miles without refueling, the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress was unquestionably the most advanced and effective bomber in history. They played a crucial role in every U.S.-involved war or conflict from Vietnam to Operation Desert Fox. Although Stratofortresses are capable of carrying nuclear weapons, they usually carry conventional ordinance.
