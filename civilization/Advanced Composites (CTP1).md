Summary.
Discoveries in the synthesis, manufacture and application of Advanced Composites, the breakthrough materials of the Genetic Age, make space flight and space colonization possible. With the Stealth Bomber to destroy enemies without warning, and the Space Plane to carry soldiers into a new reality, Advance Composites revolutionize the world.
Great Library entry.
Advanced Composites, the most powerful of all plastics, were one of the most important discoveries of the late 20th century. Although early plastics revolutionized manufacturing in the 20th century, advanced aeronautics and space flight demanded stronger, lighter materials. Enter Advanced Composites. From plastics to carbon fiber, resins to injected-foam molding, Advanced Composites made travel and eventually colonization of space possible.
