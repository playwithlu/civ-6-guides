# Observatory (Civ6)

The Observatory is a unique {{District6}} of the [Mayan%20%28Civ6%29](Mayan) [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It replaces the [Campus%20%28Civ6%29](Campus).
Buildings.
The following buildings can be constructed in an Observatory:
Strategy.
Considering how important {{Science6}} and the [Campus%20%28Civ6%29](Campus) are in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)", just having a permanent 50% discount on building Campus alone is really impactful. The Mayan Observatory, instead of gaining adjacency bonuses from [Mountains%20%28Civ6%29](Mountains), [Reef%20%28Civ6%29](Reefs), and [Geothermal%20Fissure%20%28Civ6%29](Geothermal Fissures), gain a Major bonus from each adjacent [Plantation%20%28Civ6%29](Plantation) and a Minor bonus from each adjacent [Farm%20%28Civ6%29](Farm) or {{District6}}. This is the true winning condition of the Maya, since they will race towards a Scientific Victory in a pace that can be matched only by a few other civilizations. Since the Maya has tier 2 starting bias towards Plantation [Resource%20%28Civ6%29](Resources)and tier 1 bias towards [Grassland%20%28Civ6%29](Grassland) and [Plains%20%28Civ6%29](Plains), it is quite simple to get an Observatory with at least +4 {{Science6}} adjacency in every city, since just 1 Plantation and 4 Farms surrounding an Observatory will give it +4 already. This district is also a good reason why the Maya is not afraid of waging early wars to claim land around their {{Capital6}}, since its {{Science6}} potential will help you tremendously in catching up in scientific advancement. The raw potential of this district even eclipses the [Seowon%20%28Civ6%29](Seowon), since it is easy to get it up to the starting adjacency bonus of the Seowon, and it scales upward dramatically with each adjacent Plantation.
