# Unlockables (CivBE and Starships)

Due to an update to the My 2K account system that was not patched into the games, the login feature in both games no longer functions. As such, this interconnectivity is no longer accessible. It is unclear whether or not previously unlocked bonuses and unlockables can still be accessed; but no new unlocks are possible.
"[Sid%20Meier%27s%20Starships](Sid Meier's Starships)" is connected to "" through a my2k account. Players need to log into both games to obtain the rewards. Players can earn unlockables in each game by playing both of them.
Players can also "continue" Beyond Earth games in Starships. Continuing a game will transfer over the number of players, affinities of each player, faction leaders, and diplomatic relations. Players can still customize the map size and victory conditions.
