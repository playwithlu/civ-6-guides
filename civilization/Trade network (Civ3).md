# Trade network (Civ3)

A Trade network is a network of [road%20%28Civ3%29](roads), [railroad%20%28Civ3%29](railroads), [harbor%20%28Civ3%29](harbors) and [airport%20%28Civ3%29](airports) that connect all of your cities together to share strategic and luxury [List%20of%20resources%20in%20Civ3](resources). A [worker%20%28Civ3%29](worker) can be told to create a trade network by selecting the worker and hitting (control+N). The worker will begin to make roads (or railroads if you have the research necessary to make them) and connect all of your cities and the resources inside your [Culture%20%28Civ3%29](cultural) boundaries. If they ever complete this task the worker will become available to be reassigned to another task. More than one worker can work on a trade network together but they will not always work on the same road at the same time.
