Civilopedia entry.
Communism is similar in effect to a monarchy with one important exception.
Under a communist government, corruption is at the same level in all cities.
This makes it especially attractive for empires that are spread over large
distances. Normally in this case, corruption may be overwhelming at the
fringes of the empire. But under communism, corruption may remain manageable.
Communism is equivalent to the monarchy in its ability to allow greater
production than a despotism.
Advisers are Soviets and its leader is known as Comrade.
