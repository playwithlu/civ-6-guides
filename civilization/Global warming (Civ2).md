# Global warming (Civ2)

Global warming can occur when there is too much [Pollution%20%28Civ2%29](pollution) on the [Map%20%28Civ2%29](map). The more polluted [Tile%20%28Civ2%29](tiles) there are on the map, the greater the chances of devastating global warming happening next turn. There is some tolerance for pollution on the map at low levels.
Once triggered, global warming will generally turn [Grassland%20%28Civ2%29](grasslands) into [Plains%20%28Civ2%29](plains), plains into [Desert%20%28Civ2%29](deserts), and tiles near the [Ocean%20%28Civ2%29](ocean) into [Swamp%20%28Civ2%29](swamps). This generally means less productive [Terrain%20%28Civ2%29](terrain) all around.
