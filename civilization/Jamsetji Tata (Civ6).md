# Jamsetji Tata (Civ6)

Jamsetji Tata is an [Great%20Merchant%20%28Civ6%29](Great Merchant) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Unique ability.
 districts provide +10 .
Strategy.
Even for players who aim for a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Cultural Victory), Jamsetji Tata is a very lackluster because he arrives too late to have much of an influence compared to sources like [National%20Park%20%28Civ6%29](National Parks) and [Rock%20Band%20%28Civ6%29](Rock Bands). Tata doesn't really provide much for players except +1 [Historic%20Moment%20%28Civ6%29](Era Score) in the expansions.
