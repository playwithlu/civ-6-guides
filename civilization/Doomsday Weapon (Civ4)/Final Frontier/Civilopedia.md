# Doomsday Weapon (Civ4)/Final Frontier/Civilopedia

In the midst of the manufacturing renaissance brought about by the development of Industrialism, where new manufacturing tools and improved processing techniques were birthed almost daily, one MaKGarry Corp. engineer, Tim M. Kraken, was well on his way towards a very different kind of discovery - the Doomsday Weapon. A combination nuclear warhead/ion ordinance attached to the most advanced delivery system ever created, the Doomsday Weapon entered manufacture in secret, and has been one of the most controversial weapons available ever since. Once unveiled, a new paranoia swept the universe, and the class Scout was rushed into production, with the hope that incoming Doomsday Weapons could be spotted and dealt with long before their terrible payload could be delivered.
