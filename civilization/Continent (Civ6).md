# Continent (Civ6)

A continent is a geopolitical grouping of landmasses. Unlike in earlier games, continents are not strictly defined as a set of continuous land [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles). Instead, "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)" defines continents somewhat arbitrarily even within a large landmass (like [Europe](Europe) and [Asia](Asia) in the real world).
Continents affect certain game mechanics, and an individual tile's continent can be viewed in the associated tooltip. A Continent lens can be used to check continental boundaries. It's possible for a [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) radius to span across continental boundaries; in this case the [City%20Center%20%28Civ6%29](City Center) tile defines which continent the city belongs to. As a general rule, a [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization's) home continent is defined by where its is located, with other continents being foreign continents.
Note that only land tiles are assigned to a continent; sea tiles have their continent listed as "none." Note, however, that islands in large water expanses still belong to a continent, even if they're far from any major landmass. Don't just assume that just because Islands A and B are far from Continent C, they must absolutely belong to a different continent.
