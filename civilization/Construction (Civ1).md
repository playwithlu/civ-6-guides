Civilopedia entry.
Advancing beyond the use of mud bricks and mortar to build homes and walls, ancient engineers responded to the need for stronger, more elaborate structures by developing new techniques and skills in Construction. The preferred building material became stone. These new skills made possible the aqueducts, city walls, palaces, temples, bridges, and roads that still stand today in many places, testaments to the ancient builders. In Civilization, Construction allows Settler units to construct Fortresses.
