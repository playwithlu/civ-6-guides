# Machine Gun (Civ4)

The following units can be upgraded to Machine Guns:
Strategy.
Machine Guns are powerful defensive weapons, especially against enemy [Gunpowder%20unit%20%28Civ4%29](gunpowder units). These units cannot initiate attacks, making them most useful when defending [City%20%28Civ4%29](cities).
If you have few strategic resources, stacking [SAM%20Infantry%20%28Civ4%29](SAM Infantry) with [Anti-Tank%20%28Civ4%29](Anti-Tanks) and Machine Guns inside a city can be a good strategy, as any enemy using [Armored%20unit%20%28Civ4%29](armored units), infantry, or aircraft will face a long and difficult fight.
