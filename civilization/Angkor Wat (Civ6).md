Strategy.
Angkor Wat is a weak and inconsequential wonder. Unlike in "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)", a large Population alone doesn't win you the game, as and per Citizen have been nerfed repeatedly. The extra Citizen and seem nice for small and underdeveloped cities, but for well-established ones, these two bonuses are quite meaningless. This wonder is low on the priority list of both human and [AI](AI) players, so if you're playing with the expansions, you can build it a few [Era%20%28Civ6%29](eras) after it's unlocked to earn [Historic%20Moment%20%28Civ6%29](Era Score) out of it if you have nothing better to do.
