# Angkor Wat (Civ6)

+1 {{Citizen6}} Population in all current [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) when built. 
+1 {{Housing6}} in all cities.
Angkor Wat is a {{Link6|Medieval Era}} {{Link6|Wonder}} in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It must be built adjacent to an [Aqueduct%20%28Civ6%29](Aqueduct).
Strategy.
Angkor Wat is a weak and inconsequential wonder. Unlike in "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)", a large {{Population6}} Population alone doesn't win you the game, as {{Science6}} and {{Culture6}} per {{Population6}} Citizen have been nerfed repeatedly. The extra {{Population6}} Citizen and {{Housing6}} seem nice for small and underdeveloped cities, but for well-established ones, these two bonuses are quite meaningless. This wonder is low on the priority list of both human and [AI](AI) players, so if you're playing with the expansions, you can build it a few [Era%20%28Civ6%29](eras) after it's unlocked to earn [Historic%20Moment%20%28Civ6%29](Era Score) out of it if you have nothing better to do.
