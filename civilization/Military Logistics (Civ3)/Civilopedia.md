# Military Logistics (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Napoleon is credited with the phrase, "An army marches on its stomach." One of his strengths as
a general was his understanding of the importance of logistics. The French army was one of the
best-clothed, fed, and supplied armies of the time, and its successful logistical program ensured
its superiority for many years.
