# Stable (Col)

Stables are built in a colony to increase breeding of [Horse%20%28Col%29](horses). Once the Stable is completed, horse reproduction is doubled.
Mechanics.
Building a Stable doubles the maximum productivity. If you have no food surplus, there will be no effect. But if you have enough food the horse number's growth will go from 2 to 4 per turn if you have at least two but no more than 50 horses in Col1, for example.
Display in Col1.
In Col1 when you have a [Warehouse%20%28Col%29](Warehouse) with no Stable the Warehouse is alone and no horses appear anywhere in the colony (except in the production window). Build a Stable, and the visual effect is a fence in front of the Warehouse and some horses (representing your maximum possible production) in front of that. 
If you build a Stable before a Warehouse, you see a little corral with a pale brown piebald horse inside and some white horses (representing your maximum possible production) in front.
