# Comm Relay (CivBE)

Game info.
The Comm Relay is a utility satellite that provides orbital coverage around it, greatly extending the range that satellites can be deployed. it only occupies one tile of orbital space itself, so it is great to be deployed on the edges of your orbital coverage regularly to allow global coverage. Comm Relays often work well with the Supremacy bonus that gives orbital coverage around Firaxite - you can build a large relay around Firaxite sources.
