# AEGIS Cruiser (Civ3)

&lt;br&gt;
AEGIS Cruisers are nimble and lethal. They can bombard up to two squares away; they have radar so they can see two squares
regardless of blocking terrain; and they can see [Submarine%20%28Civ3%29](submarines) when within their radar range. All in all the AEGIS Cruiser is a formidable warship.
A coastal city needs aluminum and uranium in its Strategic Resource box to build an AEGIS Cruiser.
