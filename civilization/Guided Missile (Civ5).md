Game Info.
Special one-time use [Unit%20%28Civ5%29](unit) of the [Information%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Information Era).
Strategy.
The Guided Missile is a one-shot unit which is destroyed when it attacks an enemy target. The Guided Missile may be based in a player-owned friendly [City%20%28Civ5%29](city), or aboard a [Nuclear%20Submarine%20%28Civ5%29](Nuclear Submarine) or [Missile%20Cruiser%20%28Civ5%29](Missile Cruiser). They may move from base to base or attack an enemy unit or city within their range of 8. See the rules on [Air%20combat%20%28Civ5%29%23Missiles](Missiles) for more information.
Guided Missiles don't cost to maintain, but count towards the storage capacity limit. It is a good idea to fill the entire unused capacity in cities with them, then Rebase them to frontline cities and ships as needed. When used defensively, a city can kill 1 enemy unit with 2-4 missiles. It is even better to use Guided Missiles to kill land and [Naval%20units%20%28Civ5%29](naval units) that can Intercept, then perform Air Strikes with relative impunity.
