Although the Keshig is classified as a ranged cavalry unit, it uses the [List%20of%20promotions%20in%20Civ6%23Ranged%20Units](ranged units' promotion table). Depending on which promotions it's given, it can either be used as an anti-infantry weapon or a siege weapon, and its top-tier promotion will allow it to attack twice per turn. It also has [Escort%20Mobility%20%28Civ6%29](Escort Mobility) by default, so it's good at getting [Great%20General%20%28Civ6%29](Great Generals), [Battering%20Ram%20%28Civ6%29](Battering Rams), and [Siege%20Tower%20%28Civ6%29](Siege Towers) to the front lines of the battlefield in a hurry, especially when considering its can be further bolstered by the [Ordu%20%28Civ6%29](Ordu).
