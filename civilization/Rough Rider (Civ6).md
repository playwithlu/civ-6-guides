Strategy.
The Rough Rider is an excellent unit for Roosevelt's America to train en masse as soon as it becomes available. Its high Combat Strength and mobility allow it to reach and deal with threats quickly, and the it generates by defeating invaders helps speed up America's [Civic%20%28Civ6%29](civic) development. Even when more advanced units become available, keeping a few Armies of Rough Riders on hand to repel attacks by hostile neighbors (or deal the finishing blow to weakened attackers) can be a cost-effective and culturally beneficial way to keep the peace on the [Continent%20%28Civ6%29](continent).
With the bonuses from Roosevelt's leader ability, the Rough Riders are perfect for facing invasions, as they can receive up to 15 extra Combat Strength if fighting on Hills on their home continent. This also means that you can finish conquering everyone else on your continent if you want to. However, you should try not to wipe them out completely, because having more opponents gives you more sources of visiting tourists to expedite your progress toward a Cultural Victory - instead, try to leave your neighbors with only one or two [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) (preferably on a different continent from your ), and make sure they're large enough to avoid succumbing to foreign [Loyalty%20%28Civ6%29](Loyalty) pressure if you're playing with the expansions.
