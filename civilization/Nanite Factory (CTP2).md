Gameplay.
Nanite Factories drastically speed up the manufacturing process. By employing the latest breakthroughs in nano-assembly, the Nanite Factory can construct almost anything, from anything.
Great Library entry.
Before scientists were able to build functional nano-machines, they discovered a way to assemble simple items at the molecular level. Nanite factories sprang up in cities, enabling manufacturers to construct objects out of minerals such as gold, carbon and titanium, as well as organic materials such as wood. Complex objects, such as electrical appliances, could be constructed as well. Later applications of nano-assembly allowed for the manufacture of objects of unorthodox construction, such as sheets of flawless diamond. Nanite construction and nano-assembly revolutionized the manufacturing industry, rendering robotic plants obsolete.
