# Entrenchment (Civ5)/Civilopedia

A field fortification meant to protect infantry from cavalry and missile fire, entrenchments have been used in warfare since the earliest days; during the Civil War, temporary entrenchments were dug during battles, as at Gettysburg, while more elaborate, extensive entrenchments protected strategic cities such as Washington and Richmond.
