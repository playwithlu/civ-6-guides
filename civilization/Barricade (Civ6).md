# Barricade (Civ6)

The Barricade is a special [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](tile improvement) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is exclusive to the [Zombie%20Defense%20%28Civ6%29](Zombie Defense) [Game%20mode%20%28Civ6%29](game mode), introduced in the [Portugal%20Pack%20%28Civ6%29](Portugal Pack). It can be built by a [Builder%20%28Civ6%29](Builder) inside your own or neutral [Territory%20%28Civ6%29](territory).
Strategy.
The Barricade is one of the two early defenses used in the Zombie Defense game mode. In contrast with the [Trap%20%28Civ6%29](Trap), which does higher damage to a single [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tile), the Barricade does light damage to all tiles around it. 
Barricades are generally more useful than traps in wide-open areas, as enemies will often walk around traps or spawn on s closer to your [City%20Center%20%28Civ6%29](City Center). Their small damage is negligible compared to a ranged strike by a city with [Walls%20%28Civ6%29](defenses), but they can attack numerous enemies at once. Overall, you will often find that the space and Builder needed for this improvement can be better used elsewhere.
The upgraded version of this improvement is the [Reinforced%20Barricade%20%28Civ6%29](Reinforced Barricade).
