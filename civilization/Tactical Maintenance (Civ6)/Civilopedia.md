# Tactical Maintenance (Civ6)/Civilopedia

The Englishman Conrad Hal Waddington had been educated as a biologist, and would subsequently be an influential geneticist and philosopher who laid the foundations for "systems biology." But, with the outbreak of World War II, he answered the call and was promptly assigned to operational research for Coastal Command. The command's B-24 Liberator bombers were spending an inordinate amount of time grounded for maintenance; Waddington's team gathered data and concluded that too much time was being spent on preventive maintenance as opposed to repairs necessary to keep the bombers at combat readiness. These findings lead to his concept of "force readiness"; although foregoing regular maintenance might lead to problems with some planes, far fewer were out of action at any given time. In fact, effective flying hours for Coastal Command's bombers increased by around 60%.
