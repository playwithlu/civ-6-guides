An active volcano, Mount Fuji is the highest mountain in Japan. Standing some 12,000 feet high and often wreathed in clouds, its famous snow-capped silhouette can be seen from Tokyo. The stately mountain is the subject of uncounted works of art - poems, songs, photographs, sculptures and paintings. Mount Fuji is a symbol of pride and beauty for all of Japan.
