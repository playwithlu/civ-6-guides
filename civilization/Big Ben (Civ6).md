# Big Ben (Civ6)

+3 {{Merchant6}} points per turn 
+1 {{EconomicPolicy6}} Economic policy slot 
Big Ben is an {{Link6|Industrial Era}} {{Link6|Wonder}} in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It must be built along a [River%20%28Civ6%29](River) adjacent to a [Commercial%20Hub%20%28Civ6%29](Commercial Hub) with a [Bank%20%28Civ6%29](Bank).
Strategy.
Big Ben is a very important wonder to build if you are focused on your economy. The added {{EconomicPolicy6}} [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](Economic Policy Card) slot and +6 {{Gold6}} per turn will help increase your empire's income, and the sudden influx of {{Gold6}} may give you the capital needed to patronize {{GreatPeople6}} (especially if you finish building this wonder when you have a large amount of {{Gold6}} in your treasury). Moreover, the extra {{Merchant6}} points will allow you to attract Great Merchants more quickly, many of whom will provide you with extra {{Amenities6}} and [Resource%20%28Civ6%29%23Luxury](luxury resources) from the time that Big Ben becomes available onward.
If you already have a strong {{Culture6}} generation, Big Ben might be a more worthwhile investment than the [Forbidden%20City%20%28Civ6%29](Forbidden City), because {{EconomicPolicy6}} Economic policy slots are almost on par with {{WildcardSlot6}} Wildcard slots in strength. This holds especially true when going for a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Domination](Domination Victory) and picking [Fascism%20%28Civ6%29](Fascism) as your Tier 3 [Government%20%28Civ6%29](government).
