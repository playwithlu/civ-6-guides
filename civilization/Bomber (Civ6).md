The Bomber doesn't become available until late in the game, but it completely changes the nature of sieges when it does. It can rain death on enemy [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) or pillage districts and tile improvements up to 10 [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles) away from its base, having nothing to fear except [Anti-Air%20Gun%20%28Civ6%29](Anti-Air Guns), [Mobile%20SAM%20%28Civ6%29](Mobile SAMs), patrolling fighters, a select few [Naval%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](naval units), and (in "Gathering Storm") [Giant%20Death%20Robot%20%28Civ6%29](Giant Death Robots). It can also deliver [Nuclear%20weapons%20%28Civ6%29](nuclear weapons), which will severely damage any [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](units) and destroy the defenses of any cities caught within the blast radius.
When delivering nuclear weapons, the attack will fail and the nuke will be lost if the Bomber falls below 50% [HP](HP) during an interception, so always make sure your Bomber is in good health and the anti-air defenses are cleared before delivering a nuclear payload.
