# Ludwig II (Civ6)

Ludwig II (25 August 1845 – 13 June 1886), sometimes called the Swan King, the Fairy Tale King, or the Mad King, was from 1864 until his death. He was known for his extravagant personality and deep fascination with art and architecture, commissioning multiple lavish palaces (most notably ) and being an avid patron of the great German composer . He leads the [German%20%28Civ6%29](Germans) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Bring wonder and beauty to an otherwise dull world with the Swan King, Ludwig II.
In-Game.
Ludwig's unique [Agenda%20%28Civ6%29](agenda) is Eternal Enigma. He likes [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) who do not maximize the number of {{District6}}s in their [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) and dislikes those who do.
His [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader ability) is Swan King. All [Wonder%20%28Civ6%29](wonders), finished or not, receive 2 {{Culture6}} from each adjacent {{District6}}, and all {{Culture6}} [Adjacency%20bonus%20%28Civ6%29](adjacency bonuses) generate {{Tourism6}} after researching [Castles%20%28Civ6%29](Castles).
Detailed Approach.
With Ludwig, build as many districts as a city can have, which, with Germany’s civilization ability is one more than everyone else. Then, place wonders all around your district - even if you do not finish them they will bring you {{Culture6}}. The [Hansa%20%28Civ6%29](Hansa) unique district will help their completion with its extra {{Production6}}. By the [Modern%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Modern Era), you have protection if any jealous rivals try to steal your wonders -- for then your [U-Boat%20%28Civ6%29](U-Boats), the swans of the modern era, will surely thwart their invasions. Unlocking Castles is the lynchpin in Ludwig’s pursuit for a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Culture Victory) with it providing {{Tourism6}} to every district that provides {{Culture6}} - including unfinished wonders.
