# Phasal Transporter (CivBE)

Strategy.
Using cutting-edge phasing technology, this amazing satellite is able to warp spacetime between 2 points and transport units instantly across vast distances. The tactical possibilities opened are enormous, ranging from instant movement of Workers and Colonists to newly established Outpost to strategical military unit redeployment. Of course, you need the relevant Orbital coverage around the position you're interested in. 
How it works in the game.
When you launch one of these, you choose what area in your territory to connect to, or an any area tile outside your territory that has firaxite. Areas will appear on the map you can link to, including areas blacked out you haven't explored yet. You can place one in an enemy's territory without realizing it, but won't be able to send any units there without an open borders agreement.
You can destroy any you aren't using to regain the petroleum and titanium.
Once any are placed, you can teleport to the locations they are aimed at, from any city you have.
