# Truffles (Civ6)/Civilopedia

A rare and expensive delicacy, truffles are the fruit of a family of fungi that grow underground. With a pungent aroma and powerful taste, truffles are used primarily for seasoning dishes in a variety of cuisines. But finding truffles is a laborious process. “Truffle pigs” were domesticated specifically for the purpose of finding truffles; with their uncanny sense of smell, these pigs are said to have been in use since the Roman Empire.
