# F1 (C-evo)

"[F1](F1)" is the function key that opens the [Manual](Manual) in the free-to-play game [C-evo](C-evo).
The initial display shows "chapter headings" but also has a "magnifying glass" icon that allows detailed searching of the text (not the headings, unfortunately - so you will not find "militia"!).
