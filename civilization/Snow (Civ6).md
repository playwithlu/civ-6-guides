# Snow (Civ6)

Snow is a base [Terrain%20%28Civ6%29](terrain), found only in polar regions (extreme north/south of the [Map%20%28Civ6%29](map), past [Tundra%20%28Civ6%29](Tundra)). It has no base yield, and usually no other uses.
Strategy.
Snow is by far the worst possible terrain to settle near. It provides no benefits at all - no [Woods%20%28Civ6%29](Woods) and only a few [Resource%20%28Civ6%29](resources) can be found there - though it may still have [Lake%20%28Civ6%29](Lakes) or coastlines. That said, some late-game strategic resources may be found in the Snow, sometimes making polar colonies worthwhile. Try to settle on Snow tiles only along the [Coast%20%28Civ6%29](Coast), or in close proximity with other terrain types - otherwise, any [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) founded there will have neither nor , and you will be forced to develop it via s only.
As a general rule, you should consider settling on a Snow tile only if you're playing as [Swedish%20%28Civ6%29](Sweden), trying to grab some rare that you don't already have in your empire, or planning to build the [Amundsen-Scott%20Research%20Station%20%28Civ6%29](Amundsen-Scott Research Station). Notably, many [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-states') unique [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](improvements) - such as the [Alc%C3%A1zar%20%28Civ6%29](Alc√°zar), [Trading%20Dome%20%28Civ6%29](Trading Dome), and [Mahavihara%20%28Civ6%29](Mahavihara) - can be built on Snow, so being the [Suzerain%20%28Civ6%29](Suzerain) of the city-states that unlock them will allow you to increase the yields of Snow tiles in your [Territory%20%28Civ6%29](territory).
