Strategy.
Like other impassable wonders, the Uluru tile offers no benefits, and cannot be developed or improved. However, Uluru provides +2 and +2 to up to six adjacent tiles; these yields are cumulatively worth considerably more than the dead tile. It is usually worth incorporating single-tile wonders within city borders to maximize their yields.
The Appeal bonus of Uluru (+4 to adjacent tiles, instead of the usual +2 from other natural wonders) is perfect for building [Neighborhood%20%28Civ6%29](Neighborhoods), and is useful when founding [National%20Park%20%28Civ6%29](National Parks).
Fittingly, the [Australian%20%28Civ6%29](Australians) will want to settle near Uluru if they find it in their game, as its high Appeal translates to high yield bonuses for their [District%20%28Civ6%29](districts).
