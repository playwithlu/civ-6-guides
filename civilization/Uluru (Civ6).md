# Uluru (Civ6)

Uluru is a single-tile impassable {{Link6|natural wonder}} available in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)" with the {{Link6|Australia Civilization &amp; Scenario Pack}}. Uluru occupies a {{Link6|Desert}} {{Link6|tile}}, and provides +2 {{Culture6}}, +2 {{Faith6}}, and +4 {{Link6|Appeal}} to each adjacent tile.
Despite its appearance and [Civilopedia](Civilopedia) description, Uluru is not considered a {{Link6|Mountain}} in-game.
In "", discovering Uluru grants +1 [Era%20Score%20%28Civ6%29](Era Score), or +3 Score if the player is the first to do so.
Strategy.
Like other impassable wonders, the Uluru tile offers no benefits, and cannot be developed or improved. However, Uluru provides +2 {{Culture6}} and +2 {{Faith6}} to up to six adjacent tiles; these yields are cumulatively worth considerably more than the dead tile. It is usually worth incorporating single-tile wonders within city borders to maximize their yields.
The Appeal bonus of Uluru (+4 to adjacent tiles, instead of the usual +2 from other natural wonders) is perfect for building [Neighborhood%20%28Civ6%29](Neighborhoods), and is useful when founding [National%20Park%20%28Civ6%29](National Parks).
Fittingly, the [Australian%20%28Civ6%29](Australians) will want to settle near Uluru if they find it in their game, as its high Appeal translates to high yield bonuses for their [District%20%28Civ6%29](districts).
