# Bomber Squadron (Civ4)/Final Frontier/Civilopedia

When more powerful weapons became smaller, a new spacecraft philosophy emerged: create a weapons platform as small, fast and inexpensive as possible but still capable of delivering a deadly payload. The ion torpedo proved the perfect armament and the first Space Bombers were created. The Space Bomber is a small spacecraft, similar in design and utility to the aircraft which had seen use on Earth for centuries. Being smaller in size and having weaker weapons makes individual Bombers limited in effectiveness, but when used en masse they can be shockingly efficient. To respond to the growing threat from smaller craft, Destroyers have been retooled to include weapons designed to protect themselves and other ships from these versatile spacecraft.
