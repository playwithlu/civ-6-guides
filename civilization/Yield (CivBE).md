# Yield (CivBE)

A yield is one of the main statistics used to assess the status of your [List%20of%20sponsors%20in%20CivBE](faction). Each yield serves a purpose, enabling your [Colony%20%28CivBE%29](colony) to grow, construct, maintain, develop, and expand itself across the [Planet%20%28CivBE%29](planet).
Most elements of your colony will generate or consume one of several yields. They are produced by [City%20%28CivBE%29](cities), typically by assigning {{PopulationBE}} to work the [Terrain%20%28CivBE%29](tile) around it, or from [Building%20%28CivBE%29](buildings) within them.
