Great Library entry.
The Bronze Age king of Crete was the legendary Minos, the priest-king whose palaces of Knossos and Phaestos date from about 2000 BC. Legend has it that this was the home of the Minotaur, the man-eating, half-bull of the maze. Some have speculated that the Labyrinth was regarded as an ancient day "Disneyland" of sorts, leading to increased tourism and ultimately, increased trade with the Minoans.
