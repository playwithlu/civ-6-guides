# Flood Plains (Civ5)

Flood Plains are a type of [Terrain%20%28Civ5%29%23Terrain%20Features](terrain feature) in "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)".
Game Info.
Terrain feature found on flat [Desert%20%28Civ5%29](Desert) tiles which are adjacent to [Rivers%20%28Civ5%29](Rivers).
Strategy.
Flood Plains greatly benefit [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilizations) that start near large deserts, as they allow normal development in an otherwise harsh and inhospitable environment. Try to settle your [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities) near Rivers to use the Flood Plains for .
Using an [Atomic%20Bomb%20%28Civ5%29](Atomic Bomb) or a [Nuclear%20Missile%20%28Civ5%29](Nuclear Missile) on Flood Plains tiles will remove them. This is particularly useful when facing the [Dutch%20%28Civ5%29](Dutch) (who can construct [Polder%20%28Civ5%29](Polders) there) or the [Arabian%20%28Civ5%29](Arabians) and the [Moroccan%20%28Civ5%29](Moroccans) (who tend to get most of their from Flood Plains).
