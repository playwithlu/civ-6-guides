Intro.
The destruction of a continent
Since the time of the Greek philosopher [Plato](Plato), 2500 years ago, people have been intrigued by his tragic narrative of the destruction of Atlantis and its technologically advanced society. Did the city actually disappear beneath the waves in a volcanic cataclysm, or did it spring entirely from Plato's fertile imagination to be made the subject of a morality tale?

Perhaps you can transform her story from tragedy into triumph!
