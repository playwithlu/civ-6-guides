Civilopedia entry.
In the eternal vastness of space, a single Missile or lone Bomber can be as difficult to spot as a needle in a lightless haystack. Probing the skies with an ever-watchful digital eye, the Squadron Defense Network is a Star System's most reliable defense against surprise attack. A highly sophisticated network of system-wide sensors monitored by highly-sophisticated computers, the Squadron Defense Network is able to track thousands of targets and assess their threat level on the fly. Yet the sheer amount of traffic on even a mid-sized shipping world makes the Squadron Defense Network a less than perfect aegis against incoming threats.
