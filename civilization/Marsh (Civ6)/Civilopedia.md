# Marsh (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Covered with herbaceous rather than woody plants, these freshwater wetlands are generally found along slow-flowing rivers or on the banks of lakes. Home to an incredible variety of valuable things, plant and animal, in some civilizations, towns in marshes and swamps grew into great cities: St. Petersburg, New Orleans, and the Brazilian ones in the Pantanal.
