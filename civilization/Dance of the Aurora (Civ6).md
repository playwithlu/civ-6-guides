# Dance of the Aurora (Civ6)

Dance of the Aurora is a [Pantheon%20%28Civ6%29](Pantheon) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It increases the output of [Holy%20Site%20%28Civ6%29](Holy Site) [District%20%28Civ6%29](districts) by 1 for each adjacent [Tundra%20%28Civ6%29](Tundra) [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tile).
Strategy.
Like all pantheons that rely on specific [Terrain%20%28Civ6%29](terrain) types, Dance of the Aurora attempts to boost the desirability of an otherwise unappealing terrain. It requires an appropriate start and the player having more interest in than whatever other bonuses may be obtained (e.g., extra by taking [Goddess%20of%20the%20Hunt%20%28Civ6%29](Goddess of the Hunt) and improving and with [Camp%20%28Civ6%29](Camps)).
If a [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) can make any use of extra , however, a pantheon that specializes in generating absurd amounts of such as this one is certainly a good choice. Combining this pantheon's benefits with those of [Peter%20%28Civ6%29](Peter) in particular will result in a "lot" of , due to [Russian%20%28Civ6%29](Russia's) [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](civilization ability) of obtaining extra and from Tundra tiles. This can then be invested in religious wars, the recruitment of , or - after adopting [Theocracy%20%28Civ6%29](Theocracy) or building the [Grand%20Master%27s%20Chapel%20%28Civ6%29](Grand Master's Chapel) - the purchase of [Military%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](military units). [Wilfrid%20Laurier%20%28Civ6%29](Wilfrid Laurier) (another [Leaders%20%28Civ6%29](leader) with a Tundra [Starting%20bias%20%28Civ6%29](starting bias)) can also potentially make good use of this pantheon, although is not a particularly strong suit of his.
Another side-effect of the pantheon to keep in mind is that almost all your Holy Sites built in Tundra will trigger a "Splendid Holy Site Completed" [Historic%20Moments%20%28Civ6%29](Historic Moment) upon completion, which gives you +3 Era Score for the first time you achieve this.
