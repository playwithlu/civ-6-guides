# Population (CivRev)

Population is a measure of the number of citizens living in a [City%20%28CivRev%29](city) in "[Civilization%20Revolution](Civilization Revolution)". Cities with a large population can support a larger workforce and will therefore be more productive than cities with a small population.
The maximum population for a city is 31. Training [Settlers%20%28CivRev%29](Settlers) in a city reduces its population by 2 (or 1 if you've selected [Republic%20%28CivRev%29](Republic) as your [Government%20%28CivRev%29](government)). These Settlers can then be used to found a new city, or sent to an existing city to increase its population.
Growth.
Population growth is a mechanic that affects all your settlements. Your settlement's population will grow faster depending on how many [Food%20%28CivRev%29](Food) [Tile%20%28CivRev%29](tiles) you are farming. As your population grows, you will have more workers to farm [List%20of%20resources%20in%20CivRev](Resources).
Building the [Hanging%20Gardens%20of%20Babylon%20%28CivRev%29](Hanging Gardens of Babylon) in a city will instantly increase its population by 50% (rounded up, but never exceeding the maximum of 31).
