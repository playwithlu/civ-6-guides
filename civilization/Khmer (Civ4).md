# Khmer (Civ4)

The Khmer people represent a [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ4](civilization) in "[Civilization%20IV](Civilization IV)".
Strategy.
The Khmer Empire, under the command of [Suryavarman%20II%20%28Civ4%29](Suryavarman II), is a [City%20%28Civ4%29](city)-building civilization. Not only does the [Baray%20%28Civ4%29](Baray), the Khmer's [Unique%20building%20%28Civ4%29](unique building), provide the health benefits of an [Aqueduct%20%28Civ4%29](Aqueduct), but it also provides an extra food, boosting the growth of cities in which it is built. Suryavarman's "[Expansive%20%28Civ4%29](Expansive)" [Leader%20trait%20%28Civ4%29](trait) will quickly expand the population of these blossoming cities, while his "[Creative%20%28Civ4%29](Creative)" trait will give the security of ever-expanding [Borders%20%28Civ4%29](borders). Finally, the [Ballista%20Elephant%20%28Civ4%29](Ballista Elephant), with its high strength and massive bonuses against mounted units, will make any foe think twice before trying to take one of your stunning Khmer metropolises. He can be a little aggressive if you train some military units in cities that have more health, happiness and production.
