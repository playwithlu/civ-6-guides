# Geophysics (CivBE)

Game Information.
Geophysics is a Tier 1 [Secondary%20Tech%20%28CivBE%29](Secondary Tech) that can be researched from [Ecology%20%28CivBE%29](Ecology). It reveals [Geothermal%20%28CivBE%29](Geothermal resources), and allows tapping them with the [Geothermal%20Well%20%28CivBE%29](Geothermal well).
In Universe information.
Geophysics, or physics applied specifically to a planet's crust, was actually applied to this planet even before planetfall of the first colonists. It was, of course, critical for our survival to know the tectonic and volcanic activity of the planet, gravitational and magnetic fields, hydrologic dynamics, rock formation and a myriad other details. 
But more in-depth research was only possible after the first colonies were established and scientists were able to carve deep into the planet's crust to position tectonic scanners for prolonged periods of time. This finally revealed minute details about geological activity and previously unknown qualities of the lower levels of the crust, which in turn helped the discovery of one of the more interesting resources on the planet - Geothermal.
