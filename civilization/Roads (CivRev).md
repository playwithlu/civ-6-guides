# Roads (CivRev)

By constructing roads between [City%20%28CivRev%29](cities) you can move any [List%20of%20units%20in%20CivRev](unit) any distance along it for only a single action point. Note that "any" [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20CivRev](civilization) can use roads, not just the creator, so be careful about roads near your opponents because they can use them to attack you as well.
The materials from which roads are made change as you advance through the [Era%20%28CivRev%29](eras).
