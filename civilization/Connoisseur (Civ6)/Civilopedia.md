# Connoisseur (Civ6)/Civilopedia

A connoisseur is someone who appreciates subtle grades and differences in the quality of an item, such as food, wine, or art. The ability to discern and articulate quality of delights is praiseworthy in hedonic philosophies like Epicureanism. Grumpy naysayers and the uneducated are more likely to lampoon the connoisseurâ€™s habits and exquisite tastes. How boorish!
