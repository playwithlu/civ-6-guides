Great Library entry.
Tyranny was, in many ways, the oldest form of government. Tyrants derived their power from nothing more than their ability to physically enforce it. The tyrant was obligated to his or her subjects for the protection, stewardship and welfare of the people. Tyranny was always one of the most tenuous forms of government. Since its basis of power was so easily shaken, tyrants generally did not last long. They could rarely extract any fealty from their subjects, as they often stayed in charge merely for the lack of sufficient forces to overthrow them. Furthermore, because tyranny relied on the size and power of the military or police force, larger empires became unmanageable and were subject to revolution.
