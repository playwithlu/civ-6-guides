# Sphinx (Civ6)

The Sphinx is a unique of the [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It can be built on any land , including .
Strategy.
The Sphinx has some of the least restrictive placement requirements of any improvement - any passable land tile is fair game, except for [Snow%20%28Civ6%29](Snow) and [Snow%20%28Hills%29%20%28Civ6%29](Snow Hills) in "". The Egyptians should build them on tiles that cannot support other improvements, or adjacent to [Wonder%20%28Civ6%29](wonders) for some extra . Thanks to their Appeal bonus, well-placed Sphinxes can create good spots for [Seaside%20Resort%20%28Civ6%29](Seaside Resorts) and [National%20Park%20%28Civ6%29](National Parks), or increase the yields of those that are already there.
Under the "Gathering Storm" ruleset, the Sphinx's Appeal bonus increases from +1 to +2. This is equivalent to the bonuses from any [Natural%20wonder%20%28Civ6%29](natural wonder) other than [Uluru%20%28Civ6%29](Uluru) or the [Eiffel%20Tower%20%28Civ6%29](Eiffel Tower), a [Modern%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Modern Era) wonder, and it can be built almost anywhere in your empire! Appeal bonuses stack, so a tile adjacent to two Sphinxes will receive +4 Appeal, and Appeal tends to be underrated by players because it can't be seen on the [Map%20%28Civ6%29](map) without its special [Lens%20%28Civ6%29](lens). Therefore, the best [Pantheon%20%28Civ6%29](pantheon) for Egypt under this ruleset is [Earth%20Goddess%20%28Civ6%29](Earth Goddess), since the Sphinx makes it easier than ever to get Breathtaking tiles everywhere. Earth Goddess will generate a huge amount of early on as well as into the mid- and late game, helping you with any [Victory%20%28Civ6%29](victory) type you choose.
