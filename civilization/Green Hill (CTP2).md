# Green Hill (CTP2)

Green Hills are a type of [Terrain%20%28CTP2%29](terrain) in "[Call%20to%20Power%20II](Call to Power II)". [Coffee%20%28CTP2%29](Coffee) and [Grapes%20%28CTP2%29](Grapes) can be found here.
Gameplay.
Hills are good places to build {{LinkCTP2|Cities}}, because they give a {{LinkCTP2|Defensive}} bonus to any units stationed there. The {{LinkCTP2|Production}} and {{LinkCTP2|Commerce}} bonuses are substantial, but {{LinkCTP2|Food}} is minimal. One can build {{LinkCTP2|Roads}}, {{LinkCTP2|Mines}} and {{LinkCTP2|Trading Posts}}, but not {{LinkCTP2|Farms}}.
One needs to discover {{LinkCTP2|Explosives}} to {{LinkCTP2|Terraform}} Hills.
