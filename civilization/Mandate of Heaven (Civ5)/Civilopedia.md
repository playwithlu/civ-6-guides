# Mandate of Heaven (Civ5)/Civilopedia

The mandate of heaven policy says that the current rulers of a country are in power because "Heaven" (or the gods) put them there and support them. Dissent against the rulers is not only treasonous, it's also sinful. Such systems greatly promote support for the rulers, but they are not without risk. If the country suffers a natural disaster - famine, flood, earthquake, hurricane, rain of frogs, or whatever - that may be seen as a sign that Heaven is displeased with the leaders and has removed its "mandate" from them. This gives the citizens the right to overthrow the sinful rulers and replace them with ones more to Heaven's liking.
