# Orbital Engineering (Civ4)/Final Frontier/Civilopedia

While PDE scientist Jing Shen designed the first systems that would take humanity outside its solar system, it was the first Orbital Engineering Societies - organizations created in the Colonies following the fateful year of 2302 AD - that discovered methods to make exploring space a sustainable endeavor. The first Starbase, a massive space station capable of acting as a factory, barracks and hospital, was the direct creation of these early Orbital Engineers. New, space-guarded Anti-Ship Missiles likewise saw increased usage from this movement. Yet the most lasting effect of the rise of Orbital Engineering had to be the change in perspective of space, changing from an empty and hostile land to a world of endless opportunities.
