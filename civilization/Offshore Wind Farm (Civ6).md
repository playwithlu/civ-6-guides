# Offshore Wind Farm (Civ6)

The Offshore Wind Farm is a standard [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](tile improvement) in "". It is used to supply [Power%20%28Civ6%29](Power) to the city from water tiles. It must be built on a [Coast%20%28Civ6%29](Coast) or [Lake%20%28Civ6%29](Lake) [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tile).
Strategy.
The Offshore Wind Farm is a very helpful tile improvement as it allows you to make use of water tiles that otherwise would have been unable to be improved. As a bonus, it frees up other land tiles that you may have needed to use for [Solar%20Farm%20%28Civ6%29](Solar Farms) or onshore [Wind%20Farm%20%28Civ6%29](Wind Farms) to construct other improvements instead (which can't go into the water), such as [Farm%20%28Civ6%29](Farms), and s.
This improvement is available around the same time as the [Seastead%20%28Civ6%29](Seastead), which provides , , , and . Because of this, you should only build just enough Offshore Wind Farms to supply to the city and prioritize Seasteads on other water tiles due to the Seasteads' superiority in terms of yields. Since Seasteads cannot be built adjacent to each other, one potential strategy is to build Offshore Wind Farms in between Seasteads, so as to maximize the potential yields.
