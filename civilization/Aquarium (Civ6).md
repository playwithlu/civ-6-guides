# Aquarium (Civ6)

The Aquarium is an advanced [Amenities%20%28Civ6%29%23Entertainment](entertainment) [Building%20%28Civ6%29](building) in "". It is built in the [Water%20Park%20%28Civ6%29](Water Park) [District%20%28Civ6%29](district) and requires a [Ferris%20Wheel%20%28Civ6%29](Ferris Wheel) (or one of its replacements).
Strategy.
The Aquarium provides an extra to all cities within nine tiles of its district, as well as extra from Reefs, s, and water-based resources within its city's territory. If you build it in a -focused city, be sure not to let any [Archaeologist%20%28Civ6%29](Archaeologists) excavate nearby s (unless you have no other way to get an Artifact you desperately need).
