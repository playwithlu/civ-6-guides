Masonry primarily involves the science and technique of bricklaying. Bricks of stone, clay and marble provided the ability to build over varying kinds of terrain. The {{LinkCTP2|Aqueduct}} {{LinkCTP2|city improvement}} transports water over great distances.
The {{LinkCTP2|Great Wall}} is also a testament to the permanence and resiliency of Masonry.
Great Library entry.
Some societies, such as the Egyptians, standardized masonry techniques as early as 4000 BC. Masonry is divided into two broad categories called rubble and ashlar. Rubble involves irregular and coarsely jointed quarried and field stones. Ashlar, by contrast, is made up of cut stones set with fine, close joints. Some cultures opted to use mortar and other adhesives, but others used "dry masonry."
The limitations of geography and whatever geological conditions prevailed have affected access to masonry materials. Sandstone, limestone, alabaster, granite and basalt dominate Egyptian architecture as sun-dried and kiln-glazed clay bricks are found in Persian and Assyrian structures. Masonry became a crucial skill for ancient peoples, and its mastery has enabled civilizations to solve many problems of resource access, national security and city expansion.
The Romans made extensive use of masonry, adapting their methods to the idiosyncrasies of each geographic area they ruled. Perhaps the most famous Roman masonry achievement was their aqueduct system. Stretching for hundreds of miles, from Gaul to Asia Minor, aqueducts provided Roman citizens and subjects with fresh water for public baths, toilets, and fountains.
Built in the 3rd century BC, the Great Wall of China is one of the wonders of the world. Winding along 1,500 miles of Northern China from the Gansu province to the Hebei province, it was designed to protect China from northern nomads and invaders. Almost all of it is earth and stone faced with brick, an example of the permanency and durability of masonry.
