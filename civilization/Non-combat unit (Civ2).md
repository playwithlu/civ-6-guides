# Non-combat unit (Civ2)

Non-combat units are {{Link|2|unit}}s with an Attack strength of 0. Such units cannot initiate {{Link|2|combat}} or capture {{Link|2|City|cities}}, though they can still be used to defend. Non-combat units are uniquely vulnerable to {{Link|2|Partisans}}, which gain an eightfold attack bonus when engaging them. They do not provoke {{Link|2|war weariness}} when fielded outside of cities.
Modding.
A unit is automatically registered as a non-combatant if its {{Link|2|Modding|sub=Units|sec=Statistics|Attack strength}} is 0. The popup prompted when the player attempts to use a non-combat unit to attack is defined at {{mono|@NONCOMBAT}} in {{Link|2|Modding|sub=Popups|Game.txt}}.
