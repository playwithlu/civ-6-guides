# Corporate Libertarianism (Civ6)

Corporate Libertarianism is a form of Tier 4 [Government%20%28Civ6%29](government) in "". It is unlocked by the [Venture%20Politics%20%28Civ6%29](Venture Politics) [Civics%20%28Civ6%29](civic).
Strategy.
Corporate Libertarianism is the best of the Tier 4 governments for warmongers, providing three slots for [Policy%20Cards%20%28Civ6%29](Military Policy Cards) and bonuses to and [Resources%20%28Civ6%29](resource) extraction that make it easier to raise and support a large military. Contrary to what this government's name and background suggest, it has only one Economic Policy Card slot, though the five Wildcard slots largely make up for this.
Conversely for those who are not warmongers, it's arguably also flexible enough to be able to form the basis of a good bulwark against warmongers with designs on your empire, while not necessarily totally derailing whatever non-aggressive [Victory%20%28Civ6%29](victory) path you were on when you were forced to rapidly militarize.
