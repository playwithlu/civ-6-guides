# Unit (Civ5)

A unit in "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)" is a mobile entity which can move around the map and perform certain functions. Most units in the game are military (combat) units - they have the ability to attack and damage other units and [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities). Those that can't do that are also known as civilian units.
Units are the "mobile" part of your empire, just as cities are its "stationary" part. Civilian units are essential to its economy, while military units ensure its safety and allow you to attack and defeat other empires.
Types of Units.
There are several types of military units, which are often referred to in other articles:
Producing Units.
There are several ways to get units:
In some cases, you will also need [Resources%20%28Civ5%29%23Strategic%20Resources](strategic resources) for your units. Any resources needed are deducted from the total at the beginning of the cycle for the relevant unit, or at the moment of its purchase. If you have no available counts of the needed resource, you won't able to build or purchase this unit! You should also note that if you had produced a unit which needs a particular strategic resource, and later lose access to this resource so that its count drops to negative values, this unit (and all that need this resource) will fight with a -50% Combat Strength penalty until you rectify the situation!
Unit Supply and Maintenance.
Each empire can only support so many units - this depends on the number of cities and Population per city. Also, once produced, each unit costs to maintain, with the cost going up in successive eras for more advanced units. In fact, unit maintenance is one of the two big stones weighing down your empire's treasury (the other one being building maintenance). Maintaining a large army can be quite a financial challenge, especially in the late game, so think carefully about whether or not you need all those Workers and [Inquisitor%20%28Civ5%29](Inquisitors) lying around doing nothing.
Note that if your output becomes negative and your treasury empties, your units may start disbanding (vanishing) on their own! So, if you don't want to lose the army you've trained and honed so carefully, take care to have enough at all times!
Unit Statistics and Abilities.
All civilian units have certain special abilities. Some of them are inherent to the unit, such as the "Found City" ability of the Settler; others (most of the abilities of the Worker) are unlocked via technological advancement.
Military units have a number of statistics which control their core performance and abilities in combat (you can check them [Combat%20%28Civ5%29%23Unit%20Combat%20Statistics](here)). They also may have special abilities, although these are quite focused and with limited use (such as bonuses against certain unit types). However, all military units may also gain promotions by gathering combat experience and advancing in levels. These promotions may give them special abilities which make them really fearsome in combat. For a list of promotions, check [Promotions%20%28Civ5%29](here), and for the mechanics of gaining experience and leveling up, check [Experience%20%28Civ5%29](here).
Unit Upgrading.
This refers solely to military units, and means the process of replacing outdated weaponry and machines with more modern ones. You will notice that despite the huge number of units available in the game, most of them actually fall into several distinct types (see above), which simply change weapons and equipment (and tactical formations) during the ages. This change is known as unit upgrading, and may be done only after you research certain key technologies (developing the new, more advanced unit, and allowing the upgrade). The unit needs to be "inside" your territory (no, Allied territory is not applicable in this case!), and you'll need to spend some on the upgrade.

Notes.
Air units may only be upgraded while in cities - carriers can't support the high-tech engineering needed for the upgrades. The unit loses all its remaining Movement Points for the turn of the upgrade, and is ready to go the next turn. Also, if the unit was wounded, it will continue at its present Health even if it did not move at all on the turn of the upgrade.
Maybe the greatest advantage of upgrading units is that they retain all their promotions, and even some of their inherent special abilities. Core abilities like extra strength or mobility are usually lost, while "special" abilities and promotions like "Great Generals" or "Extra Range" are retained. So, for example, when you upgrade an [Aztec%20%28Civ5%29](Aztec) [Jaguar%20%28Civ5%29](Jaguar) to a next-gen [Swordsman%20%28Civ5%29](Swordsman), the new Swordsman will not only retain all promotions the Jaguar had earned during its existence, but it will also retain the Jaguar's Woodsman abilities! Note that some civilizations' unique units come with free "regular" promotion (such as Drill I or Siege I). These units are spawned with these promotions, or acquire them automatically upon upgrading from previous units. You should be aware of that and plan not to waste experience for a promotion you are about to get for free later!
It is not possible to "skip" upgrades: for instance, in "Brave New World", to upgrade a [Swordsman%20%28Civ5%29](Swordsman) to a [Musketman%20%28Civ5%29](Musketman), the Swordsman must first be upgraded to a [Longswordsman%20%28Civ5%29](Longswordsman).
Upgrading existing units is much more advantageous than producing new ones, not only because of previously earned abilities that are retained, but also because you save the time for building the new units in your cities. Of course, you'll need to ensure you have enough for the upgrade, as well as any strategic resources needed.
Some common upgrade costs on standard speed include:
Warrior -&gt; Swordsmen (80 gold)
Spearmen -&gt; Pikemen (75? gold)
Archer -&gt; Composite Bow (80? gold)
Composite Bow -&gt; Crossbowman (100 gold)
Chariot Archer -&gt; Knight (130? gold)
Horsemen -&gt; Knight (90? gold)
