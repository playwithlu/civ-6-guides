# Superconductor (CTP1)

Superconductor is an advance in "".
Summary.
The Superconductor, third Electrical Advance, breaks the limitation of distance and of time by creating conductors that transmit current without any energy loss. Used to create super-magnets, Superconductors allow for the creation of the Rail Launcher which flings cargo into space on a magnetic charge and the Maglev allowing for super fast transportation on land.
Great Library entry.
The Computer proved critical in research by allowing scientists to model atomic behavior. Material research experienced a rash of breakthroughs as a result, one of which led eventually to Superconductors. Scientists discovered the first superconductors in the second decade of the 20th century. These, however, worked only at a few degrees above absolute zero. Nearly a century later, work on ceramic insulators resulted in the freak discovery of the world's first high temperature superconductor, but another full century passed before the first room temperature superconductor came online.
