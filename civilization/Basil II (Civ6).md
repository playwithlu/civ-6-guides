# Basil II (Civ6)

Basil II (c. 958 – 15 December 1025), nicknamed the Bulgar-Slayer for his of the , was the senior from 976 to his death. His 49-year reign, the longest of any Byzantine emperor, is considered the pinnacle of Byzantine power during the Middle Ages. He leads the [Byzantine%20%28Civ6%29](Byzantines) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Byzantium combines religious and military tactics towards a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Domination](Domination) or [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Religion](Religious Victory).
Intro.
 Your enemies will fear you, King Basil II, for you were forged in the fire. Let your cunning and ambitions sharpen your blade. Protect your pride and stand against your foes, both within your walls and beyond.
In-Game.
Basil II's unique [Agenda%20%28Civ6%29](agenda) is Divine Guardian. He will focus on spreading his [Religion%20%28Civ6%29](religion), likes those who follow his religion, and dislikes those who follow a different religion.
His [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader ability) is Porphyrogénnētos. His [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Heavy%20cavalry](heavy) and [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Light%20cavalry](light cavalry units) deal full damage when attacking [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) following the same religion as Byzantium. It also gives him access to the [Tagma%20%28Civ6%29](Tagma) once he researches [Divine%20Right%20%28Civ6%29](Divine Right).
Detailed Approach.
The first priority for the Byzantines is to found a religion, and spread it, as victories in the religious realm lead to increased military strength (and vice-versa). Their unique Taxis ability gives them additional Combat and Religious Strength for every [Holy%20City%20%28Civ6%29](Holy City) converted, and the Byzantine founded religion spreads when defeating opposing [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](units). Further, if you manage to convert your rival's cities to your religion, Basil's unique ability allows melee attacks to do full damage against them. In addition to these, the Tagma [Unique%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](unique unit) gives additional strength to any religious or military unit adjacent to it. Fueling these armies are bonus Heavy Cavalry (e.g. Tagma) from the Byzantine unique [District%20%28Civ6%29](district), the [Hippodrome%20%28Civ6%29](Hippodrome), and an early-[Era%20%28Civ6%29](era) [Naval%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](naval unit), the [Dromon%20%28Civ6%29](Dromon), with increased damage against units and increased range. With this synergy between religion and military, Byzantium is setup to win either a Religious or Domination Victory.
