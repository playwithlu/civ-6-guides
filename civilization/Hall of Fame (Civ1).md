# Hall of Fame (Civ1)

The Hall of Fame in "[Sid%20Meier%27s%20Civilization](Sid Meier's Civilization)" is a listing of the best games since you last retired or completed a game. It is a separate file, which can be copied to a separate folder with the saves for any particular game, so that you can start a new Hall or at least continue modifying one while preserving an earlier listing. You can fill a whole Hall during one game by retiring (which chalks up a result if it qualifies) then resuming from your last save.
You see the top five (with your current effort at the bottom if you didn't make the top five). The order depends on your Civilization Rating, a percentage of something. Criteria that determine your Rating are not entirely obvious. Your "points" (which are fairly transparent, based on population, years of peace, wonders, and pollution, and can be checked easily earlier in the game) count, but so do the [Difficulty%20level%20%28Civ1%29](difficulty level) (apparently the dominant factor) and possibly the number of turns.
Just before the Hall is displayed, you see a screen that compares you with other historic personages. It goes a bit like this:
