# Submarine (Civ3)

Submarines can operate invisibly to enemy units because they travel beneath the waves. They remain invisible until they
attack a surface ship, after which they again disappear. However, other submarines and [AEGIS%20Cruiser%20%28Civ3%29](AEGIS Cruisers) can see them plainly.
A coastal city needs oil in its Strategic Resource box to build a sub.
