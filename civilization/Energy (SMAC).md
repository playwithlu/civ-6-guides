The following [Landmarks%20%28SMAC%29](Landmarks): [Uranium%20Flats%20%28SMAC%29](Uranium Flats), [Geothermal%20Shallows%20%28SMAC%29](Geothermal Shallows), [Pholus%20Ridge%20%28SMAC%29](Pholus Ridge), [Mount%20Planet%20%28SMAC%29](Mount Planet) provides an extra +1 Energy on their respective squares.
[Xenofungus%20%28SMAC%29](Xenofungus) provides +1 Energy with the discovery of [Centauri%20Meditation%20%28SMAC%29](Centauri Meditation), +1 with [Secrets%20of%20Alpha%20Centauri%20%28SMAC%29](Secrets of Alpha Centauri), 1+ with [Temporal%20Mechanics%20%28SMAC%29](Temporal Mechanics).
Stockpile Energy.
If you don't particularly need any new units or facilities from a base, but don't want to let its production capacity go to waste (or if your faction is strapped for cash) you can order your base to Stockpile Energy. This causes the base to immediately sell off every excess mineral it produces in exchange for energy credits, which are then deposited in your energy reserves. (Every 2 excess minerals you produce turn into 1 energy).
