# Starting a new game (CivBE)

&lt;br&gt;
"" fundamentally changes the way you define your [Civilizations](civilization) (or more specifically, [Colony%20%28CivBE%29](colony)). Instead of selecting from a list of preset civilizations with [Unique%20ability](defined special abilities) and [unit](unit)s, you can now customize to a much higher degree by selecting a series of details which will define the features of the expedition that was sent to colonize the alien planet you will land on. You must choose your [Sponsors%20%28CivBE%29](sponsor), [Colonists%20%28CivBE%29](colonists), [Spacecraft%20%28CivBE%29](spacecraft), and [Cargo%20%28CivBE%29](cargo). These selections define the initial status of your civilization. Finally, you'll choose the [Planet%20%28CivBE%29](map/planet) type, as the ultimate component to setting up your very own expedition to an alien planet.
Colonists.
After choosing your sponsor you get to decide what kind of colonists were put into the spaceship. Colonists provide a strong backbone for populating all colonial centers, and depending on their type bring another strong, city-based bonus, also useful throughout the game.
Spacecraft.
When you have picked your colonists, it's time to select the special feature of your spaceship. This bonus is oriented towards the early stages of the game, as it is related to the colonization ship (which probably is dismantled to provide materials for the first city). Thus the advantage quickly becomes obsolete.
Cargo.
Next you must select your spaceship's cargo. These additional materials define what you have with you right away when you found your first city, and consists of a free building or unit.
Planet.
Finally you choose the planet you are going to colonize. The planets have different names, but their main features are always the same:

Advanced Setup options.
Naming your Civilization.
Players can name their civilization and their leader something other than what the name given to by default. Note, that the bonuses provided by the civilization the player choose are not changed, nor is the color scheme changed. To do this players must use [Mods%20%28CivBE%29](mods). Players can change:
Teams.
Players may team up with several AI players should they choose to.
More planet options.
Planet Biome
World Age
Older worlds are more eroded and contain fewer hills and mountains, while younger worlds have much rougher terrain
Temperature
Rainfall
Victory Types.
The player can disable certain victory conditions should they choose to.
