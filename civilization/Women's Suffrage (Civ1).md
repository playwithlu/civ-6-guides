Civilopedia entry.
After many years of struggle, women in the United States won the right to vote in 1920 with the passage of the 19th amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The achievement of Women's Suffrage was accelerated by the excellent record of women in traditional male jobs during World War I. Full voting rights were given to women in Great Britain in 1928. Since then women have gained this right in most of the developed world.
