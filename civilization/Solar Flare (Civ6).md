# Solar Flare (Civ6)

A Solar Flare is a type of [Disasters%20%28Civ6%29](natural disaster) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)", unique to the [Apocalypse%20%28Civ6%29](Apocalypse) [Game%20Mode%20%28Civ6%29](game mode). It can trigger at any point of the game but very rarely; however, when the [Climate%20%28Civ6%29%23Phases%20of%20Climate%20Change](Climate Change) reaches Phase VII, the world will enter the Apocalypse phase, and Solar Flares will start showing up often. Although they are not as frequent and destructive as [Comet%20Strike%20%28Civ6%29](Comet Strikes), Solar Flares greatly hinder all [Victory%20%28Civ6%29](victory) conditions, especially Scientific Victory, by effectively shutting down the network everywhere. It is the only natural disaster that happens on a global scale.
