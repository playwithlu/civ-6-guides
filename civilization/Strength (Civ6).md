# Strength (Civ6)

Strength is a rough measurement of the fighting prowess of a [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](unit) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". There are five different types of Strength, which can be modified by factors such as [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](policy cards), [Promotion%20%28Civ6%29](promotions), and [Terrain%20%28Civ6%29](terrain):
Strength should not be confused with [hit%20points](hit points) (HP), which determine how much damage a unit can sustain before dying.
