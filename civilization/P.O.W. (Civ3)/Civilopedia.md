# P.O.W. (Civ3)/Civilopedia

During WWII the Axis powers, especially, were notorious for forcing captured personnel to assist their war
effort -- working in factories, and building fortifications or other structures, such as bridges. The P.O.W.
unit appears in place of a captured worker. Even if later "liberated", however, the P.O.W. tag will aptly
stick with the unit, identifying it as a former prisoner.
