# Phalanx (Civ4)

The Phalanx is the [Unique%20unit%20%28Civ4%29](unique unit) of the [Greek%20%28Civ4%29](Greek) [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ4](civilization). In [vanilla](vanilla) "[Civilization%20IV](Civilization IV)", the Phalanx replaces the [Spearman%20%28Civ4%29](Spearman), while in "" it replaces the [Axeman%20%28Civ4%29](Axeman).
Strategy (Vanilla).
Compared to the Spearman, the Phalanx gets +1 strength and receives +25% defense in [Hill%20%28Civ4%29](hills).
Using Phalanxes.
Phalanxes are the ultimate anti-horse unit for quite a long time. Stack them with [Axeman%20%28Civ4%29](Axemen) and you can effectively attack cities - with both units. Be sure to leave at least one Axeman and Phalanx undamaged per stack to prevent retaliation.
Against Phalanxes.
Axemen are still effective against Phalanxes, and you can take down a stack of them fairly easily. If they're using Axemen themselves, bring [Chariot%20%28Civ4%29](Chariots) as well.
Strategy (BtS).
Compared to the Axeman, the Phalanx gets +100% defense vs. [Chariot%20%28Civ4%29](Chariots).
Using Phalanxes.
The defensive bonus covers the usual weakness of [Axeman%20%28Civ4%29](Axemen), allowing them to potentially raid cities with just a single-unit stack. Give them [Shock%20%28Civ4%29](Shock) promotions, or take some Chariots to have the upper hand against other Axemen, or City Attack promotions to capitalize on the city-attack-ability.
Against Phalanxes.
Axemen will be an even match against Phalanxes, but a Shock promotion will give those Axeman the upper hand - unless they're using it themselves. Try to force them onto bad terrain if they're attacking you - cover the hills with [Archer%20%28Civ4%29](Archers).
