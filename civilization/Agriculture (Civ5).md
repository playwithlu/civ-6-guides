# Agriculture (Civ5)

Game Info.
The basis of all civilized life, Agriculture allows working the land for food. This, in turn, makes possible the whole concept of a group of humans establishing themselves in one permanent location and thriving there, instead of living as hunter-gatherers and constantly moving about in search of food. It allows [Worker%20%28Civ5%29](Workers) to construct [Farm%20%28Civ5%29](Farms), which are vital for increasing the {{FoodIcon5}} Food output of map tiles.
All civilizations begin the game with this technology by default.
