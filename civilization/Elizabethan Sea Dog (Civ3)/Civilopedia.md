# Elizabethan Sea Dog (Civ3)/Civilopedia

During her reign, Queen Elizabeth gave English privateers permission to fly the English flag and raid
Spanish shipping. The most notable Sea Dog of the period was Sir Francis Drake, who was responsible for
over 150 attacks on Spanish treasure ships (and still found time to circumnavigate the globe). Sir
Walter Raleigh and John Hawkins also contributed to this effort, seeing that vast quantities of 
Spanish gold and silver from the New World actually arrived in Europe on an English ship. Although numerous
other pirates sailed the seas at the time, none surpassed the efficiency and impact of the English Sea Dogs.
