# Multiplayer (CivRev)

Multiplayer is a feature in "[Civilization%20Revolution](Civilization Revolution)" that allows multiple human players to compete at the same time (instead of just competing against [AI](AI) opponents, like in [Single%20player](single-player) games). It is highly competitive, and while it is very hard to find a game, you can expect to face opponents of considerable skill once you do. It is also no longer available to the public.

These are the best, but you can make any work.
Techniques.
A good way to start is with the Spanish civilization for they have a prior knowledge of [Navigation%20%28CivRev%29](Navigation). You should then move on to build a [Galleon%20%28CivRev%29](Galleon) and look for the [Knights%20Templar%20%28CivRev%29](Knights Templar) [Artifacts%20%28CivRev%29](artifact), which will give you a random advanced [List%20of%20units%20in%20CivRev](unit) to use. Next, find the starting [Capital%20%28CivRev%29](capitals) of the other players in the game and because it is so early on in the game, you can usually take them in a few [turn](turn)s, resulting in the overall end of the game as if you have two capitals you have a massive advantage.
