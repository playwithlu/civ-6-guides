Strategy.
The main feature of the Companion Cavalry is its exceptional mobility. It has 5 MP rather than 4 MP for the standard Horseman, which makes it one of the most mobile units in the early game. A Companion Cavalry could appear out of nowhere, strike at a weak point, and then disappear again, leaving the enemy to wonder what's happened.
Also, Companion Cavalry produces [Great%20General%20%28Civ5%29](Great Generals) faster, so use it as much as possible. The Companion Cavalry loses the bonus when upgraded.
