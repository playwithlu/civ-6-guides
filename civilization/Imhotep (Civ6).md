# Imhotep (Civ6)

Imhotep is a in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". He was added in the [Babylon%20Pack%20%28Civ6%29](Babylon Pack).
Unique ability.
Grants 175 toward [Wonder%20%28Civ6%29](wonder) construction, doubled if the wonder is from the Ancient or Classical era. (2 charges)
Strategy.
350 is enough to immediately complete an Ancient Wonder, and almost entirely complete a Classical one. If the [Mausoleum%20at%20Halicarnassus%20%28Civ6%29](Mausoleum at Halicarnassus) is available, use one of Imhotep's charges to almost completely build it, then save the second one until you've built it, as the Mausoleum lets you use him a third time. Three charges of Imhotep makes you unparalleled in the early game when it comes to building wonders, even surpassing [Qin%20Shi%20Huang%20%28Civ6%29](Qin Shi Huang), as his [Builder%20%28Civ6%29](Builders) only contribute 15% of a wonder's cost per charge. If playing as [Egyptian%20%28Civ6%29](Egypt), [French%20%28Civ6%29](France), or Qin Shi Huang, do whatever it takes to get Imhotep, as he will give you a huge leg up.
