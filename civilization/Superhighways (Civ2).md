Early in his career, President Eisenhower traveled by road, from coast to coast, across the United States. This trip, which took nearly a month because of the poor system of roads, convinced him that it was necessary to make all areas of the country easily accessible. Not only were these improvements important to the growing number of people traveling by automobile, they could prove invaluable for the movement of troops and military equipment should the need arise. In 1956, Eisenhower established a federal-aid program known as the Highway Trust Fund to accelerate the construction of a network of interstate roads. By 1991, the Interstate Highway System in the U.S. consisted of over 42,000 miles of highways. Unlike local roadways, superhighways were designed to bypass large population centers, and were accessible in limited locations at planned entrance and exit interchanges. These highly efficient roadways allow motorists today to travel from one end of the country to the other without having to slow down for intersections and traffic signals.
