# Frescoes (Civ6)

Frescoes is a Wildcard [Policy%20Cards%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
Frescoes can never become [obsolete](obsolete), so for players aiming for a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Cultural Victory), this can be a permanent policy card. However, it will use up a valuable Wildcard slot. Also, since [Great%20Work%20%28Civ6%29%23Great%20Works%20of%20Art](Great Works of Art) require [Theming%20bonus%20%28Civ6%29](theming) to unleash their potential, it is less potent than either [Literary%20Tradition%20%28Civ6%29](Literary Tradition) or [Symphonies%20%28Civ6%29](Symphonies).
