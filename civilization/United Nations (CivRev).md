# United Nations (CivRev)

The United Nations is a [Wonder%20%28CivRev%29](wonder) in "[Civilization%20Revolution](Civilization Revolution)".
Building the United Nations is the final step in winning a [Victory%20%28CivRev%29](Cultural Victory). Only after acquiring 20 [Great%20Person%20%28CivRev%29](Great People), wonders, or flipping [City%20%28CivRev%29](cities) can you build this Wonder.
Like the [World%20Bank%20%28CivRev%29](World Bank), the United Nations can't be rushed by spending [Gold%20%28currency%29%20%28CivRev%29](gold) or using a Great Builder.
