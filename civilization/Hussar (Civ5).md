Strategy.
Hussars are great scouts and flankers. They are slightly faster than Cavalry, which they replace. But that's not all - they start with [Promotions%20%28Civ5%29](promotions) that give them +1 Sight and increase their bonus when making a [Flank%20attack%20%28Civ5%29](flank attack) by 50 percent, so use them accordingly.
Note that Hussars will lose their sight and bonuses once upgraded, but they will keep their flanking bonus.
