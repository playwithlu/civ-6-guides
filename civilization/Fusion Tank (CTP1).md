Great Library entry.
Constructed from improved ultrapressure and hovercraft technologies, the powerful Fusion Tank was adept at moving its massive tonnage across difficult terrain and shallow water. Reflective anti-energy shielding and a kinetic-reflex forcefield gave the F-Tank unmatched defensive armor from the 23rd to the 26th century. The F-Tank's 105mm Pulse-Plasma Cannon (PPC) obliterated enemy targets in just seconds. In 2212 a contingent of Saudi Arabian F-Tanks decimated an invasion force which outnumbered the contingent two-to-one.
