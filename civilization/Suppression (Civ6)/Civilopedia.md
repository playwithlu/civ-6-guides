# Suppression (Civ6)/Civilopedia

According to NATO, suppression is "the application of fire, direct or indirect, to destroy, neutralize or suppress the enemyâ€™s movement." Before NATO so nicely defined the term, the Royal Army defined it as "fire delivered to render a target temporarily ineffective." In other words, firing at someone tends to slow them down ... a brilliant insight that military commanders had been aware of long before NATO. But suppression fire requires a lot of ammunition fired rapidly, so it wasn't used often until the advent of industrial age warfare, when it became a common tactic.
