The first steam locomotive appeared in Wales in 1804. These early machines were plagued by the Weakness of iron rails and unreliability and inefficiency of their original apparatus. Advances in track materials and design, as well as technical advances made by such engineers as George Stephenson, made railroads more useful. The first to carry both freight and passengers, the Stockton and Darlington Railway began operations in September 1825. The Liverpool and Manchester Railway followed in 1830 with the introduction of the new locomotive "Rocket," built by Stephenson and his son, Robert. By 1841, there were more than 1,300 miles of track in Britain.
