# Modern Armor (Civ3)

Modern armor units are faster and much more powerful than ordinary [Tank%20%28Civ3%29](tanks). These are truly awesome war machines that can attack multiple times in a single turn and withdraw from combat if losing the fight (unless fighting another fast unit, of course).
A city must have aluminum, oil and rubber in its Strategic Resource box to build modern armor.
Trivia.
The Modern Armor is based on the tank.
