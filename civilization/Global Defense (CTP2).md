Great Library entry.
The second half of the twentieth century saw an escalation of tension between the Soviet Union and the United States. Although they had been allies in World War II, ideological differences cooled relations between the two nations. As each raced to mount ever greater military arsenals with which to stare each other down, and as access to each others' countries was difficult to obtain, a silent, covert war of espionage played out over the course of the 4 decades following the end of World War II.
In order to counter the growing threat of losing technology and secrets to each other, both nations bolstered their espionage efforts, expanding agencies whose sole purpose was the gathering of military intelligence. Although these organizations existed before the cold war, they began to play a crucial role in the politics of the world.
