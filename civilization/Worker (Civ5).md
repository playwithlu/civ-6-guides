# Worker (Civ5)

Game Info.
Basic economic unit of the game.
Strategy.
The Worker is vital for a [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilization) - absolutely the most important civilian unit in the game. It builds all land improvements like [Farm%20%28Civ5%29](Farms) and [Mine%20%28Civ5%29](Mines) that give access to [Resources%20%28Civ5%29](resources) and improve tile productivity. It also constructs [Road%20%28Civ5%29](roads) and [Railroad%20%28improvement%29%20%28Civ5%29](railroads) to connect the [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities), both in an empire and [City-state%20%28Civ5%29](city-states). Finally, it can repair damaged [List%20of%20improvements%20in%20Civ5](improvements).
Workers may also clean tiles from vegetation or marshland, thus freeing resources found on them for exploration.
Each of the individual improvement types, as well as the different Remove actions, only become available after you research certain [List%20of%20technologies%20in%20Civ5](technologies).
To build an improvement, the Worker needs to be within a civilization's [Territory%20%28Civ5%29](territory), so you must make sure first to expand your [Borders%20%28Civ5%29](borders) to the tile where you want to build. Roads and railroads, however, can be built both within and outside your territory. Likewise, [Fort%20%28Civ5%29](Forts) may be built and the Remove Jungle/Forest/Marsh actions may be performed outside of your territory.
While Workers cannot be gifted to a city-state, they can perform tasks such as repairing pillaged tiles in one.
The Worker is a civilian unit. While it can clear a vacant [Barbarian%20%28Civ5%29](barbarian) [Encampment%20%28Civ5%29](encampment), it cannot defend itself, so accompany it with a military unit when it is in dangerous territory. Otherwise you risk it being captured by the enemy!
On the other hand, the Worker can be used as a scout during a war because instead of being damaged or destroyed, it will only be captured and can be easily recaptured at a later time.
Once a player researches [Industrialization%20%28Civ5%29](Industrialization), all of his or her Workers change in appearance, looking more like stereotypical factory workers.
