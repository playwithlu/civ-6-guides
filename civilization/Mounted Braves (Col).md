# Mounted Braves (Col)

Native American peoples did not have access to horses until the Spanish 
brought them in the late 15th century. In some cases, Indian culture 
changed considerably to incorporate the horse as a vital element. Horses 
increase the mobility and combat power of the Indians.
If [Braves%20%28Col%29](Braves) defeat [Scouts%20%28Col%29](Scouts), they will change into Mounted Braves.
