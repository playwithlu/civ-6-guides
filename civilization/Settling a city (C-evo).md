# Settling a city (C-evo)

Settling a city in the free game "[C-evo](C-evo)" is an important feature of the early part of a game.
[City%20%28C-evo%29](Cities) can be built with [Settler%20%28C-evo%29](Settler) or [Engineer](Engineer) units. The building takes time - 9 movement points, i.e. 3 turns for an Engineer but 6 for a Settler. During that time the unit displays as a different icon but it remains a unit for purposes of defense and [Zone%20of%20control%20%28C-evo%29](ZOC). If you click on it, you may be told that it is settling down.
Location must be on a tile that is capable of being irrigated, i.e. hill, tundra, plain, prairie, or grassland. (It is, however, possible to have cities on other terrains if they are start positions on a [Map%20%28C-evo%29](map).)
The resulting city has a population of 2. Ensure that it will be viable, i.e. that the central tile plus at least one other available tile will produce 4 food units. Growth requires 5 or more food.
