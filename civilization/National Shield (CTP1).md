In the 24th century the threat of war remained real and ever-present. Technological advances in physics and genetics opened new realms of terror, and cybernetically enhanced soldiers stalked the battlefield. In response to such fears President Alberto Santos proposed the construction of a National Shield. Costly and technologically risky, many accused the president of deception. Others claimed that he'd at last shown proof of his growing senility. Nevertheless, the president pressed on. On the morning that the shield was unveiled, cheers erupted on the opening day of a decade of safety.
