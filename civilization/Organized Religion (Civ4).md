Strategy.
Organized Religion is a religious civic that gives a bonus to {{Link4|production}} in {{Link4|cities}} of the [State%20religion%20%28Civ4%29](state religion), and allows a city with a religion to build [Missionary%20%28Civ4%29](Missionaries) of that religion regardless of whether or not the city has a [Monastery%20%28Civ4%29](Monastery) of that religion.
Organized religion is also a key component for an early diplomatic victory. Since missionaries can be trained in the cities who followed that religion and also having the state religion and building the Apostolic palace. use this civic as an advantage while your missionaries are sent to foreign cities to convert their civilization to follow the religion.
