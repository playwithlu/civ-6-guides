Civilopedia entry.
The Railroads, iron mongers, and other businesses that launched the Industrial Revolution grew into great enterprises within a generation, far outstripping the resources of a single owner. The huge capital investments that Industrialization required were met in the West by Corporations of stockholders that had access to sophisticated Banking systems. These large industrial enterprises now dominate world business. Though often considered wasteful, conspiratory, and beyond the law, they are generally efficient and innovative, or they are soon out of business.
