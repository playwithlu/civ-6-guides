# Praetorian (Civ4)

The Praetorian is the [Unique%20unit%20%28Civ4%29](unique unit) of the [Roman%20%28Civ4%29](Roman) [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ4](civilization).
Strategy.
Compared to the [Swordsman%20%28Civ4%29](Swordsman) it replaces, the Praetorian has 2 more strength points, but costs 5 more hammers to build, and it also loses its 10% bonus against [City%20%28Civ4%29](cities).
Originally, when "[Civilization%20IV](Civilization IV)" first came out, the Praetorian needed only 40 hammers, but this was changed to 45 hammers in the v1.52 patch.
Using Praetorians.
Along with [War%20Elephant%20%28Civ4%29](War Elephants), Praetorians are the most powerful unit of the [Classical%20Era%20%28Civ4%29](Classical Era), and can be obtained much earlier than them. They actually usually beat unpromoted [Axeman%20%28Civ4%29](Axemen), and using the [Shock%20%28Civ4%29](Shock) [Promotion%20%28Civ4%29](promotion), this gives them the upper hand against all non-unique Classical units.
The main issue with Praetorians is their dependence on [Iron%20%28Civ4%29](Iron). Research [Iron%20Working%20%28Civ4%29](Iron Working) quickly to know the whereabouts of Iron. Building a city on a source of Iron and reinforcing it with various units will prevent pillagers from cutting off your Iron supply.
As the Romans begin the game with knowledge of [Mining%20%28Civ4%29](Mining), often it is wisest to beeline straight to Iron Working through [Bronze%20Working%20%28Civ4%29](Bronze Working) to begin pumping out Praetorians.
Against Praetorians.
Co-ordinating an attack on the Romans with other nations will stretch their efforts thin. You can try to take out their Iron supplies using fast units - at this stage in the game, there aren't very thorough [Roads%20and%20railroads%20%28Civ4%29](road) networks and [List%20of%20mounted%20units%20in%20Civ4](mounted units) can generally pillage without too much retaliation.
Prevention is better than cure if you suspect the Romans are going to go a very aggressive route very early on in the game. If you can quickly build a [Settler%20%28Civ4%29](Settler) and an [Archer%20%28Civ4%29](Archer) and claim Iron sources near the Romans before they can, they'll be stuck with weaker units.
Promoted Axemen are the best bet against Praetorians in direct combat. By sending a few Shock-promoted Axemen, you can delay the Praetorians or force them into Shock promotions, meaning your Archer-defended cities will be a little safer.
