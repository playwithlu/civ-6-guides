# Carrier (Civ4)

Strategy.
The Carrier is one of the final [Naval%20unit%20%28Civ4%29](naval units) and has room to carry 3 [Fighter%20%28Civ4%29](Fighters). They are very weak unsupported, so they should only be used with escorts or against a [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ4](civilization) with a small or nonexistent navy.
