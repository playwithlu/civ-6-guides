Rocket Artillery is the ultimate siege weapon, far superior to its predecessors. Employing a radically different launch system, this unit can launch self-propelled surface-to-surface rockets almost without any need of preparation; thus it is the only siege unit that does not need to set up before firing (making it much quicker than earlier siege weapons). It also has much greater ranged strength, making it very dangerous for modern infantry and other land or [Naval%20units%20%28Civ5%29](naval units). Although the Rocket Artillery's sight range is limited, it can use indirect fire to attack targets it cannot see (as long as other friendly units can see them). All these qualities make it deadly against enemy [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities) or other targets with limited mobility.
