# Foreign Legion (Civ5)/Civilopedia

Established in 1831, the French Foreign Legion is a unique infantry unit in the French army. The legion was specifically created for foreign nationals who wished to fight for France. Famously courageous, totally indifferent to personal safety, the Foreign Legion have seen service in every French war since their inception. The unit has been highly romanticized - according to popular culture, it is a place where heartbroken men go to forget women and scoundrels go to escape justice. This may or may not be accurate, but whatever the case the Legion is a tough and very effective fighting force.
