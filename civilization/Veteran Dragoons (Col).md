# Veteran Dragoons (Col)

Dragoons are soldiers mounted on horseback, the colonial equivalent of 
cavalry. Any soldier may be converted into a dragoon if he is given horses. 
Dragoons can move farther during a turn, and they fight more effectively. 
Veteran dragoons are more effective in battle than normal mounted 
soldiers.
