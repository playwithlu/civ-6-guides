# Civilization VI December 2020 Update

The December 2020 Update for "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)" was released on December 17th, 2020.
New features.
City-State Picker.
In Advanced Setup, players can now bring up a new menu to choose which City-States they would like to include in their next game. Selected City-States are not guaranteed to be in the next game, rather, they are part of the pool of City-States that will then be randomly selected and placed. Ones that are not selected will never appear in a game.
Searchable Unit List.
Leave no scout, archer, or Giant Death Robot behind. Players can use search and filtering functions in the World Tracker panel to quickly find any unit on the map.
Balance.
