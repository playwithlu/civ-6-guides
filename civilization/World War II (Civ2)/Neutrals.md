Try to steal as much [List%20of%20advances%20in%20Civ2](technology) as possible from the [World%20War%20II%20%28Civ2%29/Axis](Axis) (no [Reputation%20%28Civ2%29](reputation) loss while at war) and build new [City%20%28Civ2%29](cities) in the [Middle%20East](Middle East) to gain a good production base.
