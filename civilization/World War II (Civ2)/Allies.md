Allies Strategy.

The Allies start second after the [World%20War%20II%20%28Civ2%29/Axis](Axis). The civilization will, depending on the difficulty setting, may lose the [Armor%20%28Civ2%29](Armour) and other units on the European mainland.

Fighting Back.
Battle of Britain.
Depending on your difficulty settings, the Axis will definitely attack your cities and units on the British Isles. They won't create much damage or destroy many units. Move the Rifleman outside your cities into the coastal cities, ie Southampton and London. The Axis Fleet may bombard your cities but most have [Coastal%20Fortress%20%28Civ2%29](Coastal Fortress) so they will add strong defensive power.
North Africa.
The Axis will attempt to attack to attack Alexandria and the player should defend it well given the number of key wonders it has such as the [Pyramids%20%28Civ2%29](Pyramids). Once the Axis [Armor%20%28Civ2%29](Armor) is defeated, the player should attack back. Take the cities [Tripoli](Tripoli) and Tobruk. Rebuilt forces from your Arabian cities such as Jerusalem and Suez. Use your given naval units to deter or destroy Axis ships.
