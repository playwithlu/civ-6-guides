# La Venta (Civ6)

La Venta is a religious [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-state) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
La Venta offers the Colossal Head improvement, which can be a good source of {{Faith6}} and {{Tourism6}}, especially for civilizations that like to settle in [Woods%20%28Civ6%29](Woods) or [Rainforest%20%28Civ6%29](Rainforest). This civilization has good synergy with [Brazilian%20%28Civ6%29](Brazil), the [M%C4%81ori%20%28Civ6%29](MƒÅori), and [Vietnamese%20%28Civ6%29](Vietnam), all civilizations who are incentivized to preserve these natural features. Vietnam's civilization ability even allows Colossal Heads to gain adjacency bonuses from [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles) improved with [District%20%28Civ6%29](districts), as long as they are not built on [Marsh%20%28Civ6%29](Marsh).
