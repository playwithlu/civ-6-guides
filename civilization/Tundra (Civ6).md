# Tundra (Civ6)

Tundra is a type of base [Terrain%20%28Civ6%29](terrain) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is found in great expanses everywhere near the polar regions (far north and south) of the world.
Strategy.
Tundra is the third most widespread terrain in the world (after [Plains%20%28Civ6%29](Plains) and [Grassland%20%28Civ6%29](Grassland)), but with just a +1 base yield it is far less useful. You can't build [Farm%20%28Civ6%29](Farms) there, not even along [River%20%28Civ6%29](Rivers) (unlike in "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)"), which severely limits the Population growth of a [City%20%28Civ6%29](city), and the lack of native further limits its other aspects. So, unless you are playing as [Russian%20%28Civ6%29](Russia), Tundra tiles are generally poor locations to initially settle. [Canadian%20%28Civ6%29](Canada) is another exception: they can place Farms on Tundra [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles) which generate a total of +3 ([Adjacency%20bonus%20%28Civ6%29](adjacency bonuses) from [Feudalism%20%28Civ6%29](Feudalism) or [Replaceable%20Parts%20%28Civ6%29](Replaceable Parts) notwithstanding), allowing them to grow their cities large even in these desolate regions. In general, cities on or near Tundra will want any available [Resource%20%28Civ6%29](resources) such as to make the most of the environment. [Coastal%20%28Civ6%29](Coastal) cities close to sea-based resources may also circumvent some of the negatives.
It is, however, noteworthy that there are some particular resources that are found mainly in Tundra, such as and . Also, hard to find [Resource%20%28Civ6%29%23Strategic](Strategic Resources) oftentimes pop up in Tundra, or in [Coast%20%28Civ6%29](Coast) tiles near Tundra, which may also justify settling there.
Similarly to [Desert%20%28Civ6%29](Desert), there is one [Pantheon%20%28Civ6%29](pantheon) ([Dance%20of%20the%20Aurora%20%28Civ6%29](Dance of the Aurora)) that can turn Tundra into a veritable factory! Simply build a [Holy%20Site%20%28Civ6%29](Holy Site) or two in the middle of the tundra, and watch your yield climb off the charts!
