# Production (Civ3)

Production and Shields.
 Shields represent common raw materials in the countryside and the labor required to make useful materials from them. In essence they are a measure of Production. The shields a city produces are used to complete its current project, which may be to build a military unit, city improvement, or wonder. When the production box is full of shields, the project is finished, the box is emptied, and a new project must be started.
