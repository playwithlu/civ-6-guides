Lines.
Ramkhamhaeng speaks mostly modern Thai, as his language greatly differs from what is written on the stele allegedly attributed to him. The language in his day differs in grammar (mostly the omission of conjunctions) and vocabulary (the personal pronouns that were used normally in his day are considered vulgar in modern times, hence their omission from his speech by the game developers). Another somewhat amusing point is the reversal of the meaning of the word "แพ้," which is what he says when you defeat him. It means "to lose, to be defeated" in modern Thai, but in his day - and on his stele, describing his battle with the Mon people - it meant "to win, to beat."
Intro.
Greetings to you, great King Ramkhamhaeng, leader of the glorious Siamese people! O mighty King, your people bow down before you in awe and fear! You are the ruler of Siam, an ancient country in the heart of Southeast Asia. Siam is a beautiful and mysterious land. Surrounded by foes, beset by bloody war and grinding poverty, the clever and loyal Siamese people have endured and triumphed. King Ramkhamhaeng, your empire was once part of the Khmer Empire, until the 13th century AD, when your ancestors revolted, forming the small Sukhothai kingdom. Through successful battle and cunning diplomacy the tiny kingdom grew into a mighty empire, an empire which would dominate Southeast Asia for more than a century!
Oh, wise and puissant King Ramkhamhaeng, your people need you to once again lead them to greatness! Can you use your wits and strength of arms to protect your people and defeat your foes? Can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time?
