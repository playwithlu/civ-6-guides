# Bananas (Civ5)

Game Info.
Bonus resource.
Strategy.
You can also decide to develop the {{BananasIcon5}} Bananas with their proper [List%20of%20improvements%20in%20Civ5](improvement), the [Plantation%20%28Civ5%29](Plantation), which will further improve their {{Food5}} yield. However, to do so you'll need to chop down the Jungle and revert the tile to its base [Terrain%20%28Civ5%29](terrain), losing the {{Science5}} bonus. So, think carefully about what you need for your nearby [City%20%28Civ5%29](city): a big {{Food5}} booster, or a more diversified yield.
Finally, [Fort%20%28Civ5%29](Forts) can be constructed on {{BananasIcon5}} Bananas without removing the Jungle.
