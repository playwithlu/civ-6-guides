# Bananas (Civ5)

Game Info.
Bonus resource.
Strategy.
 Bananas are only found in [Jungle%20%28Civ5%29](Jungles). This makes them kind of difficult to find, but it also gives you a unique opportunity: you can use the tile without any development whatsoever! Their initial yield is +3 (thanks to the Jungle tile), and a [Granary%20%28Civ5%29](Granary) adds another point of ; on top of that, you can get a +2 boost from the Jungle tile when you build a [University%20%28Civ5%29](University)! Certain religious beliefs can add even more yield, turning a single resource tile into a plethora of opportunities.
You can also decide to develop the Bananas with their proper [List%20of%20improvements%20in%20Civ5](improvement), the [Plantation%20%28Civ5%29](Plantation), which will further improve their yield. However, to do so you'll need to chop down the Jungle and revert the tile to its base [Terrain%20%28Civ5%29](terrain), losing the bonus. So, think carefully about what you need for your nearby [City%20%28Civ5%29](city): a big booster, or a more diversified yield.
Finally, [Fort%20%28Civ5%29](Forts) can be constructed on Bananas without removing the Jungle.
