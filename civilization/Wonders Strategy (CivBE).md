# Wonders Strategy (CivBE)

If you are a budding civil engineer, and would like to beat your opponents in building every wonder in the game, then here is the strategy I use to get the job done.
Priorities.
The priority when choosing technologies, virtues, terrain upgrades/focus, and city buildings is vital for a successful and Wonderful (sic) city.
The following is the preferred priority however you can adjust this to suit your play style:
Wonder/Technology Priority.
Just as you prioritise your statistics you should also prioritise which technologies and wonders you build first.  There are other technologies which don’t have a wonder but must be researched as a pre-requisite.  There are also technologies which don’t lead to wonders but are quite useful early game. Use the Production/Science/Food filters and pick thoes up along the way.
The following is the order in which you should build your wonders with the corresponding technology that unlocks it. In brackets is the cost to unlock the technology. You can prioritize wonders with the same technology cost differently depending on your play style. You should always build all wonders at each cost level first before moving to the next cost level.
