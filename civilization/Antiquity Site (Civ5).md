Antiquity Sites are special tile features introduced as part of the [Archaeology%20%28concept%29%20%28Civ5%29](archaeological system) in "". Unlike other tile features, which are native to the land, Antiquity Sites only appear after the discovery of [Archaeology%20%28Civ5%29](Archaeology) and are related to past events in the game.

Francis Bacon wrote in 1605 that "antiquities are history defaced, or some remnants of history which have casually escaped the shipwreck of time." By definition, antiquities are objects from the past, ranging from simple arrowheads to artistic treasures. The sense that a lost civilization could be uncovered by a systematic study of its relics and artifacts has driven amateur collectors and eminent scholars for generations to seek these out, dig these up, and preserve these in homes, universities and museums. This passion for collecting the leavings of the human past eventually gave rise to a new scholarly discipline - the field of archaeology.
