# Jakarta (Civ6)

Jakarta is a trade [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-state) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". 
In the [Khmer%20and%20Indonesia%20Civilization%20%26amp%3B%20Scenario%20Pack%20%28Civ6%29](Khmer and Indonesia Civilization &amp; Scenario Pack), with the introduction of [Indonesian%20%28Civ6%29](Indonesia) as a playable [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization), Jakarta became an [Indonesian%20cities%20%28Civ6%29](Indonesian city) and was replaced with [Bandar%20Brunei%20%28Civ6%29](Bandar Brunei) under all rulesets.
Strategy.
Jakarta's [Suzerain%20%28Civ6%29](Suzerain) bonus increases the output of s, but is far less useful than the bonuses of city-states such as [Venice%20%28Civ6%29](Venice)/[Amsterdam%20%28Civ6%29](Amsterdam) and [Hunza%20%28Civ6%29](Hunza). can easily be obtained in large quantities from multiple sources, so a bonus that grants a paltry amount of per and takes time and careful attention to leverage is definitely not worth the trouble. Becoming Suzerain of Jakarta should be low on players' priority lists, because there are many other ways to earn extra that don't involve checking to see which [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) have s.
