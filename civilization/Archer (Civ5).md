# Archer (Civ5)

Game Info.
First ranged unit in the game.
Strategy.
The Archer is the earliest ranged unit, armed with the first simple bows. Because it can attack enemies with impunity up to 2 [hex](hex)es away, it is critically important in the first skirmishes with [Barbarian%20%28Civ5%29](Barbarians), or when attacking enemy [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities) early in the game.
However, the Archer is fairly weak when attacked by other units, especially in melee. Assign it to garrison cities or keep it behind your front lines, protected by melee units. Also, position it on [Hill%20%28Civ5%29](hills) whenever possible - these vantage points will allow it to use its full range while also using the natural defense of the [Terrain%20%28Civ5%29](terrain).
