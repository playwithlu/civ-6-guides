Gameplay.
Finding the bastion of the Knights Templar immediately grants its discoverer an immensely powerful unit. This is an excellent find for anyone looking to win a Domination victory
The type of unit recruited depends on which Era the artifact is discovered in and is always a veteran unit:
Using the acquired unit to gain promotions until the relevant technology enables the production of more units of the same type allows for the assembly of a powerful army and is furthest this artifact's advantage can be taken. This is especially easy if done during the Ancient Era with Barbarians as targets.
Civilopedia entry.
The Knights Templar were a military and religious organization founded in 1119 after the fall of Jerusalem to the Crusaders. Having captured the city, the Crusaders considered their job complete and left en masse for their homes, leaving Jerusalem undefended and surrounded by a really angry Arab Empire.
Rising to the defense of the city, a French knight, Hugues de Payens created an order of Knights dedicated to the protection of Christian interests in war and the protection of monastic virtues in peace. The Templars soon became the most powerful Christian organization in the Holy Land. However, they were unable to stave off the Muslims' advances forever, and with the loss of Jerusalem to the warriors of Saladin, the Templars would begin a slow decline in strength and popularity, culminating in their mass arrest by King Philip IV in 1307, who lusted after their legendary wealth.
