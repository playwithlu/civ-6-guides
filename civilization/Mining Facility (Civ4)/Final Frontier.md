Civilopedia entry.
Core Drillers - massive mining systems designed to extract the valuable materials often located within a planet's liquid center - were once considered the most efficient method of mineral extraction possible. Yet, with the collapse of several cored planets and the resulting losses of capital - not to mention life - Core Drillers have on the whole been abandoned for more traditional methods. Conventional mining systems, marked by their Space Elevator transports, have returned from the edge of obsolescence to become once again the most reliable way to increase a planet's production capabilities.
