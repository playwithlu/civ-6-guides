# Armored Tactics (Civ3)/Civilopedia

The armored fighting vehicle now commonly known as the "tank" was first used in combat by the British during WWI's
Battle of the Somme (September, 1916). The principle duties of these original, bulky rhomboidal monsters were to support
the infantry attack and create a breach in the enemy trench line. During the inter-war years much thought was given to
tank employment and design (at least by some countries), perhaps none more so than by Germany's Heinz Guderian. It was Guderian who correctly foresaw the power of the tank using blitzkrieg (or "lightening war") tactics. At the start of
WWII, the tank arsenal of most nations was composed of under-gunned light tanks. As the war progressed,
the involved nations developed heavier, larger, and ever more powerful medium and heavy tanks.
