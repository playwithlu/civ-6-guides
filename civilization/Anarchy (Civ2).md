Manual Excerpts.
"Anarchy, or the lack of government, occurs only when you lose control, either because civil unrest topples your current government, or immediately following a revolution. Civil unrest continues as long as conditions are ripe for it. In the case of a revolution, your people’s attitude naturally stabilizes. After a few turns, once your civilization settles down, a dialog box appears listing all the possible forms of government your culture has available. Choose the one you like, and that regime takes effect immediately." —Manual
"You have temporarily lost control of the government. You continue controlling the movements of your units, and cities continue to operate on their own, but some important functions of your civilization grind to a halt until control is restored..."—Manual
Civilopedia entry.
"Anarchy represents not so much a government type as the lack of any stable government. Anarchy occurs when your civilization's government falls, or when you decide to have a Revolution. After a few turns of Anarchy, you can rebuild a new government. Anarchy is similar to Despotism, except that the corruption rate is VERY HIGH. However, no taxes are collected during a period of Anarchy, and no scientific research is conducted."—Civilization II Civilopedia
