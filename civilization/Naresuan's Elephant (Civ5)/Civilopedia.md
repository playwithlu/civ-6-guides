# Naresuan's Elephant (Civ5)/Civilopedia

In Southeast Asia elephants continued to be employed in warfare far into the Middle Ages. In Siam, particularly, war elephants were highly prized, and leaders often fought from atop them. In 1593 a war between Burma and Siam ended in a Siamese victory when Siamese King Naresuan killed Burmese crown prince Minchit Sra in single combat atop elephants.
