# Krakatoa (Civ5)

Krakatoa is a [Natural%20wonder%20%28Civ5%29](natural wonder) in "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)". It spawns in [Grassland%20%28Civ5%29](grassland) and [Mountain%20%28Civ5%29](mountain) tiles.
Strategy.
Krakatoa is a volcano that appears on islands surrounded by [Coast%20%28Civ5%29](coast) tiles. Whether by design or an oversight, it is almost impossible to take advantage of in-game, as it usually appears too far from the coast to build a [City%20%28Civ5%29](city) within 3 tiles of it.Â
