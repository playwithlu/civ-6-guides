# Railroad (Civ3)

Units moving along a Railroad expend zero movement points. Railroads also increase the output of [Irrigation%20%28Civ3%29](Irrigation) or [Mine%20%28Civ3%29](Mines), by 1 food or 1 production respectively.
Workers can build railroads after the discovery of [Steam%20Power%20%28Civ3%29](Steam Power), but only if your civilization has access to the Strategic Resources [Iron%20%28Civ3%29](Iron) and [Coal%20%28Civ3%29](Coal).
Workers are ordered to build railroads by pressing [Shift-R] or the "Build Railroad" button.
