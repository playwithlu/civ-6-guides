# Mayan (Civ4)

The Mayan people (or Maya) represent a [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ4](civilization) in "[Civilization%20IV](Civilization IV)".
Strategy.
The Mayan Empire is wealthy, healthy and happy. [Pacal%20II%20%28Civ4%29](Pacal's) "[Financial%20%28Civ4%29](Financial)" [Leader%20trait%20%28Civ4%29](trait) adds a bonus to any plot producing 2 commerce, while his "[Expansive%20%28Civ4%29](Expansive)" trait not only provides extra health to your [City%20%28Civ4%29](cities), but also allows [Worker%20%28Civ4%29](Workers) to quickly improve new plots to take advantage of the "Financial" trait. Have your Workers build a few [Cottage%20%28Civ4%29](Hamlets) and watch the money roll in. And while money can't buy happiness, the [Ball%20Court%20%28Civ4%29](Ball Court) certainly can, making your newly wealthy citizens jubilant. Even without the [Holkan%20%28Civ4%29](Holkan), a [Spearman%20%28Civ4%29](Spearman) that requires no [Copper%20%28Civ4%29](Copper), the Mayans would surely be an early game powerhouse.
