Born in 1564 in Pisa, Italy, Galileo Galilei shocked the religious world with his observation that the Earth revolved around the Sun. In 1609, after hearing of the invention of the telescope in Holland, Galileo engineered an improved version for himself, soon discovering the rings of Saturn and the moons of Jupiter. Later he adapted lenses to create the first microscope and defined the nature of the pendulum clock. Still his greatest fame came from his stand against the church. In 1632 Galileo was summoned to Rome for teaching Copernicus's theory of a sun-centered solar system and was forced into exile as a result.
