Uses.
 Culture has two main uses: border expansion and [Virtues%20%28CivBE%29](Virtues) acquisition. At the [City%20%28CivBE%29](city) level, the local Culture yield is used to determine how fast the city territory will occupy new tiles nearby (only applies to land cities). At the [Colony%20%28CivBE%29](colony) level, the Culture yields of all cities plus any bonuses gather into a pool which is used to acquire Virtues and advance your colony's social organisation.
