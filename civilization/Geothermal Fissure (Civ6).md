# Geothermal Fissure (Civ6)

A Geothermal Fissure is a type of [Terrain%20%28Civ6%29%23Features](terrain feature) in "". 
Strategy.
Geothermal Fissures are often found at the foot of [Mountains%20%28Civ6%29](Mountains) and [Volcano%20%28Civ6%29](Volcanoes), or at land boundaries between [Continent%20%28Civ6%29](continents), and present ideal locations for [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities). [Campus%20%28Civ6%29](Campuses) built next to them enjoy rich [Adjacency%20bonus%20%28Civ6%29](adjacency bonuses), [Aqueduct%20%28Civ6%29](Aqueducts) (and the [Roman%20%28Civ6%29](Roman) [Bath%20%28Civ6%29](Bath)) built next to a Geothermal Fissure provide 1 , and with [Synthetic%20Materials%20%28Civ6%29](Synthetic Materials), [Geothermal%20Plant%20%28Civ6%29](Geothermal Plants) can be built on them to provide a city with additional , , and clean . No other [District%20%28Civ6%29](districts), [Wonder%20%28Civ6%29](wonders), or [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](tile improvements) can be built on them.
Only the [Hungarian%20%28Civ6%29](Hungarians) and the [Spanish%20%28Civ6%29](Spanish) have a [Starting%20bias%20%28Civ6%29](starting bias) towards Geothermal Fissures. Hungary's [Thermal%20Bath%20%28Civ6%29](Thermal Bath) is much stronger than the [Zoo%20%28Civ6%29](Zoo) it replaces, which can help tremendously with keeping newly conquered cities happy and loyal, although no one really wants to spend on many [Entertainment%20Complex%20%28Civ6%29](Entertainment Complexes) and their [Building%20%28Civ6%29](buildings). Also, thanks to the Pearl of the Danube [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](ability), Hungary can quickly and consistently build high-adjacency Campuses from the moment they research [Writing%20%28Civ6%29](Writing).
On an [Earth%20%28map%29%20%28Civ6%29](Earth) [Map%20%28Civ6%29](map), there will always be two Geothermal Fissures near [Mount%20Kilimanjaro%20%28Civ6%29](Mount Kilimanjaro). Players who spawn in [Africa](Africa) should attempt to settle near them, especially if is an important part of their strategy.
