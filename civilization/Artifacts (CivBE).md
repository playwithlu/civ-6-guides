# Artifacts (CivBE)

&lt;choose&gt;
&lt;/choose&gt;
Artifacts have been added to ' in the ' expansion. In this system, players collect and combine powerful relics for powerful bonuses.
Artifact types and acquisition.
In all cases, there is no guaranteed method of acquiring an artifact. Each applicable method only has a random chance of providing an artifact, in addition to normal rewards. For each artifact category, there is a base acquisition rate:
After each expedition or destroyed nest, if no artifact was acquired, the acquisition rate for the corresponding category is increased:
Although the artifact category is set, the quality and type of the artifact is randomly generated each time one is acquired. If a civilization is holding a certain type of artifact, chances are much lower a second duplicate of that type will be acquired, even if it is of a different quality level. Thus, if a civilization hoards artifacts, it should be able to gain a wider variety of artifacts and rewards from which to choose.
Artifact usage.
Players have the choice of either immediately using one, two, or three artifacts to gain varying bonuses. Using one or two artifacts provides a small amount of , , or . Waiting to combine a group of two or three will unlock a [Wonders%20%28CivBE%29](wonder), [Building%20%28CivBE%29](building), or other perk.
Artifacts can be found in three conditions:
Artifact rewards.
Each artifact combination is a part of a list of possible rewards.
For artifacts of a similar category, the possible reward list is formed from the preferred reward property of each artifact used.
For mixed category artifacts, the possible reward list is formed from the preferred reward property of each artifact used and its special (category-less) reward set.
No civilization can receive the same reward twice, so if one has received all of the rewards from the selected artifacts, other rewards from the same category of artifacts are added to the possible reward list.
If all of the rewards from this artifact category are received by a civilization, all remaining rewards are added to the possible reward list.
