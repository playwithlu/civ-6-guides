# Great Isle (C-evo)

Great Isle is the name of one of the [Predesigned%20maps%20%28C-evo%29](Predesigned maps) that are downloadable with the free game [C-evo](C-evo).
Quite large at "375% size", it allows the standard number of players (15). Because there are 24 possible [Starting%20Position%20%28C-evo%29](Starting Position)s fairly evenly spaced around a large, almost circular, island, a player may find several very close rivals or find sparse areas capable of almost uninterrupted colonization for a few centuries.
The map is interesting, with very well-designed variety of [terrain%20%28C-evo%29](terrain) including numerous [river%20%28C-evo%29](river)s and maybe a bit of a bonus for the first players to research [Navigation%20%28C-evo%29](Navigation). If you don't want to spoil the surprise, don't give in to the temptation to use the map editing function to get a sneak preview.
However, several of the starting positions are on [forest%20%28C-evo%29](forest) or [swamp%20%28C-evo%29](swamp) (which is strictly illegal according to the normal map-editing rules), or on [tundra%20%28C-evo%29](tundra), which is depressingly unproductive, and a few nations are so poorly placed that three of them starve to death by 3800 BC while several others need to irrigate before they can grow.
A further non-standard feature is that there is no [Mercury%20%28C-evo%29](Mercury), so you cannot score a proper win by building a [spaceship%20%28C-evo%29](spaceship).
Because of the arrangement of coastlines, a defensive stance can be fairly easily maintained using air units.
