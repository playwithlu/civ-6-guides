# Bioenhancement Center (SMAC)

 is a [base%20facility%20%28SMAC%29](base facility) in "[Sid%20Meier%27s%20Alpha%20Centauri](Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri)". Adds +2 morale to conventional units and +1 lifecycle to psi units. 
Strategy.
This is most useful to build in addition to one of the other enhancement facilities: command center, aerospace complex, brood pit, etc. Such a combination will produce units that start at veteran status, or even commando or elite depending upon your social choices.
