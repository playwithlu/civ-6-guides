# Gurdwara (Civ6)

The Gurdwara is an advanced [Religion%20%28Civ6%29](religious) [Building%20%28Civ6%29](building) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is built in the [Holy%20Site%20%28Civ6%29](Holy Site) [District%20%28Civ6%29](district) and requires a [Temple%20%28Civ6%29](Temple) (or one of its replacements). It may also be purchased with {{Faith6}}.
Strategy.
The Gurdwara allows Holy Sites to increase [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) growth, especially if combined with the Feed the World [Beliefs%20%28Civ6%29%23Follower](follower belief). Note that the {{Food6}} bonus doesn't do much good without corresponding {{Housing6}} capacity, so this Worship building is helpful either when your cities are settled in [Plains%20%28Civ6%29](Plains), [Tundra%20%28Civ6%29](Tundra), or [Desert%20%28Civ6%29](Desert) where {{Food6}} sources are scarce, or when you're playing as a [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) with early to midgame {{Housing6}} bonuses, like [Indian%20%28Civ6%29](India) or [Kongolese%20%28Civ6%29](Kongo). Otherwise, all this building does is make you run into {{Housing6}} issues even sooner, which is inadvisable.
In "", the Gurdwara also grants 1 extra {{Housing6}}, which makes it a bit stronger for any civilization that loves building populous cities.
