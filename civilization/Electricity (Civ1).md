# Electricity (Civ1)

Electricity is the energy made available by the flow of electrical charge through a conductor.
It is a prerequisite of [Advanced%20Flight%20%28Civ1%29](advanced flight) and [Electronics%20%28Civ1%29](electronics).
It negates the effects of the [Colossus%20%28Civ1%29](Colossus).
Civilopedia entry.
The phenomenon of Electricity has been witnessed by humans since the dawn of time in the form of lightning, static Electricity, and Magnetism, but only in the last two hundred years has the energy of charged particles been harnessed. Electric current is a flow of electrons from an electromotive force, such as a battery or generator, that possesses a negative charge. The current flows through a conductor of electricity (a copper wire for example) to a positive terminal that attracts the charge. Along the way, the electric current can be made to provide power and do work.
