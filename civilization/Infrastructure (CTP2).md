# Infrastructure (CTP2)

Gameplay.
In "Call To Power II", a city's industry can be converted to {{LinkCTP2|Public Works}}. {{LinkCTP2|Public Works}} can be used to build {{LinkCTP2|Farms}}, {{LinkCTP2|Roads}}, {{LinkCTP2|Mines}} and other {{LinkCTP2|Tile Improvements}}. With Infrastructure, the total {{LinkCTP2|Production}} output of the city is converted and folded into your {{LinkCTP2|Public Works}} pool of resources every turn. Once Infrastructure is selected in the build queue, it need not be reselected in order to carry over to the next turn.
