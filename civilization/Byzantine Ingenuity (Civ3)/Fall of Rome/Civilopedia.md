# Byzantine Ingenuity (Civ3)/Fall of Rome/Civilopedia

Callinicus of Heliopolis, a Syrian refuge, is the Byzantine citizen given credit with the invention of Greek Fire. Although the exact chemical composition of this substance is still unknown, we do know that it was heated over a cauldron and then pumped out through a siphon and exposed to flame. The effect was to allow the Byzantines to project flaming liquid (that would still burn when exposed to water) over long distances. This ancient flamethrower was mounted on the Dromon and forced opposing navies to steer clear of the Byzantine fleet at all costs. Constantinople was saved from Arab siege for centuries by this ingenious invention.
