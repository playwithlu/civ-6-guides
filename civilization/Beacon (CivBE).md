# Beacon (CivBE)

The Beacon can be built after the {{LinkBE|Decode Signal}} Project is completed. Once the Beacon is built, it must be activated. It costs 1000 {{EnergyBE}} to activate, and "will consume all surplus {{EnergyBE}} each turn it is active." However, this effectively sets the Energy per turn to zero, so if the Energy per turn is currently negative, it will be set to zero, a significant advantage. Switching the city production away from the Beacon during construction will erase all progress.
Once activated, it takes 45 turns to make contact (This changes based on game speed). Energy income does not lower the number of turns.
Pillaging, quests and the Siphon Energy covert operation are the only way to earn energy after activation. (beacon cannot be paused)
The Beacon must be built on an owned tile within 5 distance of the city constructing it. This tile becomes impassable to both military and civilian units.
The tile containing the Beacon can be attacked and destroyed by enemy units.
