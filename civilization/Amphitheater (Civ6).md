# Amphitheater (Civ6)

The Amphitheater is a basic [Culture%20%28Civ6%29](cultural) [Building%20%28Civ6%29](building) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is built in the {{Link6|Theater Square}} {{Link6|district}} (or one of its replacements).
Strategy.
Besides being the first true booster for art-related {{GreatPeople6}}, the Amphitheater also provides the first slots for [Great%20Work%20%28Civ6%29](Great Works) in your empire. It won't do you any good to attract a [Great%20Writer%20%28Civ6%29](Great Writer) (if you manage it somehow, without this building) and then have nowhere to put their writings!
In "", each cultural [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-state) with 3 or more {{Envoy6}}s gives an additional +2 {{Culture6}} in each Amphitheater.
