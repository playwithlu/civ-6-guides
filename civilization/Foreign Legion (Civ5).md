Strategy.
In vanilla "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)" and ', the Foreign Legion gives the French the ability to continue on the offensive in the dawn of the [Modern%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Modern Era). The Foreign Lands Bonus transfers to the later [Infantry%20%28Civ5%29](Infantry) and [Mechanized%20Infantry%20%28Civ5%29](Mechanized Infantry) units, so they can turn into an offensive civilization in the endgame.
In "", the Foreign Legion is a special unit, only available through the Volunteer Army tenet of the [Ideology%20%28Civ5%29%23Freedom](Freedom Ideology), or gifted by Militaristic City-States. It is slightly less powerful than a Great War Infantry, but it has a Foreign Lands Combat Bonus [Promotions%20%28Civ5%29](promotion) (which transfers on upgrade), making it an excellent unit to use on the offensive. A nation which adopts the Volunteer Army tenet receives six of these immediately, maintenance-free, which in many cases could confer an immediate military advantage over its neighbors.
