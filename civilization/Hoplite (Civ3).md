# Hoplite (Civ3)

Perhaps the best defender in the ancient era, the [Greece%20%28Civ3%29](Greek) Hoplite can dominate the Bronze Age world. It replaces the [Spearman%20%28Civ3%29](Spearman).
Hoplites were well-trained citizen-soldiers of ancient Greece. Armed with spears and durable armor, they
fulfilled the heavy infantry role in most engagements.
