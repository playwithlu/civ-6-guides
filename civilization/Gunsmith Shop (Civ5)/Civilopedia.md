# Gunsmith Shop (Civ5)/Civilopedia

Gunsmiths are skilled craftsmen devoted to the design, modification, manufacture and repair of firearms. Before the advent of Eli Whitney's Mill River Armory in the 1790s and Samuel Colt's mass production of handguns at his factories in Hartford (USA) and London (UK) in the mid-1800s, the gunsmith shop was a vital establishment in any "civilized" settlement.
