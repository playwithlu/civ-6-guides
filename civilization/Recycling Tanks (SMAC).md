# Recycling Tanks (SMAC)

 is a [base%20facility%20%28SMAC%29](base facility) in "[Sid%20Meier%27s%20Alpha%20Centauri](Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri)". 
Strategy.
The Recycling Tanks provides +1 nutrient, mineral, and energy per turn in the base square of the base in which it is built. The Pressure Dome can serve the same function as a Recycling Tanks but also protects the base in case it gets submerged in the sea...but it costs twice as much to build. Sea bases are automatically equipped with a Pressure Dome (so Svensgaard will rarely have to worry about Recycling Tanks).
These are generally a waste of resources to build, except at the very beginning of the game or for a base in a particularly resource-poor area. Make a former instead, and use it to build a farm, a mine, and a solar panel. This will produce a much greater payoff in a much shorter time. Plus you'll have the former afterward to use for other things.
