# Monarchy (Civ5)

Monarchy is a [Social%20policies%20%28Civ5%29](social policy) in "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)". It is part of the [Tradition%20%28Civ5%29](Tradition) tree and requires [Legalism%20%28Civ5%29](Legalism).
The development of the mature form of feudalism, the Monarchy, turns the center of imperial power into a shining jewel of civilized life. A single ruler, a splendid king or queen, now concentrates all the attention and admiration of his or her subjects, centralizing most entertainment, culture and even commerce.
Strategy.
This level 3 Policy is a great all-around bonus, giving an immediate boost, as well as subsequent bonuses as the {{Population5}} of your {{Capital5}} increases (as it should, thanks to the other Policies in the tree). The only consideration to make is whether you should adopt it before or after [Landed%20Elite%20%28Civ5%29](Landed Elite). Because the latter has a truly outstanding long-term bonus, it is usually better to adopt it first; if you're strapped for cash, however, or in trouble with your {{Happiness5}}, Monarchy will greatly help you. Again, the more {{Citizen5}}s in your {{Capital5}}, the greater the immediate effect!
As it affects {{Happiness5}} and therefore expansion potential, it is one of the longer lasting policies from the two early policy trees. It contrasts with [Meritocracy%20%28Civ5%29](Meritocracy) from the {{Link5|Tradition}} tree, which is proportional to the {{Population5}} as a whole (instead of just the {{Capital5}}).
