# Man-O-War (Col)

These powerful vessels appear in American waters when the War of Independence develops. Your mother country will send them against your 
forces, and, if foreign intervention occurs, you'll receive some to support your cause. They are heavily armed with cannon and capable of carrying 
large invasion forces or cargoes.
