Great Library entry.
The Wright brothers developed the first powered airplane, flying at Kill Devil in 1903. In World War I aircraft initially acted only as spotters for artillery. Soon though, pilots began carrying small bombs that they dropped by hand on the enemy. To drive off enemy planes, pilots turned first to handguns and then to machine guns mounted on the wings or fuselage. World War II proved the dominance of the new airplane. With improved range, firepower, and accuracy, control of the air determined victory in many battles.
