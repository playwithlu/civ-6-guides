# Spanish (Col)

The Spanish have a 50% military bonus against native villages. Using this skill leads to a lot of [treasure%20%28Col%29](treasure) and maybe [Indian%20Converts%20%28Col%29](converts), and eliminates a potential threat (but also potential ally and trading partner). This bonus alludes to the aftermath of the Reconquista, which left the Spanish with a huge eager military with nothing to do; they were then sent to colonize the Americas, ultimately wiping out some of the land's most legendary tribes.
