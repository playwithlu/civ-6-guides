# Literature (Civ4)

Strategy.
Literature can speed up the production of military units and Great People points and can also increase research. 
First, the [Heroic%20Epic%20%28Civ4%29](Heroic Epic) national wonder doubles military unit production in its home city. To build the Heroic Epic, the player must have a unit of level 4 or higher. The [National%20Epic%20%28Civ4%29](National Epic) national wonder and [Great%20Library%20%28Civ4%29](Great Library) world wonder both increase a player's production of Great People points. By granting two free scientists in its home city, the Great Library also aids research.
