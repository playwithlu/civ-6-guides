# Krak des Chevaliers (Civ3)/Civilopedia

The Krak des Chevaliers was the largest and strongest of the crusader castles built in the early Middle Ages. Built by the 
Knights Hospitaller, it sat atop a broad ridge in western Syria, and commanded the countryside for miles around. Its ability to supply a 
huge garrison allowed the crusaders to hold the castle for over 100 years, until a massive Muslim assault in 1271 brought it permanently 
under Islamic control.
