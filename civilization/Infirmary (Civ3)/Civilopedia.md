# Infirmary (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Infirmaries are institutions that focus on the diagnosis and treatment of disease and trauma. While dispensing these services, 
they also provide housing. With technological innovation in medicine, infirmaries have increasingly become community hubs, 
expanding their role to include teaching and research.
