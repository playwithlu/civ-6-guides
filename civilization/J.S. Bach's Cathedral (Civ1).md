Few composers were more prolific or beloved than Johann Sebastian Bach, the best-known member of a gifted family of German musicians. Bach was perhaps the finest proponent of the baroque style of music, as demonstrated in his numerous choral and orchestral pieces. Bach was more renowned during his lifetime as an organist and music director of St. Thomas Church in Leipzig, Saxony. But since his passing, his music has found a worldwide audience and appreciation.
