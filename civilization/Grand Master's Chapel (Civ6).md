# Grand Master's Chapel (Civ6)

The Grand Master's Chapel is a Tier 2 [Government%20%28Civ6%29](government) [Building%20%28Civ6%29](building) in "". It is built in the [Government%20Plaza%20%28Civ6%29](Government Plaza) [District%20%28Civ6%29](district) and requires a Tier 2 government ([Merchant%20Republic%20%28Civ6%29](Merchant Republic), [Monarchy%20%28Civ6%29](Monarchy), or [Theocracy%20%28Civ6%29](Theocracy)) and a Tier 1 government building ([Ancestral%20Hall%20%28Civ6%29](Ancestral Hall), [Audience%20Chamber%20%28Civ6%29](Audience Chamber), or [Warlord%27s%20Throne%20%28Civ6%29](Warlord's Throne)).
Strategy.
The Grand Master's Chapel is a brilliant building for every [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) that has a great output, as they can quickly "pray" an army into existence. Religious civilizations such as [Spanish%20%28Civ6%29](Spain), [Georgian%20%28Civ6%29](Georgia), [Malian%20%28Civ6%29](Mali), [Ethiopia%20%28Civ6%29](Ethiopia), and [Polish%20%28Civ6%29](Poland), who place great emphasis on spreading and defending their [Religion%20%28Civ6%29](religion), should pick up this building along with [Theocracy%20%28Civ6%29](Theocracy) as their Tier 2 government.
Georgia in particular can make great use of the Grand Master's Chapel, since [Tamar%20%28Civ6%29](Tamar) can get from [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](unit) kills. Although [Indonesian%20%28Civ6%29](Indonesia) doesn't fit the above description as well as the other civilizations, building the Grand Master's Chapel will make them the only civilization in the game that can purchase both land and [Naval%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](naval units) with , thus allowing them to raise a huge army and navy even if their output is poor. This building also has great synergy with [Norwegian%20%28Civ6%29](Norway), which will be looking to pillage a lot of [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles) regardless.
