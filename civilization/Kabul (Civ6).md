# Kabul (Civ6)

Kabul is a militaristic [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-state) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". 
Stategy.
Kabul's unique Suzerainty bonus is really good in any situation that involves using your troops, but it can only be put to its fullest efficiency by highly aggressive and quick-attacking civs, so it should be one of your main Envoy targets when playing as Persia, Mongolia, Chandragupta's India, Gorgo's Greece or the Zulu.
