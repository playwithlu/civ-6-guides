# Scythian Rider (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Being a tribe of the open steppe, Scythians were trained almost from birth the art of riding horseback. By the
time the young male came of age he was probably an expert horseman, well drilled at loading his bow and launching
its deadly projectiles while on a galloping steed. The Scythians were among the first to domesticate the horse, and
perhaps the first of the Central Asian people to learn to ride it. As they penetrated into other lands the technique
of horseback riding was rapidly adopted and mastered throughout the entire region. Although the Scythians had elaborate
bitted bridles, the stirrup was unknown to them, thus they rode on saddlecloths, relying on a strong grip and superb
balance. The Scythians were extremely formidable horsemen in battle.
