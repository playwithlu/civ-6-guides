# Nalanda (Civ6)

Nalanda is a scientific [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-state) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It was added in the [Babylon%20Pack%20%28Civ6%29](Babylon Pack).
Strategy.
Regardless of what your [Victory%20%28Civ6%29](victory) type or [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) is, try to become the [Suzerain%20%28Civ6%29](Suzerain) of Nalanda at least once in order to build a [Mahavihara%20%28Civ6%29](Mahavihara). Once built anywhere in your empire, you are gifted a free [Technology%20%28Civ6%29](technology). It only works once and the granted technology is random, so there is little strategy that can be planned to get you what you really want, but free at any point of the game should be a welcome bonus.
If you don't need additional Mahavihara after your first one, conquer this city-state to deny your opponents the boost.
