# Anarchy (C-evo)

Anarchy in "[C-evo](C-evo)" is similar to the concept in other [Civilization%20%28series%29]("Civ"-series) games: a state between proper [Government%20%28C-evo%29](governments), either by design during a revolution or after a capture while a [City%20%28C-evo%29](city) recovers. Anarchy lasts for three turns, during which each affected city's [List%20of%20units%20in%20C-evo](units) need no support and [Building%20%28C-evo%29](buildings) need no maintenance.
You cannot sell buildings or "home" units in any city that is enduring anarchy, nor can any other [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20C-evo](nation) engage in diplomacy with you when your whole nation is in anarchy. 
The on-screen Manual describes it at the bottom of the "Government Forms" page.
Amusingly, if you are having a revolution and try to sell a building you may be told "This city is not under control yet.", even if you have owned it since [4000%20BC](4000 BC).
