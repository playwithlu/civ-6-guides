# Scripture (Civ6)

Scripture is an Economic [Policy%20Cards%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
This is one of the first Economic Policies designed to boost a specific yield ( in this case) other than or . It works by doubling adjacency bonuses of a ; this means that first, you have to have such districts, and second, they have to have adjacency bonuses if you are to make use of Scripture. What's more, districts which have higher native adjacency bonuses will benefit more from this Policy than ones with low bonuses.
Policies such as Scripture, whose value is based on adjacency bonuses, are more efficient in the early and middle game than those based on [Buildings%20%28Civ6%29](buildings) within districts, simply because in the early game you haven't unlocked and/or built these buildings, while adjacency bonuses work from the very moment you establish the District. Later in the game, however, the latter type of Policies will give you a higher output than the former.
