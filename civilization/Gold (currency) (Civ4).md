# Gold (currency) (Civ4)

 
Gold is money in "[Civilization%20IV](Civilization IV)". It is used to maintain cities and units, and to buy many things. Gold is represented in the game by the gold icon (), which looks like two stacks of gold coins. For this reason gold is sometimes called "coins" by players; once gold is in the treasury it is also referred to as money.
Gold is also the name for a tile resource (), and its associated trade resource. Gold should not be mistaken for [Commerce%20%28Civ4%29](commerce) (), even though both use somewhat similar icons.
Base Gold and Finished Gold.
There are two kinds of gold used in the computation of [Production%20%28Civ4%29](production): base gold, and finished gold. Base gold is what most gold-producing processes yield. Base gold is then multiplied in a city by gold multiplying buildings (e.g., a [Bank%20%28Civ4%29](Bank)), yielding finished gold. Finished gold is the value that (after deductions for [Maintenance%20%28Civ4%29](maintenance)) is added to the civilization's treasury. Usually the context in which "gold" is mentioned should be sufficient to make it clear which sort is being referred to.
Note that the terminology used here is particular to this wiki. There are no general terms used in the community distinguishing the two types of gold.
Gold Production Methods.
Gold is produced in several ways, in all cases in a [City%20%28Civ4%29](city):
Gold Multipliers.
All base gold produced in a city may be multiplied if the city has many different [List%20of%20buildings%20in%20Civ4](buildings), as follows:
When multiple gold multiplier buildings are present, their effects are cumulative. For example, a city with a Market and a Bank gets +75% gold; that is, its base gold is multiplied by 1.75 to determine its finished gold.
Gold Spending.
All finished gold, minus a civilization's maintenance costs, is added to (or subtracted from) the civ's treasury. From there it may be spent in many ways; see the [Treasury%20%28Civ4%29](Treasury) article for more details.
With the [Universal%20Suffrage%20%28Civ4%29](Universal Suffrage) civic, cities may spend gold to hurry production (at the rate of 3 gold per missing hammer needed for completion).
