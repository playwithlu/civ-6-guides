# Heavy Cavalry (unit) (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Heavy cavalry represents well-armed and well-trained horse troops. Ancient heavy cavalry would usually
be armed with a long thrusting spear, as well as a short sword for
closer encounters. Such a band of veteran cavalry would typically have little trouble dealing with a
similar-sized group of barbarian cavalry lacking the same training and cohesiveness.
