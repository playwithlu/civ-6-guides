# Babylonian (Civ4)

The Babylonian people represent a [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ4](civilization) in "[Civilization%20IV](Civilization IV)".
Strategy.
The Babylonians don't just walk the line between Builder and Warmonger: they've settled down to raise a civilization on it. [Hammurabi%20%28Civ4%29](Hammurabi's) "[Organized%20%28Civ4%29](Organized)" trait and the health-yielding [Garden%20%28Civ4%29](Garden) building, the Babylonian replacement for the [Colosseum%20%28Civ4%29](Colosseum), make Babylonian cities fast-growing affairs. But Hammurabi's "[Aggressive%20%28Civ4%29](Aggressive)" trait and the [Bowman%20%28Civ4%29](Bowman's) significant bonus against melee units allow Babylonian players to wreak impressive early-game havoc.
