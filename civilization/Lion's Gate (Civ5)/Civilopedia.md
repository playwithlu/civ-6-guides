Found in Hattusa, the capital city of the Hittite Empire, the Lion's Gate was a large arching entryway thought to have been constructed sometime around the 14th century BC. Each side of the gate features the likeness of a large stone lion, a creature of symbolic importance to the Hittite society that was commonly found on many of their structures and monuments.
