# Cheating (Civ1)

Most games have cheats and tricks. "[Sid%20Meier%27s%20Civilization](Sid Meier's Civilization)" is no exception.
[Shift]56.
This only works in versions ending in 1, for example: 474.01 or 475.01. May need repeating a few times before it responds.
Beware problems with some of the function keys. F4, F5, and F6 work as normal, F7 as above, but some others don't and may even lock up the system.
To revert to normal mode, repeat the key sequence.
The cheat mode actually is toggled by typing %^ (percent sign and circumflex accent), which corresponds to [Shift]56 on U.S. and U.K. keyboard layouts, but not on various international layouts. Users who use one of those other layouts or who wish to memorize a key sequence that works independently of keyboard layout should consider %^ as the cheat code.
Preventing mass betrayal after 1 AD (DOS version).
There's hidden rule within the "Civilization" game, activating after 1 AD, which forces every [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ1](nation) that has more than one city to betray you, as long as you have the most powerful civilization and do not have [Nuclear%20%28Civ1%29](nuclear weapons). To disable such behavior, open CIV.EXE with any hex editor and find first sequence of bits (in hex): 81 3E ** ** C8 00 7E 56 (* - any hexademical digit, may vary in different versions of the game). Replace “C8 00” with “FF 7F” and save the file. Problem should be solved: the rivals are still able to betray you, but only if they deem it worthy on their own.
Purchasing military units.
Military units usually cost twice as much as city improvements to purchase using [Gold%20%28currency%29%20%28Civ1%29](gold), but it is possible to purchase an improvement and then change the project to a military unit costing the same number of resources (e.g., a Temple and a [Catapult%20%28Civ1%29](Catapult)).
Cancelling Settlers' orders.
Repeated clicking of [Settlers%20%28Civ1%29](Settlers) may speed up their [Roads%20%28Civ1%29](road), [RailRoad%20%28Civ1%29](rail), [Irrigation%20%28Civ1%29](irritgation) or [Mine%20%28Civ1%29](mining) work.
