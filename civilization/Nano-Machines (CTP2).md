Great Library entry.
Throughout the 21st and 22nd centuries, scientists researched and developed new applications for nanotechnology. Some of these included a device that used nanites, self-reliant nano-scale "robots" manufactured for a specific purpose, to seek out and defuse every nuclear weapon in the world. Cities desperate for a way to meet the rising water demands of its citizens built Aqua-Filters, which deployed nanite "scrubbers" to extract pure water from abundant sources such as agricultural runoff and sewage. Mining methods were forever altered by the introduction of underwater nanite miners, which could troll the sea floor, tirelessly extracting precious resources from the sea floor and water.
