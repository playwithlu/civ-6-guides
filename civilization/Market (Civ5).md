# Market (Civ5)

Game Info.
Basic money-boosting building of the [Classical%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Classical Era).
Strategy.
The Market is the first money-boosting building, significantly increasing a [City%20%28Civ5%29](city's) output of {{Gold5}}. It usually becomes available at a moment in the [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilization's) development when it's short on {{Gold5}} (you've accumulated buildings and [Unit%20%28Civ5%29](units), you're starting to build your [Road%20%28Civ5%29](road) system, but aren't trading with other civilizations much yet) so it is important to research [Currency%20%28Civ5%29](Currency) and start building it in your cities to overcome the shortage. Build it in cities with good {{Gold5}} output first - this way, the 25% boost will have greater effect earlier on. It also allows the creation of one {{Merchant5}}, increasing the speed at which [Great%20Merchant%20%28Civ5%29](Great Merchants) appear.
You need a Market in every city to unlock the [National%20Treasury%20%28Civ5%29](National Treasury) (or the [East%20India%20Company%20%28Civ5%29](East India Company) in "").
In "Brave New World" the Market's general purpose changes a bit, becoming a booster for {{InternationalTrade5}}. The Market becomes more effective as the number of {{TradeRoute5BNW}}s passing through a city increases, so when prioritizing where to build it first, check and see which of your cities have the most Trade Routes with other civilizations.
