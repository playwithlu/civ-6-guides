# Streamlined Production (Civ4)/Final Frontier/Civilopedia

As the space age grew from its infancy, infrastructure improvements led to the refinement of industrial Research and Development practices.

Developments in infrastructure likewise led to the support of massive planet-wide manufacturing facilities, Factories, which increased production wherever they were constructed.
