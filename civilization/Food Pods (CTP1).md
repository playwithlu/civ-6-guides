Gameplay.
Food pods are enclosed space-based farms that use weightless farming techniques to create +20 when worked. This improvement costs 600 PW and takes two turns to build in space.
Great Library entry.
Scientists and engineers agreed that transporting food from the earth into space would cost more than developing farming techniques in space. Early experiments in the late 20th century proved fruitful with the development of food pods. Though the pods did not yield large crops, they provided enough food to support progress in space exploration and development into the 21st century.
