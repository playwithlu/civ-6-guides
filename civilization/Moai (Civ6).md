# Moai (Civ6)

+1 {{Culture6}} for every 2 adjacent Moai (increased for every adjacent Moai with {{Link6|Medieval Faires}}).
+2 {{Culture6}} if on or adjacent to a {{Link6|Volcanic Soil}} tile.
+1 {{Culture6}} if adjacent to a {{Link6|Coast}} or {{Link6|Lake}} tile.
Moai are a special [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](tile improvement) in "". They can be built by a player that is the {{Link6|Suzerain}} of the [Rapa%20Nui%20%28Civ6%29](Rapa Nui) {{Link6|city-state}}.
Strategy.
The Moai is a great city-state tile improvement, especially on [Map%20%28Civ6%29](maps) where [Volcano%20%28Civ6%29](Volcanoes) are abundant (most notably the Primordial map). If you lead a [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) that lags behind in {{Culture6}} generation, or a {{Tourism6}} powerhouse that just unlockedÂ [Flight%20%28Civ6%29](Flight), Rapa Nui is the one city-state whose Suzerainty you need to contest. Keep in mind that Moai are rather underwhelming when not built on [Coast%20%28Civ6%29](Coast), [Lake%20%28Civ6%29](Lake), or [Volcanic%20Soil%20%28Civ6%29](Volcanic Soil); if you have a landlocked empire with no Volcanic Soil nearby, Rapa Nui shouldn't be too high on your list of contested city-states.
