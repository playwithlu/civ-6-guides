Great Library entry.
In the 20th and 21st century life support systems consumed most of the resources available on space stations and colonies. Space colonization therefore depended on maximizing the use of robots. Colonization architects insisted on developing primitive assembly bays used by shipping companies on Earth to handle more complex tasks in space. These docks accomplished the task of reducing the number of workers, but better assembly bays were needed to reduce accidents and aid humans in conquering the final frontier.
