# Spaceship Factory (Civ5)

Game Info.
Advanced production building. Requires [Factory%20%28Civ5%29](Factory).
Strategy.
The Spaceship Factory is a very late-game building, designed to give you an edge in the space race. It does provide a minor boost to your city, but at this point this effect is negligible and hardly worth the resource the building consumes.
The bonus for constructing Spaceship parts is its main effect, reducing the time needed to complete a part to roughly two-thirds. This may be especially useful when you're scrambling to complete your Spaceship a turn ahead of your competition.
