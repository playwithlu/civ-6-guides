# Mary Leakey (Civ6)

Mary Leakey is an [Great%20Scientist%20%28Civ6%29](Great Scientist) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Unique ability.
Gain 350 for every [Artifact%20%28Civ6%29](Artifact) in this [City%20%28Civ6%29](city). Artifacts in all your cities generate 300% of their normal .
Strategy.
Naturally, Mary Leakey is best used in an [Archaeological%20Museum%20%28Civ6%29](Archaeological Museum) with three Artifacts present. Be sure to [Theming%20bonus%20%28Civ6%29](theme) your Museums afterward to get the most out of the boost.
In [vanilla](vanilla) "Civilization VI" and "", [English%20%28Civ6%29](England) should prioritize Leakey since their Archaeological Museums have six slots.
Another Atomic Era Great Scientist, [Erwin%20Schr%C3%B6dinger%20%28Civ6%29](Erwin Schrödinger), provides three s from the Atomic or [Information%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Information Era). The least expensive [Technology%20%28Civ6%29](technologies) from the Atomic Era cost 1065 , so Schrödinger provides at least 1278 (3 * 1065 * 0.4) . Since Leakey provides at most 1050 , she generally should not be chosen over Schrödinger except when playing as England in vanilla "Civilization VI" or "Rise and Fall", or when you stand to benefit from the bonus.
