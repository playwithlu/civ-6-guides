# Buddhism (Civ6)

Buddhism is one of the twelve default [Religion%20%28Civ6%29](religions) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". Players who have founded a [Pantheons%20%28Civ6%29](pantheon) can found Buddhism by using a [Great%20Prophet%20%28Civ6%29](Great Prophet) at either a [Holy%20Site%20%28Civ6%29](Holy Site) or [Stonehenge%20%28Civ6%29](Stonehenge).
Buddhist places of worship are represented in-game by the [Pagoda%20%28Civ6%29](Pagoda), the [Wat%20%28Civ6%29](Wat), and the [Stupa%20%28Civ6%29](Stupa), though there is no real gameplay relation between the religion and the [Building%20%28Civ6%29](buildings).
