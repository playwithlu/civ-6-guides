# Epic Work Projects (Civ3)/Civilopedia

The Wonders of the World did not fall out of the sky. The great pyramids of Egypt, the
Gardens of Babylon and the Temple of Artemis were not built on inspiration alone. They
were built on the toil of thousands, those bare-chested lines of sweating slaves
that "heaved" and "ho'd" every mammoth stone out of ancient quarries from Egypt
to Mesopotamia. Those souls that baked under the relentless sun formed a body of
ancient masonry and craftsmanship that stands, to this day, as a testament to the power
and will of ancient man.
