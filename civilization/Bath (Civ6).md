# Bath (Civ6)

The Bath is a unique of the [Roman%20%28Civ6%29](Roman) [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It replaces the [Aqueduct%20%28Civ6%29](Aqueduct) and must be built adjacent to both the [City%20Center%20%28Civ6%29](City Center) and a [River%20%28Civ6%29](River), [Lake%20%28Civ6%29](Lake), [Oasis%20%28Civ6%29](Oasis), or [Mountains%20%28Civ6%29](Mountain).
Strategy.
The extra 2 , 1 , and lower cost of the Bath provide a great advantage growing larger cities before the [Sewer%20%28Civ6%29](Sewer) and [Neighborhood%20%28Civ6%29](Neighborhood) are available. That means Roman cities with a Bath can support 2 more Citizens than those of other civilizations with an Aqueduct. It's wise to found cities near sources of fresh water and build the Bath when it becomes available, or at least place it soon to avoid the increase in cost over time. When combined with Rome's and [Trajan%20%28Civ6%29](Trajan's) [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](unique abilities) and the [Legion%20%28Civ6%29](Legion), the Bath allows the Romans to claim more [Territory%20%28Civ6%29](territory) and build larger cities more quickly and safely than other civs.
