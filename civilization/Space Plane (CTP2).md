In 2047, scientists at the National Aeronautical and Space Administration launched the first orbital transport vehicle. Primarily envisioned as a commercial and industrial cargo and transport craft, it was designed to launch into orbit and touch down within a few days. Based on many of the design principles of the space shuttle, the Space Plane employed advanced composites to shield it against the friction and intense heat of atmospheric breach and fuel cell technology to propel its giant rocket engines.
