# Apadana (Civ6)

The Apadana is a in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It must be built adjacent to a civilization's .
Strategy.
Anyone looking to build a large number of Wonders or wanting to enjoy the bonuses of [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-states) need look no further than here! The Apadana is a monster of generation, providing +2 s when it is built and 2 more s whenever any other wonder is built in the same city. Try to build as many Wonders as you can in the same city as the Apadana to maximize s. Civs that are good at Wonder-building such as [Chinese%20%28Civ6%29](China), [French%20%28Civ6%29](France), and [Egyptian%20%28Civ6%29](Egypt) will especially reap the benefits! Alternatively, [Pericles%20%28Civ6%29](Pericles) may desire to build this Wonder due to his bonus for being the [Suzerain%20%28Civ6%29](Suzerain) of city-states. But do be careful - since it must be built adjacent to the 's [City%20Center%20%28Civ6%29](City Center), only six tiles at most will be eligible to construct it.
The two slots for any [Great%20Work%20%28Civ6%29](Great Work) can help anyone who finds themselves short of slots to put specific Great Works in.
Note that the Apadana does not grant s for Wonders already built in the same city before it is completed.
