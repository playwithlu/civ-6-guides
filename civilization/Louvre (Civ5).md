# Louvre (Civ5)

Game Info.
Requires [Exploration%20%28Civ5%29](Exploration). ({{BNW}})
Strategy.
The Louvre is an important wonder for culture-oriented empires. Thanks to its 4 Great Work slots, it has the most powerful theming bonus, which is not difficult to fulfill at that! It often requires trading Great Works or taking some by force, though. A must for a player seeking a [Cultural%20victory%20%28Civ5%29](cultural victory); remember, however, to unlock the Exploration tree.
[French%20%28Civ5%29](France) can benefit greatly from this, as {{Tourism5}} bonuses are doubled in its {{Capital5}}, meaning that they can get a full +16 {{Tourism5}} bonus from this wonder.
