The discovery of reliable methods for agriculture marked a major turning point in human evolution. Animal husbandry and breeding increased the strength, supply and utility of livestock. Early farming methods were subject to the whims of nature, as deviations in seasons and weather patterns could decrease the yield of, or simply wipe out, crops. Early farmers would farm single pieces of land until fallow, which contributed to long periods of scarcity. Although starvation was a constant threat, granaries enabled communities to store food through winters, droughts and fallow periods. Regardless of the risks, farming prompted many cultures to abandon nomadic life and settle in one place. Grassy lands near major water sources proved ideal.
