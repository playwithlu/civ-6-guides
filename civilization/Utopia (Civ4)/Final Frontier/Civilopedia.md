# Utopia (Civ4)/Final Frontier/Civilopedia

Before the rise of Utilitarianism, the galactic labor market was often a bleak place. Men and women were forced to perform unending hours of backbreaking labor in order to compete with the tireless machines that had now become so prevalent. It would take the actions of a single hammer-bearer at a stone mile marker facility, Easla Ve, to finally bring about a change for the average human worker. Tired of endlessly "crunching" for milestones with little chance to develop a life for herself, Ve struck out for infinity with a small enclave of her fellow "Crunchers."
Hoping to build a society where human life was more important than output, Ve created the first Utopian Labor system, allowing workers to take their time and make certain that their lives outside their work was not neglected. This small, nurturing society eventually spun into a galaxy-wide movement, unconcerned with the never-ending rigors of commerce and production.
