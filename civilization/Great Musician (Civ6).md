Strategy.
Great Musicians are very valuable to players pursuing a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Cultural Victory), though this value becomes apparent later than the other -oriented . [Wonder%20%28Civ6%29](Wonders) and [Building%20%28Civ6%29](buildings) with slots for Great Works of Music do not become available until the [Industrial%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Industrial Era) (with the exceptions of the [Palace%20%28Civ6%29](Palace), [Apadana%20%28Civ6%29](Apadana), a [Bank%20%28Civ6%29](Bank) built by [Giovanni%20de%27%20Medici%20%28Civ6%29](Giovanni de' Medici), and the [Queen%27s%20Bibliotheque%20%28Civ6%29](Queen's Bibliotheque) of [Kristina%20%28Civ6%29](Kristina), all of which can hold Great Works of any kind), and there are only three of them: the [Bolshoi%20Theatre%20%28Civ6%29](Bolshoi Theatre), [Broadway%20%28Civ6%29](Broadway), and the [Sydney%20Opera%20House%20%28Civ6%29](Sydney Opera House). Apart from these, the [Broadcast%20Center%20%28Civ6%29](Broadcast Center) is the only regular building that can hold Great Works of Music. However, if you can attract enough Great Musicians to fill these wonders and all of your Broadcast Centers with Great Works of Music, the [Satellite%20Broadcasts%20%28Civ6%29](Satellite Broadcasts) [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](policy card) will reward you with a huge output of . Other [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) will have had plenty of time to build up their defense by the time Great Musicians and Great Works of Music come into play, so this policy card helps tremendously in counteracting the lateness of their effects.
