# Acropolis (Civ6)/Civilopedia

In ancient Greece, acropolis meant, quite literally, "upper city." And in Athens, Corinth, Argos, Thebes, and elsewhere, that's exactly what it was â€“ a portion of the town built upon an elevated area, often a hill with steep slopes, that was eminently defensible. Should the outer walls fall to invaders, a final stand could be made in the acropolis. In time, in many places, the old acropolis became the nucleus of a sprawling new city. During the Archaic Period in Greece, as the cities grew and the threat of barbarians lessened, these old upper districts underwent urban renewal, with temples, theaters, forums, palaces, government buildings and the like replacing the humble houses, markets, barracks and squares that once occupied the summit.
