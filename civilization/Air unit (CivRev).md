# Air unit (CivRev)

An air unit, as its name implies, is a [List%20of%20units%20in%20CivRev](unit) that fights in the air. There are only two kinds of air units: [Fighter%20%28CivRev%29](Fighters) and [Bomber%20%28CivRev%29](Bombers).
Air units can move over any type of terrain and can only be attacked by other air units. Unlike [Ground%20unit%20%28CivRev%29](ground units) and [Naval%20unit%20%28CivRev%29](naval units), however, they require fuel to operate. They must return to a friendly [City%20%28CivRev%29](city) to refuel every few turns, or they will crash and be destroyed.
[Army%20%28CivRev%29](Armies) of air units are referred to as "Wings." Once they are formed, they cannot be split up.
