# Viking (civic) (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Most historian-linguists now associate the term “Viking” with the Norse vikingr, meaning “pirate.” But not in the sense that most would assume; rather, to go a-Viking simply meant to undertake any overseas expedition, not just for raiding, although there was certainly that angle, but for exploration, trade, or mercenary service.
