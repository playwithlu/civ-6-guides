# Earth Goddess (Civ6)

Earth Goddess is a [Pantheons%20%28Civ6%29](Pantheon) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It adds 1 to all [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles) owned by the player that have Charming or Breathtaking [Appeal%20%28Civ6%29](Appeal). In "", it was altered to add 1 to all tiles owned by the player that have Breathtaking Appeal only.
Strategy.
Earth Goddess is a helpful pantheon for [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) that settle lots of [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) near [Woods%20%28Civ6%29](Woods), [Mountains%20%28Civ6%29](Mountains), or [Coastal%20%28Civ6%29](along the coast). It has strong synergy with the civ abilities of [Brazilian%20%28Civ6%29](Brazil) (whose [Rainforest%20%28Civ6%29](Rainforests) have higher Appeal than usual), the [Incan%20%28Civ6%29](Inca) (whose mountains are workable and always have Breathtaking Appeal), and the [M%C4%81ori%20%28Civ6%29](MƒÅori) (whose Woods will also provide bonus as long as they remain unimproved). Civilizations whose unique [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](tile improvements) provide Appeal bonuses can also benefit greatly from this pantheon by using their unique infrastructure to manipulate the Appeal of tiles (with [Egyptian%20%28Civ6%29](Egypt's) [Sphinx%20%28Civ6%29](Sphinx) in "Gathering Storm" being the best with a +2 Appeal bonus). Later in the game, building the [Eiffel%20Tower%20%28Civ6%29](Eiffel Tower) will provide the founder of this pantheon with an empire-wide boost in Appeal (and in all likelihood, a corresponding boost in output).
While this pantheon is most useful to players pursuing a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Religion](Religious Victory), [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Cultural Victory) seekers can make use of the to patronize or purchase [Naturalist%20%28Civ6%29](Naturalists) and [Rock%20Band%20%28Civ6%29](Rock Bands). This is particularly pertinent to [Teddy%20Roosevelt%20%28Civ6%29/Bull%20Moose](Bull Moose Teddy Roosevelt), a Cultural Victory master with a great incentive to work Breathtaking tiles and buy as many Naturalists as possible. He should choose this pantheon whenever possible.
