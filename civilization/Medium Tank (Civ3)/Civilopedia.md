# Medium Tank (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Generally speaking, compared to a light tank, a medium tank had thicker armor and a
larger gun. While this translated into better survivability and more firepower, it also meant that the medium
tank was usually slower and more prone to bog in soft ground than a light tank. Too, because of their greater
size and weight, less medium tanks than light tanks could be transported aboard amphibious landing ships in
the same amount of space. Nevertheless, both sides found used quantities of medium tanks in the Pacific theatre
during WWII. The ubiquitous Sherman tank (75mm to 105mm main gun) was the mainstay of the Allies, while the most
common Japanese medium tank was the Type 89 "Chi-Ro" (57mm main armament).
