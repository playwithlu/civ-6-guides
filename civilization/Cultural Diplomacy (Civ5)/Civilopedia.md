# Cultural Diplomacy (Civ5)/Civilopedia

Cultural Diplomacy is the policy of lending out a civilization's most beautiful and treasured items to other civilizations in order to promote peace and understanding between all people. One of the most enduring forms of cultural diplomacy is the World's Fair, also known as the Universal Exposition, which is held in a different city every two to five years. The World's Fair features samples of many nations' arts, crafts, agriculture, and industry. The first World's Fair was held in 1851 in the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park, London. It was the brainchild of Prince Albert, husband to Queen Victoria. There were some 13,000 exhibits in total, seen by some six million people. The next World's Fair is scheduled to run in Shanghai, China in 2010. Some 70 million visitors are expected.
