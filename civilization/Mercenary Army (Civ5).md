# Mercenary Army (Civ5)

Mercenary Army is a [Social%20policies%20%28Civ5%29](social policy) in "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)". It was added in "[Brave%20New%20World](Brave New World)". It is part of the [Commerce%20%28Civ5%29](Commerce) tree.
Throughout the Ages various countries have found use for Mercenaries - those soldiers of fortune who are ready to give their lives for the highest bidder. But an empire which chooses to really invest in Mercenaries gains access to their finest warriors. And, interestingly enough, all commerce-oriented empires find Mercenaries to be extremely useful. 
Strategy.
The [Landsknecht%20%28Civ5%29](Landsknecht) is a very interesting unit, if you're in the [Medieval%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Medieval) or [Renaissance%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Renaissance Era). It provides a cheaper alternative to the [Pikeman%20%28Civ5%29](Pikeman), who also has some interesting harassing abilities. From a strategic point of view, though, you don't really need this Policy, but for the fact that it allows access to higher-level ones. 
So, always choose the other starting Policy, [Wagon%20Trains%20%28Civ5%29](Wagon Trains), unless you're at war and intend to make use of the new unit right away.
