# Wormhole Probe (CTP1)

The Wormhole Probe is a [List%20of%20units%20in%20CTP1](unit) in "".
Summary.
Using phase-matter technology and nanite-engineering, the Wormhole Probe provides the first possibility for leaving [Space%20%28CTP1%29](space) and entering hereto unexplored dimensions through the elusive [Wormhole%20%28CTP1%29](wormhole). Its mission is to seek out and retrieve genetic proof of alien existence by entering a Wormhole.
Great Library entry.
From alien archeological discoveries and theories of phase-matter 23rd century scientists proved the existence of a Wormhole in high-Earth orbit. But without additional work no one could enter a Wormhole measuring less than an electron in width. The Probe solved this, creating a fold in space-time. The Probe occupied a mere point in our four dimensional view of space-time thereby allowing it to enter the Wormhole.
