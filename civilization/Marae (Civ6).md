# Marae (Civ6)

The Marae is a [Unique%20building%20%28Civ6%29](unique) [Buildings%20%28Civ6%29](building) of the [M%C4%81ori%20%28Civ6%29](Māori) [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) in "". It is built in the [Theater%20Square%20%28Civ6%29](Theater Square) [District%20%28Civ6%29](district) and replaces the [Amphitheater%20%28Civ6%29](Amphitheater).
Strategy.
As the Māori, be sure to build a Theater Square in every city with passable features: [Woods%20%28Civ6%29](Woods), [Rainforest%20%28Civ6%29](Rainforests), [Marsh%20%28Civ6%29](Marshes), [Oasis%20%28Civ6%29](Oases), [Reef%20%28Civ6%29](Reefs), [Geothermal%20Fissure%20%28Civ6%29](Geothermal Fissures), [Floodplains%20%28Civ6%29](Floodplains), [Volcanic%20Soil%20%28Civ6%29](Volcanic Soil), and passable [Natural%20wonder%20%28Civ6%29](natural wonders). Keep this in mind when settling your first city because you can get excellent yields this way early in the game.
The Māori are all but guaranteed to settle near the [Coast%20%28Civ6%29](Coast), providing an opportunity to take advantage of the bonus from Reef tiles. Their bonus from unimproved Woods and Rainforest tiles stacks with the Marae's bonuses, and if you settle near Floodplains and [Volcano%20%28Civ6%29](Volcanoes), [Flood%20%28Civ6%29](floods) and Volcanic Soil (from volcanic eruptions) will provide even richer yields from the surrounding terrain. Geothermal Fissures are especially profitable, as they will yield , , and as well as , , and clean after you research [Synthetic%20Materials%20%28Civ6%29](Synthetic Materials) and improve them with [Geothermal%20Plant%20%28Civ6%29](Geothermal Plants).
After unlocking Flight, you will earn for all of the aforementioned features (and unpassable features like [Ice%20%28Civ6%29](Ice) as well). Most importantly, after unlocking [Conservation%20%28Civ6%29](Conservation), your Builders have the ability to plant Woods, so make sure you cover all the virgin lands with this to further amplify your late game potential.
