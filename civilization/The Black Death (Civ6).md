# The Black Death (Civ6)

The Black Death is a [List%20of%20scenarios%20in%20Civ6](scenario) in "".
Intro.
The Black Death ravaged Europe and Western Asia in the mid-14th century, killing a greater share of the population than any other event in world history. The pandemic killed millions, ruined economies, upended political dynasties and transformed the face of the Western world.
Your task is to lead your nation through the calamity: keep your population alive, your economy strong, and your faith unshaken amidst a world of terror and desperation.
Gameplay.
The scenario is set in the medieval times during the Black Death. There is a [multiplayer](multiplayer) mode in this scenario. The scenario can be won by researching the final [Technology%20%28Civ6%29](technology), [Invention%20%28technology%29%20%28Civ6%29](Invention), or the final [Civic%20%28Civ6%29](civic), [The%20Middle%20Class%20%28Civ6%29](The Middle Class), before 85 turns have passed.
In The Black Death, a plague regularly sweeps over the continent, originating from port [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) of different nations. If a [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](unit) ends its turn on a [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tile) with the plague, it loses 20 [HP](HP). Cities with plague also have a high risk of losing Population.
By default, plague-stricken tiles cannot be worked, which makes cities lose a lot more of their Population and yields. The player is also regularly presented with events where one must usually choose between two bad choices, which usually have to do with cities losing yields.
Strategy.
You should focus on either producing enough or to research either the final technology or civic. While you may be tempted to attack neighboring nations if they are weakened by the plague, it is very difficult to keep your armies alive while the plague is spreading, and additionally it's difficult to produce more units with your cities crippled by the plague. So build either [Campus%20%28Civ6%29](Campuses) or [Theater%20Square%20%28Civ6%29](Theater Squares) early on while it is still possible - remember that cities with too few Citizens cannot build new s. Fast units (namely, [Knight%20%28Civ6%29](Knights)) are, however, useful in pillaging enemy districts and improvements, as pillaging Campuses yields , pillaging Theater Squares yields , and pillaging [Farm%20%28Civ6%29](Farms) yields HP. Also, by using a [Caravel%20%28Civ6%29](Caravel), you can pillage each [Coastal%20%28Civ6%29](coastal) city's [Harbor%20%28Civ6%29](Harbor) and get an impressive amount of . And while on the subject of combat, note that in this scenario [Encampment%20%28Civ6%29](Encampments) and [City%20Center%20%28Civ6%29](City Centers) cannot perform ranged attacks. Finally, as the yields of your cities will inevitably be crippled in the course of the scenario, you should be prepared to acquire your new units and [Building%20%28Civ6%29](buildings) by some other means: either purchase them with or by , so be sure to keep a stockpile of one (or both).
