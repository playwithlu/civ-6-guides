Great Library entry.
From the beginning of kingdoms, the capitol has served as fortress, treasury, and home for the ruler. Khorsabad, the capital of Sargon Il in the seventh Century BC covered one square mile enclosed in a double fortification wall. The towering palace included three private temples, a small ziggurat, and a protective arsenal. From such a capitol, rulers could impress both subjects and foes, protecting themselves from riot, invasion, and starvation.
