# Advanced Tactics (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Napoleon once said that, "An army's effectiveness depends on its size, training, experience, and
morale, and morale is worth more than any of the other factors combined." Soldiers of the Napoleonic
Era were some of the most highly trained and mentally disciplined in the world. The French
Imperial Guard, for example, is credited with winning many of Napoleon's
battles. And elite troops were not exclusive to the French Army. The British
Lifeguard and the Russian Guard, and even the Ottoman
Janissary could hold their own on the Napoleonic field of battle.
