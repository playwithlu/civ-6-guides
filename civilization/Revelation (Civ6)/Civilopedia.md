# Revelation (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Religiously speaking, revelation is the revealing of some form of truth or knowledge through direct communication with a deity or other supernatural entity through various means – burning bushes, graven tablets, voices from statues, drug-induced dreams, and the list continues. Virtually every prophet from Moses to Mohammed to Joseph Smith has claimed the revelation to them personally of holy writ. Whether confabulation or fact, there is no denying that divine revelations have shaped civilization throughout the millennia. Recent scientific studies by Stanley Koren have sought to understand the phenomenon through the use of the “God helmet,” a device for stimulating the temporal lobes … perhaps soon everyone can have revelations.
