# Great Library (Civ5)

Strategy.
The Great Library is a scientific wonder that provides useful bonuses early on. It is arguably the best wonder in the entire game. First, its effect to grant 1 free technology on top of providing a free [Library%20%28Civ5%29](Library) is proven to be extremely useful, especially in the Ancient Era. Second, its overall boost to (along with the free Library and Great Scientist point) may prove invaluable to your early game tech progression. Finally, starting in "", it provides two free slots for [Great%20Work%20%28Civ5%29](Great Works of Writing), which are exceptionally useful for the race that starts in the mid-game.
If you want to have a good chance of finishing the Great Library, it's recommended to start building it as soon as possible. Unless pursuing an early rush, you're highly recommended when playing on Prince [Difficulty%20level%20%28Civ5%29](difficulty) or below. However, it's not always recommended to build this wonder as it'll slow down your early-game expansion. With the boosts that the [AI](AI) receives on King difficulty and above, they may easily build it ahead of you, especially if you have poor . If you plan on building it, your starting research order should be [Pottery%20%28Civ5%29](Pottery) first and [Writing%20%28Civ5%29](Writing) second, or you risk being outraced by the others.
Like many wonders that provide free buildings, if you're building the Great Library, do so before you build the normal Library.
