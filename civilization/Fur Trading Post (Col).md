# Fur Trading Post (Col)

A Fur trading post in a colony increases the output of coats from [Furs%20%28Col%29](furs) by any [Master%20Fur%20Traders%20%28Col%29](traders). The colony must have a population of at least 4 to begin construction of a fur trading post. It can be upgraded to a [Fur%20factory%20%28Col%29](Fur factory).
