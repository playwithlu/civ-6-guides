Strategy.
Between the two unique units of Hungary when led by [Matthias%20Corvinus%20%28Civ6%29](Matthias Corvinus), the Husz치r is harder to utilize effectively, since you cannot control if your opponents will like you enough to form [Alliance](Alliances) with you, especially in single player games when your conquests can start as early as the [Classical%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Classical Era) right after [Swordsman%20%28Civ6%29](Swordsmen) are unlocked. Its only major upside, despite having very limited synergy with Hungary as a domination powerhouse, is that it has 3 extra Combat Strength compared to a standard [Cavalry%20%28Civ6%29](Cavalry) at a negligible cost increase. If you are able to get someone to declare friendship with you before your warmongering starts and appease them enough to establish an alliance with you when the [Industrial%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Industrial Era) comes, the Husz치r's bonus might be somewhat more noticeable; otherwise, this unit is rather unremarkable, with its bonus too rarely applicable to be significant.
