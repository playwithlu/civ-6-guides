# Burial Mound (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Since prehistoric times man has used burial mounds of varying proportions and construction to inter the final
remains of vaunted leaders. In fact, according to some anthropologists, one of the first true signs of the human
imagination at work is the burial mound, as it provides the first evidence of manâ€™s becoming aware of the
possible existence of an afterlife.
