He leads the [Arabian%20%28Civ6%29](Arabs) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Often science and faith don't mix, but for Arabia they sure do.
This is the standard version of Saladin when players do not have the [Great%20Negotiators%20Pack%20%28Civ6%29](Great Negotiators Pack) enabled. When it is enabled, Saladin will be split into two alternate [Persona%20%28Civ6%29](personas): [Saladin%20%28Civ6%29/Sultan](Sultan Saladin), with a new appearance and abilities; and Vizier Saladin, using his former model and abilities.
Intro.
 The marriage of science and religion is a delicate balancing act, but one that you have mastered, Saladin. Your quest for knowledge is noble, and your people have a deep respect for you. But you need not rush into the unknown. Given time, the answers to life's most puzzling questions will find their way back to Arabia.
In-Game.
Saladin's unique [Agenda%20%28Civ6%29](agenda) is Ayyubid Dynasty. He likes leaders with his worship [Building%20%28Civ6%29](building), and dislikes leaders who follow other [Religion%20%28Civ6%29](Religions) or wage war on followers of his Religion.
His [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader ability) is Righteousness of the Faith. It lowers the cost of his worship building and allows it to provide bonus , , and .
Detailed Approach.
Arabia is a religious civ that doesn't have to worry about racing to beat the other players to [Great%20Prophet%20%28Civ6%29](Great Prophets); they can just let a Religion come to them. Once they have established their Religion, then they can quickly move forward on a number of fronts. They will spread their Religion to as many cities as possible to boost their output, and add a [Holy%20Site%20%28Civ6%29](Holy Site) to most of their [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) to allow them to then add their worship building (which boosts overall city output of , , and ). Their worship buildings are inexpensive for other civilizations to add, too: a smart move for Arabia's neighbors to keep Saladin's wrath at bay.
