# Naples (Civ5)/Civilopedia

Dating back to the 9th Century BC, founded as a Greek colony, Naples is one of the oldest continuously-inhabited cities in the world. The city eventually became part of the Roman Republic, then Empire. A microcosm of Europe, the city has witnessed the coming and going of many occupiers, each leaving traces of its culture and bloodlines. From 1282 through 1816 AD, it was the center of the rich and vibrant Kingdom of Naples, a prominent player in the struggles of the great nations of the time. It was occupied in turn by the French, the Spanish, the Austrians, again by the Spanish, and yet again by the French before gaining its independence at the end of the Napoleonic Wars. In 1815 it was combined with Sicily in the Congress of Vienna to form the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, which survived until the unification of Italy in 1861. The city's 2800-year history has left it a wealth of great art, architecture, and commerce, making it one of the most important cities of the Mediterranean.
