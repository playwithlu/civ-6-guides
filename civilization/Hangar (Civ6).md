# Hangar (Civ6)

The Hangar is a basic aerial [Building%20%28Civ6%29](building) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is built in the [Aerodrome%20%28Civ6%29](Aerodrome) [District%20%28Civ6%29](district) (or one of its replacements).
Strategy.
In addition to a small boost, the Hangar increases its Aerodrome's [Air%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](air unit) capacity and provides all such [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](units) built there with bonus [XP](XP). It is wise to build it in perimeter [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) or those that you intend to turn into air bases.
