# Treasury

A [Civilizations](civilization)'s treasury contains the [Gold%20%28currency%29](currency) collected from taxes and other sources during play. Each [turn](turn), surplus gold not required for [maintenance](maintenance) costs is added to the treasury. This money is then available for the player's discretionary spending, such as hurrying [city](city) [production](production), trading in [diplomacy](diplomacy), and conducting [espionage](espionage). In games that feature [random%20event](random event)s, options may require money from the treasury to select.
In certain games, capturing a city loots a portion of the enemy treasury proportionate to the city [Population](size) and total reserves.
A civilization can conduct deficit spending, but cannot incur a national debt. If expenses exceed gross income, the difference is deducted from the treasury's reserve; if maintenance costs exceed the treasury's available funds, [city%20improvement](city improvement)s will be sold off to generate liquidity and/or [unit](unit)s [disband](disband)ed to reduce expenses, depending on the particular game mechanics. In certain games, the [advisor](advisor) will warn when the treasury is in danger of depletion.
Most standard games begin with no gold in the treasury, although easier [difficulty%20level](difficulty level)s may provide the human player with bonus funds.
A few games feature an [Economic%20Victory](Economic Victory), which requires a certain minimum reserve in the treasury.
