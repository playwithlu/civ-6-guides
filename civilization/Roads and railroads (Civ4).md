# Roads and railroads (Civ4)

Roads and railroads allow [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ4](units) to move longer distances within a turn by reducing the [Movement%20%28Civ4%29](movement) costs of [Terrain%20%28Civ4%29](terrain).
When a unit is within hostile [Culture%20%28Civ4%29](cultural) [Borders%20%28Civ4%29](borders), roads and railroads have no effect unless the unit has the [Commando%20%28Civ4%29](Commando) [Promotion%20%28Civ4%29](promotion). When the [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ4](civilization) has an [Open%20Borders%20%28Civ4%29](Open Borders) agreement allowing their units right of passage, they may freely take advantage of roads and railroads.
Roads.
Roads can be built after discovering [The%20Wheel%20%28Civ4%29](The Wheel). With roads, all spaces cost 1/2 movement points (MP) to enter from other road [Tile%20%28Civ4%29](tiles). After discovering [Engineering%20%28Civ4%29](Engineering), the cost goes down to 1/3 MP . In practice, this means that a unit with just one movement point can move three tiles using roads. Similarly, units with two movement points can move six tiles.
Railroads.
To build railroads, the civilization first needs to discover the [Railroad%20%28Civ4%29](Railroad) [List%20of%20technologies%20in%20Civ4](technology) and have an access to [Coal%20%28Civ4%29](Coal) or [Oil%20%28Civ4%29](Oil). Railroads are similar to roads, but they reduce the number of movement points needed to enter a tile from another railroad tile to 1/10 MP .
Railroads also give a bonus of 1 to tiles with a [Mine%20%28Civ4%29](Mine), a [Lumbermill%20%28Civ4%29](Lumbermill), or a [Quarry%20%28Civ4%29](Quarry).
