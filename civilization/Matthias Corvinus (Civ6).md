Matthias I (23 February 1443 – 6 April 1490), better known as Matthias Corvinus, was  and  from 1458 until his death. He is known for his creation of the , considered one of Europe's first professional standing armies, as well as for his patronage of scholarship, and art, being the first non-Italian ruler to embrace the style. He leads the [Hungarian%20%28Civ6%29](Hungarians) in "".
Matthias Corvinus uses the flowing [Rivers%20%28Civ6%29](rivers) near his [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) to recruit cavalry and [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-states) in his quest for domination.
In-Game.
Matthias Corvinus's unique [Agenda%20%28Civ6%29](agenda) is Raven Banner. He often levies [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](units) from city-states and likes leaders who do the same. He dislikes leaders who shun mercenaries.
His [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader ability) is Raven King. He gains 2 {{Envoy6}}s with a city-state when he levies units from it, and levied units receive +2 {{Movement6}} and +5 {{Strength6}} Combat Strength and can be upgraded at 25% of the normal [Resource%20%28Civ6%29](resource) and {{Gold6}} costs. It also allows him to produce the [Black%20Army%20%28Civ6%29](Black Army), a [Unique%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](unique unit) that replaces the [Courser%20%28Civ6%29](Courser), is unlocked with [Castles%20%28Civ6%29](Castles), and gains +3 {{Strength6}} Combat Strength for each adjacent levied unit.
Detailed Approach.
Hungary gains {{Production6}} towards {{District6}}s and [Building%20%28Civ6%29](buildings) in districts directly across a River from their [City%20Center%20%28Civ6%29](City Centers). This aids them in developing cities rapidly so that they can spend more time producing military units. Matthias Corvinus gets two unique Cavalry units. The Black Army upgrades into their second unique unit, the [Husz%C3%A1r%20%28Civ6%29](Huszár), allowing them to dominate with their powerful military for a long period of the game. Matthias Corvinus' ability towards leveraging City-States gives Hungary's conquest extra units that help on the path towards victory. The [Thermal%20Bath%20%28Civ6%29](Thermal Bath) helps maintain the conquered cities by providing {{Amenities6}} and preventing revolt.
