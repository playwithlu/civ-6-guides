# Lighthouse (Civ5)

Game Info.
Bonus sea building. Can only be constructed in [Coastal%20%28Civ5%29](coastal) [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities).
Strategy.
The Lighthouse is the first specialized sea building, considerably improving the output of coastal cities. Oftentimes those cities have problems growing because of limited access to (usually when they're built on islands). Construct a Lighthouse in them ASAP, especially if there are resources nearby. The effect of a Lighthouse on improved resources turns them into veritable "food pumps" very early in the game.
Note that the [Great%20Lighthouse%20%28Civ5%29](Great Lighthouse) provides a free Lighthouse building. If you plan on constructing this [List%20of%20wonders%20in%20Civ5](wonder) in one of your cities, don't bother building a Lighthouse there!
