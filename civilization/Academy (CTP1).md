By the fifth century BC, Athens had many small academies where boys learned to write on wax tablets with pointed styluses and to read from rolls of papyrus. Arithmetic was taught with the abacus and rhetoric was taught through dialogues with teachers. Teachers like Socrates, who inspired both Plato and Aristotle, set the intellectual foundations for two thousand years of European thought.
