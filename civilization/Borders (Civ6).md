# Borders (Civ6)

Borders of your [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) grow as accumulates. Borders also offer full [Sight%20%28Civ6%29](visibility) of adjacent [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles).
City Borders.
Upon founding a new [City%20%28Civ6%29](city), all tiles around the [City%20Center%20%28Civ6%29](City Center) are claimed, plus additional tiles extending outward. For [Russian%20%28Civ6%29](Russia), their [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](civilization ability) greatly amplifies this effect. Note that it can't claim tiles of another civilization.
Cities will gradually claim additional tiles as is accrued. Additionally, individual tiles can be purchased for (up to three [hex](hex)es away from City Center).
Border Rules.
Initially, borders will be open and weakly defined, enabling [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](units) from other civilizations and [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-states) to enter. Once the [Early%20Empire%20%28Civ6%29](Early Empire) [Civic%20%28Civ6%29](civic) is researched, borders will switch to closed. Unless an Open Borders agreement is made, attempting to enter closed borders constitutes an act of war. For city-states, Open Borders is granted to players that have reached [Suzerain%20%28Civ6%29](Suzerain) status or slotted the [Gunboat%20Diplomacy%20%28Civ6%29](Gunboat Diplomacy) [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](policy card). [Jo%C3%A3o%20III%20%28Civ6%29](Jo√£o III) also has Open Borders with all city-states due to his leader ability.
Note that [Trader%20%28Civ6%29](Traders) and [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Religious](religious units) are exempt from these rules, and may pass into closed borders. This means [Missionary%20%28Civ6%29](Missionaries) and [Apostle%20%28Civ6%29](Apostles) can be used to perform reconnaissance in foreign lands. Additionally, the [Terracotta%20Army%20%28Civ6%29](Terracotta Army) [Wonder%20%28Civ6%29](wonder) grants [Archaeologist%20%28Civ6%29](Archaeologists) the ability to enter closed borders.
