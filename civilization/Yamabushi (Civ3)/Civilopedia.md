# Yamabushi (Civ3)/Civilopedia

The word "yamabushi" literally means "mountain warrior", but the
Yamabushi of feudal Japan were warrior monks whose ethos focused on
nature. They did not worship nature but incorporated it into their
practices at a fundamental level. Yamabushi often used the dangers of
nature to become more self-aware, exposing themselves to the elements
and extreme weather conditions so as to "purify" themselves, master
their environments, and experience being alive in the most direct
possible way. Today, yamabushi monks do not emphasize the martial arts
as they did during the Sengoku Jidai, but many traditional Japanese
martial arts such as judo and jujitsu were developed and mastered by
yamabushi.
