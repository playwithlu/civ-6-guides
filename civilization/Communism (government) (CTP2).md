Although communal living and popular government were concepts that originated in ancient times, the socio-economic injustices of Western Europe's Industrial Revolution-era class structure spawned the first earnest political movement aimed at establishing a communist state. In 1848, a Prussian sociologist and economist named Karl Marx penned, with Friedrich Engels, The Communist Manifesto, a pamphlet outlining a plan to radically alter the government of labor, markets and the state. Marx also wrote the communist movement's most important book, Das Kapital. Although communism has had many developments, the fundamental idea of a society in which property was owned by the community and all citizens shared in the enjoyment of the common wealth according to their need.
Historically, communism had a hard time taking hold. The Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, lead by Vladmir Lenin, began the transformation of Russia into a communist state. Although the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) lasted well into the 1990s, its success as a communist state was mixed. Plagued by a host of problems both internal and external, the people of the USSR endured a series of dictatorships unrivaled in their oppressiveness. After more than 70 years of attempts to establish a viable state, the communists lost power to more capitalist-minded leaders. Smaller nations have experimented with communism throughout the 20th century, but capitalist nations, most notably the United States, succeeded in subverting and dismantling almost every attempt to establish a communist government.
