# Mosque (Civ5)

Game Info.
Religious building. Can only be built in cities following a religion with the [Religion%20%28Civ5%29%23Follower%20Beliefs](Mosques) belief. Can only be purchased with {{Faith5}}.
Strategy.
Mosques are considered the most effective religious buildings at generating {{Faith5}}. They boost more {{Faith5}} than all other religious buildings, at the expense of a lower {{Happiness5}} bonus.
Note that you can only purchase a Mosque in one of your own cities in which your faith is the majority (i.e. it has your religious symbol to the right of its name).
