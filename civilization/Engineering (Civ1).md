Civilopedia entry.
The science of Engineering originated with the civil engineers, who built bridges, roads, aqueducts, and other structures, and the military engineers, who built fortifications and weapons. Over time, Engineering came to mean the design, Construction, and operation of the structures and machines of industry, warfare, and day-to-day life. Engineers were the people who put the new advances of knowledge to practical use. They were people not only good with their hands, but also with their heads. The Engineering problem-solver was most likely to discover a new Invention and lead the advance of knowledge.
