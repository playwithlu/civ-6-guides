Strategy.
Traditionally, cities have been built along rivers, and for good reason. Rivers provide a steady source of [Fresh%20water%20%28Civ5%29](fresh water) for both drinking and irrigation, improving the farmland around the city - [Farm%20%28Civ5%29](Farms) can be built on [Hill%20%28Civ5%29](Hills) and [Tundra%20%28Civ5%29](Tundra) adjacent to Rivers, and receive an additional +1 early on (whereas all other Farms have to wait until the [Industrial%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Industrial Era)). A city located on the banks of a River can also construct a number of special [Building%20%28Civ5%29](buildings), such as the [Hydro%20Plant%20%28Civ5%29](Hydro Plant), which adds +1 to all tiles next to the River.
Rivers also protect a city, as it is quite difficult to mount an assault against a city across a River. [Unit%20%28Civ5%29](Units) expend all of their points when crossing rivers - even if the tiles are connected by [Road%20%28Civ5%29](roads) - until bridge-building techniques are discovered, and suffer a 20% penalty when attacking units on the other side of a River. If you control the banks of a River, you may gain a very important tactical advantage over an enemy.
As of "", Rivers no longer provide additional yield for neighboring tiles. However, they become incredibly important for trade, which is reflected by the additional bonus when opening routes to cities built on Rivers.
