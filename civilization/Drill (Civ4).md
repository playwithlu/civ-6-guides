# Drill (Civ4)

The drill line of [Promotion%20%28Civ4%29](promotion)s give [Military%20unit%20%28Civ4%29](military unit)s [First%20strike%20%28Civ4%29](first strikes), and reduce the amount of [Collateral%20damage%20%28Civ4%29](collateral damage) they take.
In [vanilla](vanilla) Civ4, drill was not available to gunpowder units. This capability was added... when?
