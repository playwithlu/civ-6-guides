# Tobacconist's House (Col)

A Tobacconist's house is a workshop where your colonists convert [Tobacco%20%28Col%29](Tobacco) into [Cigars%20%28Col%29](Cigars). Each colony receives a free Tobacconist's house; it may eventually be upgraded to a [Tobacconist%27s%20shop%20%28Col%29](Tobacconist's shop), followed by a [Cigar%20factory%20%28Col%29](Cigar factory).
Each unskilled worker in the Tobacconist's house converts 3 units of Tobacco into Cigars per turn. A [Master%20Tobacconists%20%28Col%29](Master Tobacconist) doubles this rate.
