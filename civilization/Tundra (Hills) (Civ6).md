# Tundra (Hills) (Civ6)

Tundra (Hills) is a base [Terrain%20%28Civ6%29%23Features](terrain) which is a variant of tiles in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". Like other Tundra tiles, they are usually found near the poles of the map.
Tundra Hills provide 1 in addition to the 1 produced by basic Tundra tiles. Tundra Hills may be improved with [Mine%20%28Civ6%29](Mines), which makes them significantly more productive than other Tundra tiles. All [Hills%20%28Civ6%29](Hills) have a +3 Combat Strength modifier, which can strengthen city defenses, as well as protect vulnerable units.
Strategy.
Similar to Tundra, the main problem with Tundra (Hills) is its lack of , which will hamper the growth of any settlement here. Unlike in "Civilization V", you can never build Farms on Tundra, except when you play as [Canada%20%28Civ6%29](Canada), so is another issue for Tundra cities. The only two civilizations with abilities that make Tundra a little bit more bearable are Canada and [Russia%20%28Civ6%29](Russia). Other than that, the only times you actually want to settle in the polar regions are when you try to secure a [Resource%20%28Civ6%29](Strategic Resource), want to build the [St.%20Basil%27s%20Cathedral%20%28Civ6%29](St. Basil's Cathedral) or the late game [Amundsen-Scott%20Research%20Station%20%28Civ6%29](Amundsen-Scott Research Station) on one of the nearby [Snow%20%28Civ6%29](Snow) tiles.
