# Satchel Charges (Civ6)/Civilopedia

A satchel charge is an explosive device including both the detonator and the charge, primarily used for demolition work. Legitimate demolition usually involves carefully placed charges with the smallest safe charge needed. Covert operations favor a much larger charge placed precisely, but hastily.
