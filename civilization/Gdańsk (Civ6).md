# Gdańsk (Civ6)

Gdańsk is a trade [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-state) from the [Jadwiga%27s%20Legacy%20%28Civ6%29](Jadwiga's Legacy) [List%20of%20scenarios%20in%20Civ6](scenario) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
Gdańsk's bonuses focus largely on income, including its [Suzerain%20%28Civ6%29](Suzerain) bonus. However, it should be noted that Gdańsk can easily become the first target of [Barbarian%20%28Civ6%29](Barbarians) and be lost in the first few turns, so it may be wiser to send one's starting s elsewhere.
