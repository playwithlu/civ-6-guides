Gameplay.
Ultra-Pressure Machinery is capable of operating under extremely harsh conditions. The {{LinkCTP2|Crawler}} is such a machine, capable of traveling to the absolute depths of the ocean and transporting land units.
Great Library entry.
The 21st century bore witness to the development of cities built on the bottom of the ocean called sea colonies. The initial colonies could only be constructed in shallow waters, however, because the tremendous pressure of the benthic oceans was too much for even the strongest machines to bear. Advances in fluid breathing systems and nanotechnology made it possible for industrial watercraft to withstand the pressures of the deep to build undersea colonies and conduct mining operations.
