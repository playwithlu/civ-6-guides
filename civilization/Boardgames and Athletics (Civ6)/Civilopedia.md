# Boardgames and Athletics (Civ6)/Civilopedia

The Nile people developed board games and athletics as an extension of war. Subjects who could run races, wrestle opponents, and hit distant targets with sling stone or arrow could apply those lessons to war. Likewise, those who could outwit opponents at senet or mehen could understand the importance of battlefield stratagems.
