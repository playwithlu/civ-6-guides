# Gold (currency) (CivRev)

Gold is the currency of civilization. It is an indicator of economic strength and is used to [Rush%20%28CivRev%29](rush) [List%20of%20units%20in%20CivRev](units), buy [List%20of%20technologies%20in%20CivRev](technology) from other [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20CivRev](civilizations), make treaties, and cause [List%20of%20leaders%20in%20CivRev](leaders) to attack one another. Gold is also associated with [Trade%20%28CivRev%29](trade).
Accumulating a total of 20,000 or more gold is the primary prerequisite to an [Victory%20%28CivRev%29](Economic Victory), in addition to building the [World%20Bank%20%28CivRev%29](World Bank).
As a resource, gold can be obtained from trade squares, gold deposits, and gem deposits. Certain [Building%20%28CivRev%29](buildings) can also increase gold production, including [Market%20%28CivRev%29](Markets), [Bank%20%28CivRev%29](Banks), and [Trading%20Post%20%28CivRev%29](Trading Posts). Additionally, some [Wonder%20%28CivRev%29](wonders) can contribute to the accumulation of gold. For example, the [Trade%20Fair%20of%20Troyes%20%28CivRev%29](Trade Fair of Troyes), when built, increases gold production in the [City%20%28CivRev%29](city) of origin by 100%.
There are several techs that can be researched to improve gold acquisition, such as [Currency%20%28CivRev%29](Currency), [Banking%20%28CivRev%29](Banking), and [Networking%20%28CivRev%29](Networking).
