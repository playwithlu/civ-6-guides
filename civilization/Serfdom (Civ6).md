# Serfdom (Civ6)

Serfdom is an Economic [Policy%20Cards%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
This Economic Policy replaces the earlier [Ilkum%20%28Civ6%29](Ilkum), but unlike others which similarly replace earlier Policies, it doesn't simply update the benefit to the new [Era%20%28Civ6%29](era); it actually changes it! Instead of a boost, Serfdom provides 2 more Build actions for each [Builder%20%28Civ6%29](Builder), for a total of 5 (without any additional bonuses). This allows a single Builder to almost do the work for two!
The way you use the Serfdom, however, doesn't change with respect to the earlier Policy - you should slot it, then hurry to build (or purchase) as many Builders as you need until the next change of your [Government%20%28Civ6%29](government) structure. Note that since the / cost of the [Units%20%28Civ6%29](unit) will keep going up, it will take more and more turns to build them, especially without the boost from the earlier Policy. This makes it more worthwhile to purchase Builders if you can afford it. Incidentally, this is not a bad idea, especially since you should have many new [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) at this moment of the game, which will benefit greatly from some Builders popping up at the click of a button, without all the fuss of producing them in your older cities, and then transporting them to the new ones.
