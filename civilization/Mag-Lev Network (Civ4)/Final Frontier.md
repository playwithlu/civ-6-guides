Civilopedia entry.
In the early twentieth century, a scientist named Walther Meissner noted that certain superconductive materials tended to give off a very small, but exceedingly powerful magnetic field. His discovery remains the basis for all modern Magnetic Levitation transportation. The PMX-04 Mag-Lev Engine continues to hold the record for fastest land speed vehicle in history, clocking in at over 15,000 kilometers per hour. Planets which have invested in Mag-Lev transportation have found their efficiency - and thus wealth - skyrocketing. Cheap and effective, Mag-Lev technology is used in the transport of goods and people, greasing the wheels of the planetary economy.
