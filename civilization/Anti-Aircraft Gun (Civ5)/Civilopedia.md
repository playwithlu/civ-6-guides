# Anti-Aircraft Gun (Civ5)/Civilopedia

These artillery tubes fire shells up into the air. Upon reaching a pre-set height the shells explode, sending an expanding ball of deadly shrapnel into any nearby aircraft. Anti-Aircraft (or "ack-ack") guns are quite vulnerable to attack from the ground: if left unprotected they can be easily destroyed by any enemy infantry or armed unit.
