# Ironworks (Civ4)

Strategy.
The Ironworks increases a [City%20%28Civ4%29](city's) production if that city has access to [Coal%20%28Civ4%29](Coal) and/or [Iron%20%28Civ4%29](Iron), but also adds unhealthiness. It increases its city's chances of generating a [Great%20Engineer%20%28Civ4%29](Great Engineer).
Making your most productive city your [Capital%20%28Civ4%29](capital), running [Bureaucracy%20%28Civ4%29](Bureaucracy) and building the Ironworks there provides a very strong base for building [List%20of%20wonders%20in%20Civ4](wonders). Alternatively, stacking this wonder with the [Moai%20Statues%20%28Civ4%29](Moai Statues), the [Heroic%20Epic%20%28Civ4%29](Heroic Epic) or [West%20Point%20%28Civ4%29](West Point) can be highly effective.
