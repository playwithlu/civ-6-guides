# Deck Crews (Civ6)/Civilopedia

In 1922, with the launch of the USS Langley, it became obvious that dedicated aircraft carriers would need dedicated flight deck (and later, hangar deck) crews for efficient launch and recovery operations, and maintenance of all the temperamental aeroplanes. By the time World War II got started, well-trained deck crews could land, service, and launch a squadron of planes as though their lives depended on it â€¦ as they did. The crews became highly organized, with a hierarchy of tasks under the supervision of the likes of the air officer, catapult officer, aircraft directors, signal officers, and dozens of others. Refueling, rearming, and repairs were handled on the flight deck in combat, sometimes even as the carrier was trying to avoid being sunk.
