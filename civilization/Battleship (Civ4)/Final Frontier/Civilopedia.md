# Battleship (Civ4)/Final Frontier/Civilopedia

The Battleship is the end result of the yearning for ultimate power in the universe. The last of the 'direct contact' warships to be developed, the Battleship is the pinnacle of destructive power. Mounted in a number of immense turrets, its weaponry is capable of vaporizing any weaker vessel. This might comes at a steep price, however: in addition to being incredibly expensive, battleships are also slow and vulnerable to longer-range indirect attacks from enemy Missiles and Bombers, which means that a Battleship must be protected from these assaults by a fleet of lesser Cruisers and Destroyers. The Battleship's cost and weaknesses often cause civilizations to shirk their use in favor of more practical ship types. However, if the Battleship's vulnerabilities can be protected, it can unleash unparalleled destruction upon any foe.
