# Cities (C-evo)

[City%20%28C-evo%29](City) names in [C-evo](C-evo) are set by the software, following the order in the relevant ".tribe" files. For no obvious reason, three tribes have fewer than 50 names but five have over 100. Some names, such as "Memphis" and "Richmond", are in the lists of more than one nation - either they are different places or they were occupied by different powers at different times. Some names are "wrong" - wrongly spelled or at least without the accents that the real place names have.
Initially there are 16 tribe files, but other tribes (e.g. Scots) can be added. No more than 15 will be used in any game. 
A user can edit each of the ".txt" files, perhaps to rearrange so that more familiar names come first, perhaps to make some of the colors more distinctive.
