# Turn (Civ2)

A game of "[Civilization%20II](Civilization II)" progresses by turns, representing variable intervals of time within the setting (usually decades, narrowing to individual years in late play). Each conducts a set of actions during a turn, with their effects resolved either during the turn itself, or at the start of the next turn.
If no has been claimed after a [%23Calendar](certain number) of turns, the civilization's leader "retires" and its standing score is entered into the [Hall%20of%20Fame](Hall of Fame). The player can continue the game beyond this point, but no further score changes will be submitted.
Order of operations.
A turn updates in two main stages: "globally" at the start of the calendar change, and then in discrete cycles for each civilization in active play. Global turn operations include calculating , processing , and publishing [Histories](Histories).
Each civilization's turn consists of two phases. The first, or "update" phase, resolves automated economic mechanics, namely, , and ; progress; and repair. The second, or "orders" phase, is the interactive stage in which the player may move units; conduct ; and reconfigure any ongoing actions. Depending on the player's , the turn can end automatically once all active units have received orders, or wait for manual confirmation (the key).
Certain game behaviour occurs in regular four-turn intervals, known as "[Oedo%20year](Oedo year)s", including uprisings and resolution of . [Glossary%20of%20Civilization%20terms%23Meta](Meta play) typically involves synchronizing research and revolutions to Oedo years.
Order of action.
Civilizations act in a fixed order, based on their color:
While not officially implemented in the retail game, simultaneous movement can be enabled for , whereby human players conduct their actions concurrently, rather than sequentially. It is enabled via manual adjustment of codice_1, normally located in the codice_2 directory, prior to hosting the game.
Calendar.
A standard game of "Civilization II" begins in [4000%20BC](4000 BC) and nominally ends at [2020%20AD](2020 AD). The exact number of turns, and the progression of the in-game calendar, varies based on the game's and size; Chieftain provides the maximum turns (570) and Deity the minimum (420). Technically, retirement is triggered by the calendar date, rather than total elapsed turns; see the [%23Spaceship%20exploit](spaceship exploit) below.
The following table details how map area determines total play time:
Note that when with a custom map, total turns are calculated from the last dimensions submitted to "Start a New Game" or "Customize World", not the size of the map itself. To ensure accurate calculation, the player must first designate a map size through one of these options, then return to the main menu and choose "Start on Premade World".
s may employ a calendar that subdivides by months; see the [%23Modding](Modding) section for details.
Spaceship exploit.
A standard game's mandatory retirement year triggers on the "calendar" date, "not" the number of elapsed turns. When a is launched, calendar progression changes to one year per turn, regardless of the stage of the game. Even if all active spaceships are destroyed, the calendar is not reset. This offers a potential whereby a civilization intentionally allows its spaceship to be destroyed: the game will continue to progress at a rate of 1 year per turn, granting bonus turns relative to its launch date.
Modding.
The game calendar can be configured through in the . "Turn Year Increment" determines how the calendar scales to turn progression: 0 uses the default dynamic scaling; a positive value adds this number of years per turn; a negative value activates a monthly calendar. "Starting Year" is the exact date of the initial turn. "Maximum Turns" is the total playable turns before the final score is tallied.
Calendar labels are found in the codice_3 section of . B.C./A.D. are defined at Lines 2 and 3, respectively; months at Lines 421â€“432.
