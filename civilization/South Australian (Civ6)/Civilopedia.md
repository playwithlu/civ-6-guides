# South Australian (Civ6)/Civilopedia

The central southern region of Australia is comprised of temperate coastal land, less temperate bush, and the unforgiving Outback. Despite a colonial reputation for consuming crows in the absence of other food, this is a myth—hungry South Australian colonists stuck to parrots and cockatoos, which were much tastier.
South Australia was the only colony created by an act of Britain’s Parliament. Deliberately designed as a free colony that forbade penal labor, it welcomed poor immigrants who wished to start anew, insisted on a principles of religious freedom, and guaranteed land rights for Aboriginals. From its 1836 inception in Adelaide, the colony largely stuck to its principles.
Outback stations reared sheep throughout South Australia. Although there was never a true gold rush in the colony, its extensive fields of wheat would come to support much of Australia by the end of the 19th Century.
