Unique ability.
+1 Economic policy slot in any . In "", gain 500 and grant 1 Governor Title or recruit a new [Governor%20%28Civ6%29](Governor).
Strategy.
Adam Smith is easily the single strongest Great Merchant in [vanilla](vanilla) "Civilization VI". [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](Policy) slots are incredibly valuable, both due to their versatility and potential benefits. Economic policy slots in particular can be useful for any type of [Victory%20%28Civ6%29](victory), offering benefits for s, [Adjacency%20bonus%20%28Civ6%29](adjacency bonuses), or .
In the expansions, Smith is slightly less impactful, but still much stronger than most other Great Merchants. Governor Titles are tied to the [List%20of%20civics%20in%20Civ6](civics tree), which limits the number that players can earn (until they're able to research [Future%20Civic%20%28Civ6%29](Future Civic), at least). Smith is one of the very few exceptions to this rule, which makes him very powerful. The extra , while nice, is rarely impactful at the point of the game where he becomes available.
Overall, Smith is a very impactful under all rulesets, and earning him should be a priority for any player.
