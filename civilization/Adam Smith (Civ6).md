# Adam Smith (Civ6)

Adam Smith is an {{Link6|Industrial Era}} [Great%20Merchant%20%28Civ6%29](Great Merchant) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Unique ability.
+1 {{EconomicPolicyIcon6}} Economic policy slot in any {{Link6|government}}. In "", gain 500 {{Gold6}} and grant 1 {{Governor6}} Governor Title or recruit a new [Governor%20%28Civ6%29](Governor).
Strategy.
Adam Smith is easily the single strongest Great Merchant in [vanilla](vanilla) "Civilization VI". [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](Policy) slots are incredibly valuable, both due to their versatility and potential benefits. {{EconomicPolicyIcon6}} Economic policy slots in particular can be useful for any type of [Victory%20%28Civ6%29](victory), offering benefits for {{TradeRoute6}}s, [Adjacency%20bonus%20%28Civ6%29](adjacency bonuses), or {{Production6}}.
In the expansions, Smith is slightly less impactful, but still much stronger than most other Great Merchants. {{GovernorTitle6}} Governor Titles are tied to the [List%20of%20civics%20in%20Civ6](civics tree), which limits the number that players can earn (until they're able to research [Future%20Civic%20%28Civ6%29](Future Civic), at least). Smith is one of the very few exceptions to this rule, which makes him very powerful. The extra {{Gold6}}, while nice, is rarely impactful at the point of the game where he becomes available.
Overall, Smith is a very impactful {{GreatPerson6}} under all rulesets, and earning him should be a priority for any player.
