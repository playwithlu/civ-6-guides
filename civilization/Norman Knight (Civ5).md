# Norman Knight (Civ5)

The Norman Knight is a unique unit from the scenario of "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)".
Game Info.
Unique mounted unit of the Normans. Replaces the [Knight%20%28Civ5%29](Knight). Requires Horses.
Strategy.
Norman Knights trade the mobility of the standard [Knight%20%28Civ5%29](Knight) for the ability to make more than one attack each turn, attack cities at no penalty, and gain defensive bonuses from terrain. As long as they don't try to fight [Pikeman%20%28Civ5%29](Pikemen) and [Huscarl%20%28Civ5%29](Huscarls) unaided, they're difficult for enemies to repel and absolutely devastating in groups. Use them to lead the charge against the English and smash through the gates of their cities!
Trivia.
The Norman Knight uses the same portrait and model as the regular Knight, which does not wear the conical helmet described above.
