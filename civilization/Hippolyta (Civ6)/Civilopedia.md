# Hippolyta (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Hippolyta is the queen of the Amazons, an all-female tribe of warriors thought to be daughters of Ares, the Greek god of war. They delighted in combat and rejected husbands and sons, although they would visit the men of a neighboring tribe once a year. The Greeks placed them just beyond their eastern border, usually in Asia Minor on the edges of the Black Sea. Perhaps their legend was a way for the Greeks to imagine a different society outside of the boundaries of what they considered civilization, or perhaps there was some sort of historical precedent for warrior women amongst the Scythians or other peoples of that region.
Hippolyta is a figure in a few stories featuring Heracles (Hercules). She possessed a magic girdle that protected her in battle, and one of Heracles’s labors was to steal it from her – quite the challenge even for the legendary strongman. According to some versions of the legend, Heracles charmed the Amazon, which so infuriated Hera that the goddess incited Hippolyta’s Amazons to attack.
The name "Amazon" has gotten a lot of use in the years since Hippolyta. The Spanish explorer Francisco de Orellana gave the title to the indigenous people that he met in what would become Brazil owing to how women fought alongside men. They fought so well, in fact, that de Orellana was to die on the river he had named, following a skirmish with local groups.
