The beauty of Rome's Sistine Chapel, whose ceiling was painted by Michelangelo, has long served as a testament to the mixture of strong religious beliefs and the love of art which pervaded Renaissance Europe. The artist devoted four years to the work, which depicts important scenes from Genesis and other books of the Bible. Few visitors to Michelangelo's Chapel failed to be moved by the artist's dedication to his subject, or his feeling for the nature of human struggle, suffering, and spiritual triumph.
