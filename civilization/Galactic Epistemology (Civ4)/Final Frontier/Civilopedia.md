# Galactic Epistemology (Civ4)/Final Frontier/Civilopedia

With starlanes laid and lifelines secure, backwater schools began springing up across the universe. Most Colonies were not well-equipped to train new generations of citizens and in a society dominated by the march of technology it was made a priority to establish such institutions. Often centering on one or two individuals with the proper tools to investigate the reaches of the universe, these early centers of learning grew into major institutions, dedicated to the understanding of space. Habitation Centers, Universities and Democracy (civically adjusted to fit multi-planet confederacies) were but a few of the universe-shaking trends to arise from this burst of Galactic Epistemology, or the desire to discover the use of knowledge in an interstellar age. It was from these early frontier schools that various philosophies dominated by the search for Knowledge first began to take shape, and a love of learning became one of humanity's more important priorities.
