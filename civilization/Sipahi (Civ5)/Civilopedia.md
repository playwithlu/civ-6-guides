# Sipahi (Civ5)/Civilopedia

The sipahi were the lancers of the Ottoman Empire. Founded during the reign of Murad I (ruled 1362 â€“ 1389), the sipahi were drawn from the ethnic Turk landed gentry. They were extremely highly motivated and loyal fighters and were the sultan's personal bodyguard. The sipahi were great rivals of the Janissaries (another special Ottoman unit), who were drawn from both Turkish and non-Turkish soldiers. In fact the sipahi enthusiastically assisted in the violent disbandment of the Janissaries in 1826, following an unsuccessful revolt by the latter group.
