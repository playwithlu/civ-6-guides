# Nilometer (Civ6)/Civilopedia

The people of the Nile Valley depended upon its annual floods (or “inundations”) for their very survival. The ingenious nilometers measured the height of the floodwaters: too high, and people could expect dangerous floods. Too low, and they would see famine. Anything between those marks indicated a relatively prosperous season.
