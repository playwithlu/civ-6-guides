# Jaguar (Civ5)/Civilopedia

In Aztec culture, war was as much a religious rite as it was a political tool. Young stallions had to capture or kill enemies in order to attain high status, and ever-increasing numbers of prisoners were needed as sacrifices for the Aztecs' religious rituals. The Jaguar Warriors were elite professional soldiers in the Aztec army. Clad in jaguar skins and equipped with deadly "macuahuitls" (wooden swords studded with sharp obsidian shards), the Jaguars were perhaps the deadliest light infantry found in Pre-Columbian Central and North America.
