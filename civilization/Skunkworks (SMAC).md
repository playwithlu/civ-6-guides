# Skunkworks (SMAC)

Strategy.
It may be useful to build a Skunkworks in a base with a morale-boosting facility, if you can afford to set aside a major base for building prototypes, instead of building secret projects. An undocumented feature: these remove the mineral penalty when switching production. Build a Skunkworks before building your first Planet Buster. You will save a lot of turns without the prototype penalty.
