# Armed Braves (Col)

Native Americans become increasingly dangerous as they learn to use the 
deadly weapons of the Europeans. When a native tribe obtains guns from 
the Europeans, some braves will be armed with them. This, combined 
with their knowledge of the wilderness, make them formidable opponents 
in the woods, hills, and mountains.
