Gameplay.
The Pikeman is the bane of any mounted units' existence. He is particularly adept at taking down [Knight%20%28CTP2%29](Knights) and [Mounted%20Archer%20%28CTP2%29](Mounted Archers) with the bladed polearm he wields. Though lacking a Ranged Attack, Pikemen are effective at both standard offense and defense.
Great Library entry.
For most of the medieval period, the horse-mounted knight dominated the battlefield of Europe. In 1476, however, at the Battle of Grandson, infantry returned to prominence. There, the Swiss Confederate army defeated the Burgundian Knights, using 600-man squares of eighteen-foot spiked poles. After this event, the pikemen became the mainstay of European infantry until the development of the musket.
