This page is a resource for ' fan mods.
"Beyond Earth" currently supports FireTuner, Mod Buddy (available in [Steam](Steam) Tools), and [http%3A//www.nexusmods.com/games/](Nexus).

Guides.
Also note that internally the game uses XML and Lua files for mods, just like "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)", so the links in the [Modding%20%28Civ5%29](Modding (Civ5)) article are largely valid with "Beyond Earth" as well.
