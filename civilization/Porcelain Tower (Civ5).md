# Porcelain Tower (Civ5)

Game Info.
Requires [Rationalism%20%28Civ5%29](Rationalism). ()
Strategy.
The Porcelain Tower Wonder is a must for those pursuing a [Science%20victory%20%28Civ5%29](scientific victory). It will not only boost your current research efforts, but will also give you a larger benefit from each research agreement you make! So, after building this wonder, try to stay friendly with as many players as possible and save your for research agreements.
It's a good idea to use the Great Scientist for an [Academy%20%28Civ5%29](Academy) instead of rushing a technology, as the long-term science rewards will likely be much larger than the short-term.
