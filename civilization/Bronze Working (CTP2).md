Great Library entry.
Around 3500 BC, Western Europeans discovered that beaten copper repeatedly heated in a fire became less brittle. Perhaps because tin and copper deposits often occurred together in nature, early metal workers combined the two to form bronze. This new alloy was strong, light and its raw materials were plentiful. The Greeks and Spartans found many uses for bronze, most notably for armor and weaponry. Phalanxes of hoplites, clad in bronze armor and wielding bronze swords and shields, menaced the armies of the Mediterranean and contributed to the dominance of the Spartan state in the 8th century BC.
