Gameplay.
Barbarian tribes inhabit every continent of the world and there are two types: Passive and Aggressive.
Passive barbarians reside in small villages. When you send a unit into one of these villages, several things can happen -- some good and some bad. Possible results range from learning a new Civilization Advance to enraging the residents and having to battle them.
These named tribes also reside in villages on the map, but they send out raiding parties to fight your units and pillage your cities and towns. By destroying a tribal village you can stop the raids from that village. But the survivors will move to a new site in explored or unexplored territory and begin raiding from there.
