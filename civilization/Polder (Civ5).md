# Polder (Civ5)

Game Info.
[List%20of%20improvements%20in%20Civ5%23Unique%20Tile%20Improvements](Unique improvement) of the [Dutch%20%28Civ5%29](Dutch civilization). Requires [Guilds%20%28Civ5%29](Guilds).
Strategy.
Thanks to the Polder, the Dutch are the only civilization capable of making use of [Marsh%20%28Civ5%29](marshes). In their hands, the normally useless wetland turns into a fertile paradise, and later is even able to aid and income! Look for every opportunity to settle areas with marshes or [Flood%20plains%20%28Civ5%29](flood plains) to make maximum use of this ability!
There is, however, a caveat. Since marshes by themselves are undesirable, the border expansion AI seems to avoid expanding to marsh hexes, even when playing as the Netherlands. As a result, sometimes you have to spend gold to buy the marsh hexes needed to build Polders.
Polders can be built anywhere, not just in Dutch territory. If playing in an alliance with a Dutch player, it's a good idea to refrain from improving marsh and flood plains tiles until the Dutch can send a [Worker%20%28Civ5%29](Worker) to build Polders abroad.
