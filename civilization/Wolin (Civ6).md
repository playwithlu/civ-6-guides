# Wolin (Civ6)

Wolin is a militaristic [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-state) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It was added in the [Babylon%20Pack%20%28Civ6%29](Babylon Pack).
Strategy.
Wolin's [Suzerain%20%28Civ6%29](Suzerain) bonus provides and points from kills. This gives it strong synergy with warmongers, particularly [Alexander%20%28Civ6%29](Alexander's) [Macedonian%20%28Civ6%29](Macedon) and [Babylonian%20%28Civ6%29](Babylon). Alexander's [Hetairoi%20%28Civ6%29](Hetairoi) already earns extra points from kills and receives additional Combat Strength from them, so Wolin's Suzerain bonus will allow him to attract Great Generals one after the other and launch a powerful cavalry assault after researching [Horseback%20Riding%20%28Civ6%29](Horseback Riding). Babylon, on the other hand, tends to unlock new [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](units) quickly thanks to its civilization ability; as a result, Babylonian Great Generals have a much shorter period of relevancy than those of other [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) (since each Great General's bonuses affects only units from its [Era%20%28Civ6%29](era) and the following era). Wolin lets them quickly earn a new Great General with knowledge that can be applied to their advanced units, even when Babylon has little incentive to build a lot of [Encampment%20%28Civ6%29](Encampments).
Notably, Wolin is a lot less relevant to civilizations that focus on naval warfare. The [Harbor%20%28Civ6%29](Harbor), unlike the Encampment, is a powerful district with a lot of applications, and these civilizations will often build Harbors in every single city, especially when playing on water-heavy [Map%20%28Civ6%29](maps). As a result, they'll have little to no trouble earning Great Admirals. [Brazilian%20%28Civ6%29](Brazil) is an exception here: despite having neither a [Coastal%20%28Civ6%29](coastal) [Starting%20bias%20%28Civ6%29](starting bias) nor good incentives to build Harbors en masse, becoming the Suzerain of Wolin can be useful for Brazil if they plan to be aggressive with their [Minas%20Geraes%20%28Civ6%29](Minas Geraes).
