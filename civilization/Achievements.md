# Achievements

Achievements are special goals within a game that do not directly affect [gameplay](gameplay) and are visible either in-game (for mobile games) or on [Steam](Steam) (for desktop games) when unlocked. They are meant to track one's overall progress through the game and give players some specific goals to pursue, if they so choose.
