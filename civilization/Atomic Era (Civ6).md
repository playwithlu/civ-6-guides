# Atomic Era (Civ6)

The Atomic Era is the seventh [Era%20%28Civ6%29](era) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is preceded by the [Modern%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Modern Era) and followed by the [Information%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Information Era).
Intro.
 New frontiers of discovery expand our understanding, from the tiny atom to the majesty of outer space. Mysteries long tolerated are closer than ever to revealing their deepest secrets, beyond what we can easily see. You will choose how to use this knowledge, and push back the greatest darkness we have yet faced.
Game Info.
The Atomic Era takes its name from the invention of the most terrible weapon known to man - the [Nuclear%20weapons%20%28Civ6%29](atomic bomb). But more broadly, it also brings about the power of the atom as means of - the cleanest and most powerful source. It is up to you to choose how you will use that power - to produce clean energy for your cities in peace, or to destroy the enemy in war.
Another thing the Atomic Era brings is the real conquest of the skies - with improved aircraft now separated into two different classes, air warfare really becomes a very serious endeavor. And improved Support units both on land and in the air, combined with the next level of air transport technology, speed up combat even more.
As if that weren't enough, man now reaches even higher - to space. The Rocketry technology unlocks the path towards the last type of victory: the Science Victory. Civilizations pursuing it will have to ensure Spaceports are constructed and guarded from the enemy, while also boosted with enough to complete the most complex Projects in the game: the Space Race projects.
Meanwhile, the pursuers of Cultural victory also get some more trump cards up their sleeves, with [Ski%20Resort%20%28Civ6%29](Ski Resorts) to attract even more tourists, while [Rock%20Band%20%28Civ6%29](Rock Bands) tour foreign lands to spread your cultural fame. The Tier 3 buildings unlocked in the Entertainment-oriented Districts also help to that goal.
