# Police State (Civ4)/Final Frontier/Civilopedia

The Police State is a time-honored tradition among paranoid dictators and god-complex-carrying father states. The phrase "status quo" takes on a holy meaning in the Police State, as all dissent is crushed by the principality's enormous secret police apparatus. As a result, War Weariness is greatly reduced by forcing the populace to remain quiet with the butt of a weapon. This same intricate and well-funded body of informants and undercover officers grants Police State leaders an impressive knowledge of their foes and allies. And to keep their trigger-happy commandants' personnel rosters full, Police States compliment their shadow army with an impressive military complex, churning out military production at a rate few other principalities can hope to match.
