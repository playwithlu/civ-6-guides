# Raj (Civ6)

Raj is a Diplomatic [Policy%20Cards%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
Raj is worth adopting if you've managed to become the [Suzerain%20%28Civ6%29](Suzerain) of many [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-states). +2 bonuses to , , , and may not sound like much, but receiving these bonuses from four city-states means a +8 bonus to each yield, which is nothing to sneeze at in the [Industrial%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Industrial Era). This holds doubly true when playing as [Pericles%20%28Civ6%29](Pericles), or if you've built [Kilwa%20Kisiwani%20%28Civ6%29](Kilwa Kisiwani) or the [Orsz%C3%A1gh%C3%A1z%20%28Civ6%29](Országház) for even richer bonuses.
