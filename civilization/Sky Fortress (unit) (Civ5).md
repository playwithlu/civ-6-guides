Most advanced airship unit. May act as base for a [Flyer%20%28ESS%29](Flyer). Powerful attacks, but vulnerable to Flyers.
Strategy.
The Sky Fortress is the most advanced type of airship unit, and houses significant firepower. Not only can it use its cannons to attack land targets and other airships, but also it can act as a mobile base for a Flyer. With a Flyer running strikes on nearby airship units, the Sky Fortress poses a serious threat to many types of units, but is still vulnerable to enemy Flyers and Anti-Air Guns.
