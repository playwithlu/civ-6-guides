Civilopedia entry.
While abstract knowledge remains the domain of the Research Lab, political and military information has its own master - the Intelligence Center. Charged with keeping tabs on friends and foes alike, Intelligence Centers meld the unending persistence of machine with the wily nature of man to create an organization capable of digging out nearly anything that can be known about anyone. Used as often for protection as for destruction, Intelligence Centers both increase the difficulty for an enemy to engage in Espionage and the ease at which their owners can do the same.
