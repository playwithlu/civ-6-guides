# Missile Silo (Civ6)

The Missile Silo is a standard [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](tile improvement) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
In "Civilization VI" nuclear weapons may not be launched from [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities). You must build special Missile Silos for that, or acquire one of the other special able to launch (or drop) them.
Note that each of these devices has a maximum Range (12 for s and 15 for s), so where exactly you decide to put a Missile Silo matters quite a bit. If you put it in the middle of your empire you won't be able to hit anything important, so consider where your conflicts will force you to use weapons of mass destruction, and build a Missile Silo in your nearest city's territory.
