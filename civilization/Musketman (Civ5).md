# Musketman (Civ5)

Game Info.
First gunpowder infantry unit of the game. Upgrades from the [Longswordsman%20%28Civ5%29](Longswordsman).
Strategy.
The Musketman is the first gunpowder unit in the game, and although it's not much more powerful than its predecessor, it is a necessary step to continue to the other, more powerful units in the late middle game. Also, the Musketman doesn't require like the Longswordsman or like the [Knight%20%28Civ5%29](Knight), allowing them to be built in larger numbers if [Resources%20%28Civ5%29%23Strategic%20Resources](strategic resources) are scarce and making [Pikeman%20%28Civ5%29](Pikemen) and other anti-cavalry units less effective at repelling them.
The Musketman is available soon after the Longswordsman, and the requisite [List%20of%20technologies%20in%20Civ5](tech)Â is in much the same part of the tech tree. For this reason, many offensive players choose to rush straight to the Musketman (researching [Gunpowder%20%28Civ5%29](Gunpowder) immediately after [Steel%20%28Civ5%29](Steel)), as it is slightly stronger and provides an even greater advantage in battle.
