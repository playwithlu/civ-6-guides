Game Info.
Luxury resource.
Strategy.
 Wine is found in "warm" climates, primarily on open [Plains%20%28Civ5%29](Plains). It is improved with a [Plantation%20%28Civ5%29](Plantation).
 Wine is one of two luxuries, along with , which is important for [Religion%20%28Civ5%29](religion). First, the Goddess of Festivals belief nets a bonus 1 and on the tile; and second, the [Monastery%20%28Civ5%29](Monastery) grants an additional +1 and . Combining the effects of these two bonuses, a single improved Wine resource may yield 1 (after researching [Fertilizer%20%28Civ5%29](Fertilizer)), 3 , 2 , and 2 , plus whatever base yield the [Terrain%20%28Civ5%29](terrain) has.
Unfortunately, apart from and , Wine blocks the standard [List%20of%20improvements%20in%20Civ5](improvements) and so isn't good for regular yields.
