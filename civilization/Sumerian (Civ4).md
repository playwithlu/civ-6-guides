The Sumerian people represent a [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ4](civilization) in "[Civilization%20IV](Civilization IV)".
Strategy.
The Sumerian Empire is a balanced nation. [Gilgamesh%20%28Civ4%29](Gilgamesh's) "[Creative%20%28Civ4%29](Creative)" [Leader%20trait%20%28Civ4%29](trait) provides Sumerian [City%20%28Civ4%29](cities) with extra culture and extra-large [Borders%20%28Civ4%29](borders), while his "[Protective%20%28Civ4%29](Protective)" trait makes life difficult for any enemies foolish enough to cross them. This is especially true once they encounter the [Vulture%20%28Civ4%29](Vulture), the powerful Sumerian replacement for the [Axeman%20%28Civ4%29](Axeman). Finally, the Sumerian [Ziggurat%20%28Civ4%29](Ziggurat), an easily produced [Courthouse%20%28Civ4%29](Courthouse), will bring speedy stability to Sumerian cities.
