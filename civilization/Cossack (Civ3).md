# Cossack (Civ3)

The [Russian%20%28Civ3%29](Russian) unique unit, Cossacks replace [Cavalry%20%28Civ3%29](Cavalry). Cossacks are fast-moving and will
withdraw from combat if losing (unless fighting another fast unit).
A Russian city must have both horses and saltpeter in its Strategic Resource box to build Cossacks.
Conquests Changes.
The Cossack loses 1 point of defense, but gains Blitz giving it the ability to attack multiple times per turn (as much any times as it has movement points left). This change makes the Cossack more offensively minded than before.
