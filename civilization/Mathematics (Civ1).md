# Mathematics (Civ1)

Mathematics allows the building of [Catapult%20%28Civ1%29](catapults), the first powerful offensive unit.
It is a prerequisite of [Astronomy%20%28Civ1%29](astronomy), [Computers%20%28Civ1%29](computers), [Physics%20%28Civ1%29](physics) and [University%20%28advance%29%20%28Civ1%29](university).
Civilopedia entry.
From the earliest Alphabets, some symbols came to represent the concept of numbers. Mathematics arose from the needs of agriculture and commerce to keep track of quantities, accounts, and measurements. Farmers needed to know the size of the yield from their fields. Traders needed to know what they had available for barter and the rates of exchange. Masons needed to know the dimensions of the structure they were building. The development of Mathematics was critical to the future advance of Physics and other sciences.
