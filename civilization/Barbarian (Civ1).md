# Barbarian (Civ1)

Barbarians do not function as a regular [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ1](civilization), instead, their role in the game mirrors the nomadic hordes; bandit, pirate, and rebel states; peasant, slave, and ethnic uprisings. During game setup, the player must select the level of Barbarian activity, from codice_1 to codice_2. Some [Minor%20Tribe%20%28Civ1%29](goody huts) unleash hordes of Barbarians!
Color.
The Barbarians are the only red civilization and go eighth in turn order.
Barbarian leader.
A [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ1](unit) specific to the Barbarian civilization is the "Barbarian Leader". The leader takes no action apart from following its horde, usually stacking itself under an offensive unit. If another civilization can kill the barbarian leader by itself, it receives a "ransom" of 100 [Gold%20%28currency%29%20%28Civ1%29](Gold). However, once a leader's escort is destroyed, it will usually attempt to flee; if it can reach an area far enough away from other civilizations' [City%20%28Civ1%29](cities), it can disband itself prior to capture.
Gameplay.
Barbarians land from ships or appear in uninhabited inland areas. Sea raiders are seeking a city to capture and do not pillage. Inland raiders seek loot. Barbarian uprisings destroy [Irrigation%20%28Civ1%29](irrigation) and [Mine%20%28Civ1%29](mines).
Expanding over a continent reduces the areas that barbarians can appear in, eventually removing the threat, but they can always appear from the sea. Technology level of barbarian units grows over time, roughly following the levels of players, but never reaches modern units.
