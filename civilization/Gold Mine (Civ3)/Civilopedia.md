# Gold Mine (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Columbus sailed west in search of spices, but he and the Spaniards that followed him to
the New World became rich on gold instead. Gold was plentiful enough in the Americas
that the Spaniards were amazed at the riches of the Aztecs and Inca. In addition, several Spanish colonies in the New World were sited near major gold deposits. Here the Spanish would establish mining and minting operations, creating the famous Spanish doubloon to allow the 
gold coins and ingots to be shipped back to Spain.
