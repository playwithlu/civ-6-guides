# Spaceship (CivRev)

The Spaceship is a game element in "[Civilization%20Revolution](Civilization Revolution)". Building it is one of the steps required to win a [Victory%20%28CivRev%29](Technology Victory).
A Spaceship consists of four parts, all of which are unlocked by [Space%20Flight%20%28CivRev%29](Space Flight):
Building more than one Spaceship Fuel or Spaceship Propulsion will allow the Spaceship to reach its destination faster, while building more than one Spaceship Habitation or Spaceship Life Support will increase the owner's final score when it does.
If a player's Spaceship reaches [Alpha%20Centauri%20%28star%20system%29](Alpha Centauri) before anyone else achieves one of the victory conditions, that player wins the game.
