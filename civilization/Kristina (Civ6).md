She leads the [Swedish%20%28Civ6%29](Swedes) in "".
Kristina uses the politics of the [World%20Congress%20%28Civ6%29](World Congress) and culture to win [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Diplomacy](diplomatic victories).
Intro.
 Minerva of the North, unmatched in learning and wisdom, you chose a life of culture over that of power. Light up your kingdom with art and music. Let Sweden be the guiding star for other civilizations to follow. Once more the world has a need for great patrons of the arts and culture—and it looks to you.
In-Game.
Kristina's unique [Agenda%20%28Civ6%29](agenda) is Bibliophile. She tries to collect as many [Great%20Work%20%28Civ6%29](Great Works) as possible and dislikes [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) with a large number of Great Works.
Her [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader ability) is Minerva of the North. All her [Building%20%28Civ6%29](buildings) with three or more Great Work slots and all her [Wonder%20%28Civ6%29](wonders) with two or more Great Work slots are automatically [Theming%20bonus%20%28Civ6%29](themed) once their slots are filled, and she is able to build the [Queen%27s%20Bibliotheque%20%28Civ6%29](Queen's Bibliotheque) in her [Government%20Plaza%20%28Civ6%29](Government Plaza).
