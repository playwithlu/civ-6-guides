# Nonlinear Mathematics (SMAC)

By using the power of [Information%20Networks%20%28SMAC%29](Information Networks) to speed calculations and encourage collaborations, researchers make giant strides in the field of Nonlinear Mathematics, with significant military applications.
Nonlinear Mathematics is a second-level Conquer technology that requires [Applied%20Physics%20%28SMAC%29](Applied Physics) and [Information%20Networks%20%28SMAC%29](Information Networks) to be available for discovery. It makes the [Particle%20Impactor](Particle Impactor) weapon (weapon class 4) available for one's units.
