# Trireme (Civ4)

The Trireme is one of the first warships available in "[Civilization%20IV](Civilization IV)". It is used primarily to attack or defend [Galley%20%28Civ4%29](Galleys). It can be upgraded to a [Caravel%20%28Civ4%29](Caravel) if [Optics%20%28Civ4%29](Optics) is researched, or a [Frigate%20%28Civ4%29](Frigate) if [Chemistry%20%28Civ4%29](Chemistry) is researched.
Strategy.
Triremes are especially effective in combat against Galleys, but they have no transport capacity. They cannot enter ocean spaces.
