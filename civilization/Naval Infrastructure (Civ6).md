# Naval Infrastructure (Civ6)

Naval Infrastructure is an Economic [Policy%20Cards%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
Another Economic Policy which depends on adjacency bonuses, Naval Infrastructure is not that important unless you're building a trade empire and have many well-situated [Harbor%20%28Civ6%29](Harbors).
Don't forget that the adjacency bonus for the Harbor district is {{Gold6}}! So, this policy will potentially increase the size of your treasury. Again, it is only worth using an Economic Slot on it if you are either focusing on {{Gold6}} and will use it to purchase lots of stuff, or are so desperate for {{Gold6}} that you need every extra bit. However, keep in mind that another Economic Policy, [Caravansaries%20%28Civ6%29](Caravansaries), has the potential to yield more {{Gold6}}! As a rule of thumb, you should go with Naval Infrastructure if you have well-situated Harbors (meaning they have good adjacency bonuses) and Caravansaries if you have many {{TradeRoute6}}s. 
Another use of this policy is with the [Age%20%28Civ6%29](Golden Age) dedication "Free Inquiry", providing the same boost to your {{Science6}} output.
