# Mato Tipila (Civ6)

Mato Tipila is a single-tile impassable {{Link6|Natural Wonder}} available in "". It provides +1 {{Faith6}}, +1 {{Production6}} and 2 [Appeal%20%28Civ6%29](Appeal) to adjacent tiles.
Discovering Mato Tipila grants +1 [Era%20Score%20%28Civ6%29](Era Score), or +3 Score if the player is the first to do so.
Strategy.
Like other impassable wonders, the Mato Tipila wonder tile offers no benefits, and cannot be developed or improved. However, its tile provides +1 {{Faith6}}, +1 {{Production6}} and 2 [Appeal%20%28Civ6%29](Appeal) to up to six adjacent tiles; these yields are cumulatively worth considerably more than the dead tile. It is usually worth incorporating single-tile wonders within city borders to maximize their yields.
Early valuable {{Faith6}} generation means early Pantheon for whoever settles near this Natural Wonder. The {{Production6}} bonus also goes without saying that it benefits every civilization equally. Overall, Mato Tipila is a good but a very generic Natural Wonder, as it offers some good but not in any way outstanding tile yields.
