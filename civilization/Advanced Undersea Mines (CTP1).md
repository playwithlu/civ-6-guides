Gameplay.
Advanced undersea mines are sophisticated robotic, mechanized sites that create an additional +60-100 {{LinkCTP1|production}} and +10 {{LinkCTP1|gold}} when worked. This improvement takes two turns to build and, depending on the terrain, costs 1,000-1,400 PW.
Great Library entry.
The second revolution in mining occurred in the early 22nd century. Developments in robotics and undersea construction allowed mining companies to employ robots to mine deep into the ocean floor without risking human lives.
