# Drought (Civ6)

A Drought is a type of [Disasters%20%28Civ6%29](disaster) in "". It affects [Plains%20%28Civ6%29](Plains) and [Grassland%20%28Civ6%29](Grassland) terrain and it is the longest lasting disaster in the game. At the same time its sheer destructive power is far smaller than other disasters.
There are two different levels of Droughts: Major and Extreme (a.k.a. 'Withering'). The first one lasts for 5 turns, the second one for 10 turns.
Note that after the [Civilization%20VI%20April%202019%20Update](Antarctic Late Summer Update) Droughts gain an additional destructive effect past [Climate%20%28Civ6%29%23Phases%20of%20Climate%20Change](Climate Change) Phase V, called desertification. This effect consists of removing tile yields gained earlier in the game from other disasters! The chance of this occurring is 15% for Phase V Climate change, plus an additional 15% for each successive phase. This makes them potentially even more destructive at this latest stage of the game.
