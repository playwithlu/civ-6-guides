Civilopedia entry.
Map Making was an offshoot of the development of the Alphabet. With this technology if became possible to record the location of important places and features on animal skins, clay tablets, tree bark, or other materials, and thus pass on this information to others. This was especially useful to seamen, who often ventured far from home along strange coasts with their only guide being the Maps made by those who had sailed there previously. Map Making encouraged travel and exploration by making it less risky. It was the beginning of the skills that became the science of Navigation.
