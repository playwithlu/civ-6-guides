# Temple to Amun (Civ6)/Civilopedia

To understand the god Amunâ€™s importance to the Nile region, look to his temples. The Temple of Amun at Karnak is so vast it could hold five Great Pyramids. The Temple of Amun at Jebel Barkal in Nubia might have attained such splendor, if the Romans hadn't smashed it to pieces in 25 BCE.
