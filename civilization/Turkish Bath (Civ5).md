Strategy.
The Turkish Bath is the Ottoman unique building. Like a stock exchange the Turkish Bath increases the city's wealth. However, the Turkish Bath also increases the amount of {{Gold5}} a city generates. Trade routes other players make to a city with a Market will generate an extra 2 {{Gold5}} for the city owner and the trade route owner gains an additional 1 {{Gold5}} for the trade route. The city must have a Bank before the Turkish Bath may be constructed.
