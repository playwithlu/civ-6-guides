Strategy.
In [vanilla](vanilla) "Civilization VI", Irene of Athens is a fairly strong Great Merchant. If possible, she should be sent to a faraway [Continent%20%28Civ6%29](continent) to increase the chances of finding a Luxury resource not present in your home [Territory%20%28Civ6%29](territory) so you won't have to bother trading for it with a potential future rival. In addition, an extra is always helpful, and can provide a much-needed boost of in the early to midgame.
However, the expansions transform Irene of Athens from a decent Great Merchant to one of the most impactful in the game. Governor Titles are very difficult to unlock and limited almost entirely to the [List%20of%20civics%20in%20Civ6](civics tree). An extra Governor Title is incredibly difficult to come by and very valuable. Earning Irene of Athens should be a priority every game, even when playing as a [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) or [Leaders%20%28Civ6%29](leader) who doesn't have a strong incentive to build [Commercial%20Hub%20%28Civ6%29](Commercial Hubs).
