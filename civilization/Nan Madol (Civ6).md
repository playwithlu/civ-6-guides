# Nan Madol (Civ6)

Nan Madol is a cultural [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-state) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". 
Strategy.
A very simple ability, but one that has the potential to provide massive amounts of {{Culture6}}. Note that this bonus does not apply to the [City%20Center%20%28Civ6%29](City Center). Interestingly, the bonus also applies to [Wonder%20%28Civ6%29](Wonders) placed on or next to [Coast%20%28Civ6%29](Coast) or [Lake%20%28Civ6%29](Lake) [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles) even though the ability does not expressly mention it. Notably, the bonus from wonders is received as soon as construction is started (as opposed to {{DistrictIcon6}} [District%20%28Civ6%29](Districts), which need to be completed).
Example.
In the screenshots below, [Nidaros](Nidaros) is generating 123.6 {{culture6}} per turn, and has +55% modifiers (+30% from [Kilwa%20Kisiwani%20%28Civ6%29](Kilwa Kisiwani), +15% from [Pingala%20%28Educator%29%20%28Civ6%29](Pingala), +10% from {{Amenities6}}). There are nine {{DistrictIcon6}} [District%20%28Civ6%29](Districts) and wonders (excluding the City Center) that border Lake or Coast, which contributes +18 {{Culture6}}. The third {{Envoy6}} at Nan Madol contributes +2 {{Culture6}}, for a total of +20 {{Culture6}}. With the +55% modifier, the new {{Culture6}} per turn is:
formula_1
Note that the unfinished [Industrial%20Zone%20%28Civ6%29](Industrial Zone) does not yield +2 {{Culture6}}, while the unfinished [Great%20Zimbabwe%20%28Civ6%29](Great Zimbabwe) does.
Nan Madol has the perfect synergy with any maritime [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization), or just any empire that has a lot of [Coastal%20%28Civ6%29](coastal) or lakeside {{DistrictIcon6}} [District%20%28Civ6%29](Districts). These include [Norwegian%20%28Civ6%29](Norway), [Australian%20%28Civ6%29](Australia), [Indonesian%20%28Civ6%29](Indonesia), [Phoenician%20%28Civ6%29](Phoenicia), and the [Dutch%20%28Civ6%29](Netherlands).
