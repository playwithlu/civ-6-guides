Before Writing, human beings had only to rely on speech and art to convey their ideas. Writing makes available the documentation of everything from the inventory of a shop to the history of a culture.
The discovery of Writing gives birth to a new world of cultural advancement.
Great Library entry.
As ancient societies developed, early humans found a need to visibly represent the language they spoke. Whether it was to document their history, keep records or facilitate communication, writing's origins were almost certainly borne out of need. Although the world is full of examples of prehistoric communication, most notably in the form of cave paintings, writing systems did not begin to appear until ancient times. Writing systems developed in many ways. Some cultures developed a meaning-based system, with characters and symbols that represented words, acts, and concepts, while others developed sound-based systems, with characters representing syllables or phonemes. Whether pictographic, ideographic, alphabetic or phonetic, the writing system needed to match the demands of the societies' expressions and communications. Nevertheless, writing was a giant leap forward in the establishment of history and culture for early societies, leading to a strengthening of social order, jurisprudence and historical preservation.
