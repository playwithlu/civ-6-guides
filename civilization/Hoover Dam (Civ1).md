For centuries mankind has been harnessing the power of rushing water to power waterwheels, but more recently water was found useful for generating electricity. To derive power from rivers, dams were built to assure a dependable supply of water, then the overflow was released through special chambers where the moving water turned giant turbines, generating electricity. The Hoover Dam was one of the earliest hydroelectric dams, taming the Colorado River to bring electricity to the deserts of Arizona.
