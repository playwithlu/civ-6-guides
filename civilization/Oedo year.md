# Oedo year

In "[Sid%20Meier%27s%20Civilization](Sid Meier's Civilization)" and "[Civilization%20II](Civilization II)", certain game actions occur at regular four-[turn](turn) intervals, colloquially known as "oedo years". The term is named after the forum user oedo, who first documented the pattern as the "xxxo rule".
Oedo years are most commonly associated with [Glossary%20of%20Civilization%20terms%23Meta](meta) strategies to minimize [anarchy](anarchy). They also provide forecasts for [barbarian](barbarian) piracy. Oedo years may link to other mechanics, but these have not been documented.
## Overview

An oedo year occurs every fourth game turn. On this date, [anarchy](anarchy) ends and [civilizations](civilizations) can adopt a new [government](government). A common player strategy in "Civilization II" is to time to acquire a government on the oedo year, as the prompt to change government occurs before anarchy is resolved in the ; thus, anarchy's disruptive effects can be partially or fully bypassed. Otherwise, instigating a revolution the turn before the oedo year minimizes anarchy's duration; the [Pyramids%20%28Civ1%29](Pyramids (Civ1)) and [Statue%20of%20Liberty%20%28Civ2%29](Statue of Liberty (Civ2)) [Wonder](Wonder)s provide the same effect.
Seaborne [barbarian](barbarian)s spawn on oedo years. The exact onset date is determined by the player's [difficulty%20level](difficulty level), after which new pirates appear every two oedo years (8 turns) as permitted by game rules. It is less clear whether land-based hordes follow oedo cycles.
Reference charts.
Tracking oedo years is complicated by the lack of an in-game turn counter. As a standard game progresses, the interval between calendar dates narrows. The following tables provide easy reference for oedo turns and their corresponding calendar year.
