# Incan (Civ5)

The Incan people (or Inca(s)) represent a [DLC%20%28Civ5%29](DLC) [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilization) for "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)" that was released in December 2010 along with the [Spanish%20%28Civ5%29](Spanish) and the [Conquest%20of%20the%20New%20World%20%28Civ5%29](Conquest of the New World) [List%20of%20scenarios%20in%20Civ5](scenario).
Strategy.
The main strength of the Inca lies in their ability to use the [Hill%20%28Civ5%29](hill) [Terrain%20%28Civ5%29%23Terrain%20Features](terrain feature) much more efficiently than any other civilization. [Road%20%28Civ5%29](Roads) and [Railroad%20%28improvement%29%20%28Civ5%29](Railroads) cost no maintenance in hills, and half anywhere else. This will increase your GPT from inland City Connections significantly. To further their effectiveness in hills, their [Unique%20improvement%20%28Civ5%29](unique improvement), the [Terrace%20Farm%20%28Civ5%29](Terrace Farm), allows them to extract from hills without having to find one with access to fresh water. Look for opportunities to settle in hilly areas to make the most of these advantages; also, look for [Mountain%20%28Civ5%29](mountains) and try to settle near them (as the Terrace Farm's effect is even greater near mountains). You will end up with [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities) strong in both and potential.
Their other strength is their exceptional mobility in hills, which may confer them an important advantage if used properly. Use their [Unique%20unit%20%28Civ5%29](unique unit), the [Slinger%20%28Civ5%29](Slinger), to harass your foes without fear of repercussions.
