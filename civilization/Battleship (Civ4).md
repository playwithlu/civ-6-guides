# Battleship (Civ4)

Strategy.
Battleships are the most powerful warships afloat. They can sink most other vessels they meet (though they are vulnerable to submarine and air attack). Further, when attacking, Battleships cause collateral damage to other enemy [Naval%20unit%20%28Civ4%29](naval units) sharing the target's space. They can also bombard enemy city defenses.
