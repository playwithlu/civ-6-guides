GreeceSelect-005: ποιο ειναι το σχεδιο / Poio einai to schedio (Pronounced "pio ine to shedio," meaning "what is the plan?" For anyone actually pronouncing these, "shedio" is not pronounced with a "sh" sound, as Greek doesn't really have "sh" sounds. The "s" and the "h" are pronounced separately.)
GreeceSelect-006: ναι / Nai; (The ";" signifies it is being asked, as a question. Pronounced "neh," literally meaning "yes?" Interestingly, "neh" is less formal than Greek "oriste", which also means "yes?")
