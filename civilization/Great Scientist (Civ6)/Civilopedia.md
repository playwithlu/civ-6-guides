# Great Scientist (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Great scientists try to offer innovative and insightful notions of how the world does work … as opposed to philosophers and prophets who offer thoughts on how the world should work. In some cases, the lines between these – especially as the notion of directed mutagenesis, quantum physics, asymptotic math, and other theoretical constructs take hold – can be very thin indeed. One of mankind’s best, or worst, attributes is curiosity, and this is something great scientists have in plenty. They pry into everything natural and unnatural, and the results of their “scientific method” can be a boon or a curse, and often both, to their fellows. Despite the academic arcade that issues advanced degrees in every scientific cul-de-sac possible and the monolithic corporate research institutes (for these days science is a lucrative business), there is still room for the occasional great scientist to come along and change everything yet again.
