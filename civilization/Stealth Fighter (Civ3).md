# Stealth Fighter (Civ3)

Stealth fighters can do almost everything normal jet fighters do and more. They can execute all
air missions, except air superiority. Due to their stealth technology, stealth fighters
are very difficult to intercept by enemy air superiority fighters, and/or SAM batteries. And they have radar that allows them to see two squares,
regardless of blocking terrain.
A city must have oil and aluminum in its Strategic Resource box to build a stealth fighter.
