# Delhi (Civ6)/Civilopedia

This ancient city, sometimes said to be over 3500 years old, would play hosts to numerous faiths including Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam. However, it would also endure purges, such as during the so-called 'Slave Dynasty' of Sultan Qutb-ud-din Aybak, who would dramatically expand mosque construction while ordering 27 Jain temples be destroyed.
