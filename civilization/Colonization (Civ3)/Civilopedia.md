# Colonization (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Shortly after Pope Alexander VI divided the New World between the Portuguese and the Spanish in the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas, the colonization of the New World was begun. Spain began settling on Hispaniola and in the Caribbean; Portugal
founded towns along the coast of Africa and in Brazil; and France, England and the Netherlands concentrated on North America.
The establishment of new colonies included the foundation of plantations and mines that served as production centers. The goods produced here were then shipped back to Europe and helped fuel the European economies of the day.
