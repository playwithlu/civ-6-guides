# Longships (Civ6)/Civilopedia

The Viking longship design evolved over millennia, from the prehistoric Scandinavian umiak to the clinker-built Nydam ship of the 6th century. By the 9th century the longship was graceful, long but narrow, shallow-draft (able to navigate up rivers), and lightweight (for portage). The speedy wooden ships made the Vikings masters of the seas, and the sight of longships on the horizon caused fear through much of Europe until the 13th Century.
