Kings date back at least as far as the Sumerians in 3000 BC. The Sumerian kings differed from tyrants in one critical aspect - whereas the tyrant answered to no one, the Sumerian King represented the community to the deity Ningirsu and so obeyed the same rules and held the same rights as his subjects. As the deity protected private property, the king had to pay for any land that he acquired.
