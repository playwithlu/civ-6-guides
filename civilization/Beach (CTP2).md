Gameplay.
Beach tiles are excellent places to build {{LinkCTP2|Cities}} next to, as any city on a tile adjacent to a beach tile may build naval units. Cities near beaches can also take advantage of such ocean-based {{LinkCTP2|Tile Improvements}} as {{LinkCTP2|Nets}}, {{LinkCTP2|Undersea Tunnels}} and {{LinkCTP2|Ports}}. 
Beaches are fertile ground for fish and other seafood, and give moderate levels of {{LinkCTP2|Food}} to any {{LinkCTP2|Nets}} or {{LinkCTP2|Fisheries}} built on them. They also provide minimal {{LinkCTP2|Production}} and {{LinkCTP2|Commerce}}.
