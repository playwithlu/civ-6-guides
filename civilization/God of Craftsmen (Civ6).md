# God of Craftsmen (Civ6)

God of Craftsmen is a [Pantheon%20%28Civ6%29](Pantheon) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It provides +1 to all [Mine%20%28Civ6%29](Mine) [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](improvements) built on [Resource%20%28Civ6%29%23Strategic](strategic resources) (i.e., , , , , and ). In "", it provides +1 and +1 for all improved strategic resources.
Strategy.
In [vanilla](vanilla) "Civilization VI" and "", God of Craftsmen is generally not quite as useful as [Religion%20%28Civ5%29%23Pantheons](its "Civilization V" incarnation). Its greatest limitation is that you'll likely have to pick your pantheon long before you actually know where most minable strategic resources are located, and if you want to make optimal use of it, you may have to make difficult decisions about where to found new [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities).
This pantheon is a good choice for [Nubian%20%28Civ6%29](Nubia), as it will double the bonus their [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](civilization ability) provides from Mines built on strategic resources. The [Gallic%20%28Civ6%29](Gauls) will also make great use of this pantheon, as they are naturally drawn to strategic resources to boost their [Oppidum%20%28Civ6%29](Oppida) and place Mines. For all other [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations), it's more situational, and it's most useful in the early [Era%20%28Civ6%29](eras) regardless - late in the game, a +1 bonus from Aluminum and Uranium Mines isn't going to help much.
In "Gathering Storm", God of Craftsmen also provides extra and extends its bonuses to [Horses%20%28Civ6%29](Horse) [Pasture%20%28Civ6%29](Pastures), [Oil%20Well%20%28Civ6%29](Oil Wells), and [Offshore%20Oil%20Rig%20%28Civ6%29](Offshore Oil Rigs), making it more useful in the later eras and a more attractive pantheon overall.
