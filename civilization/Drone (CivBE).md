# Drone (CivBE)

Drone
A flying alien unit; like a [Helicopter%20Gunship%20%28Civ5%29](Helicopter Gunship) from "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)", it can traverse land or sea terrain.
Strategy.
A good target for [Leash%20Alien%20%28CivBE%29](Leash Alien), as not only is it one of the fastest alien units, but it's also able to fly over all terrain except mountains, making it very useful for finding exploration sites and for finding and taking resource pods.
