One of the most incredible wonders of the world, the Great Wall of China stretches for 1,500 miles along the border between Northern China and Mongolia. It is an amalgamation of many walls built at different points in ancient history; the first unified wall was built in the 3rd century BC by the Ch'in dynasty. Many of the laborers, conscripted from all over China, died during the project. The Ming dynasty (1368-1644) later added to it. Guard stations and watchtowers are placed at regular intervals. It averages 25 ft in height and is 15 ft to 30 ft thick at the base, sloping to 12 ft at the top. Although the western part of the wall is just an earth mound, the eastern part is earth and stone faced with brick. China suffered many invasions from the North, which unfortunately proved the Great Wall to be of little military significance. The fact that much of it still stands in modern times is a testament to the durability of masonry.
