# Physics (Civ1)

Physics is the study of matter and energy and their interactions.
It is a prerequisite of [Atomic%20Theory%20%28Civ1%29](atomic theory), [Flight%20%28Civ1%29](flight), [Magnetism%20%28Civ1%29](magnetism) and [Steam%20Engine%20%28Civ1%29](steam engine).
Civilopedia entry.
The study of Physics came into being from abstract theories of Mathematics and the practical experience of engineers and sailors. Concerned with the study of matter and energy, and the relationships between them, classical Physics dealt with phenomena within the bounds of normal observation: motion, acoustics, thermodynamics, and optics. These studies in turn led to further advances in areas such as Magnetism and Electricity. Modern Physics is primarily concerned with the behavior of matter and energy under extreme conditions or at extreme scales.
