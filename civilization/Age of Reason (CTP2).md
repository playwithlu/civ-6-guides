The {{LinkCTP2|Emancipation Act}} represents the genesis of a new regard for all humanity, by ending the pernicious institution of {{LinkCTP2|slavery}}.
Great Library entry.
Although many people have called the 18th century the Age of Reason, the phrase is misleading. Reason, and the exploration of rational thought, played a prominent role in many previous ages. What granted the 18th century, particularly in England and France, the title was the prevalence of two main impulses: reason and passion. The celebration of reason is evident in the pursuit of order, symmetry, decorum and scientific knowledge that permeated the times. The cultivation of passion gave rise to such things as philanthropy, religious fervor, intensification of personal relationships and an increase in interest in sentiment or sensibility. Reason evidences itself in the literature of the times that employed satire, wit, argument and plain prose. Passion, on the other hand, was expressed in sublime poetry and psychological novels. 
A combination of passion and reason was responsible for the criticism, and eventual vilification, of the institution of slavery.
