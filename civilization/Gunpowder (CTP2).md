Great Library entry.
Although black powder, also known as gunpowder, was thought to have originated in China, other evidence indicated that the Arabs were the first to develop it. By 1304, the Arabs had invented the first firearm, a bamboo tube reinforced with iron that shot an arrow with a charge of gunpowder. The Europeans adopted black powder for firearms use in the 14th and 15th centuries. It was not until the late 17th century that gunpowder was employed for use in explosives for peacetime applications, such as mining and road building, as well as war.
Black powder is comprised of the solid ingredients saltpeter (potassium nitrate), charcoal and sulfur. In the early days, manufacturers simply ground the ingredients together by hand with a mortar and pestle. In the 15th century, wooden stamps connected to water-driven mills could grind larger quantities faster. Power-driven metallic devices replaced these in the 19th century.
