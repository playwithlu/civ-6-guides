# American Revolution (Civ4)

"Not to be confused with "
The American Revolution is a [Scenario%20%28Civ4%29](scenario) in "[Civilization%20IV](Civilization IV)".
Gameplay.
You can play as the [American%20%28Civ4%29](Americans) or the [English%20%28Civ4%29](British). [Spanish%20%28Civ4%29](Spain) and [French%20%28Civ4%29](France) also appear as non-playable civilizations. The technology tree and religion are both disabled, making this a predominantly military scenario.
The British start out in control of Boston, Canada, Florida, and parts of the west. Like in other scenarios, events can occur in the game, such as British transports and troops arriving in Boston or two American [Caravel%20%28Civ4%29](Caravels) appearing in a city. The Americans have a scenario-specific conscription ability, which gives them several Militia units to counteract attacks when British forces appear close to an American city. Spain and France both play small roles in this scenario, as they both have only a single city to produce units and will not send troops to the front lines until the scenario is almost over.
Victory.
As in reality, there are only two ways to win: the player can either evict the British (or capture the American colonies) or wait for the British to surrender in time.
