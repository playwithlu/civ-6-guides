Game Info.
Requires: [Invention%20%28Civ2%29](Invention)
Obsolete With: [Automobile%20%28Civ2%29](Automobile)
Cost: 400 
Whenever a unit becomes obsolete because of new technology you have discovered, Leonardo's Workshop immediately replaces it with an equivalent (though not veteran) modern unit. When you acquire a city by bribery, any remaining units that are obsolete for you get upgraded immediately.
Note that players with veteran [Pikemen%20%28Civ2%29](Pikemen) (defense strength 6 against mounted units) may be concerned by their replacement by non-veteran [Musketeers%20%28Civ2%29](Musketeers) (strength 3). However, this is compensated for by Musketeers' 2 hit points to Pikemen's 1.
Leonardo's Workshop attempts to upgrade units each time a technology is discovered or acquired, even if the technology does not give a new unit. Upgrades do not happen at other times. For example, if a city or unit is bribed and the player thereby gains a [Chariot%20%28Civ2%29](Chariot), this will not be upgraded until the player's next discovery of a technology. Even if the player already has [Tactics%20%28Civ2%29](Tactics), it will take multiple discoveries to fully upgrade the Chariot to [Cavalry%20%28Civ2%29](Cavalry). The table below shows the upgrades that can be carried out before [Automobile%20%28Civ2%29](Automobile) is discovered and the Workshop becomes obsolete.
Civilopedia entry.
Leonardo da Vinci was one of the most celebrated painters of the Italian Renaissance. His most famous works include the "Mona Lisa" and "The Last Supper". Although best known for his art, da Vinci was also an accomplished observer and designer. Preserved in his sketch books are ideas for dozens of inventions, many of them centuries ahead of their time. These include designs for such devices as draw bridges, construction equipment, parachutes, and even helicopters. His scientific and technical drawings became the basis for the development of many of these modern devices.
