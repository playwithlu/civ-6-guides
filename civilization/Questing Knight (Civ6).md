It is exclusive to the [Heroes%20%26amp%3B%20Legends%20%28Civ6%29](Heroes &amp; Legends) [Game%20mode%20%28Civ6%29](game mode), introduced in the [Babylon%20Pack%20%28Civ6%29](Babylon Pack). It can only be created by having [Arthur%20%28Civ6%29](Arthur) use Arthur's Accolade on an adjacent land [Military%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](military unit).
Strategy.
A faithful follower of Arthur, the Questing Knight is not trained, but rather appointed to accompany its liege lord into battle. Though its Lifespan is limited and it cannot earn promotions, it is far stronger than the other units of its time and can easily turn the tide of a war.
A unit can move and attack immediately after being turned into a Questing Knight, even if it had already moved or attacked that turn. When its Lifespan runs out, however, the Questing Knight will disappear completely instead of turning back into the unit it originally was. This means Arthur's Accolade needs to be used with careful timing and consideration.
A Questing Knight has a base Combat Strength of 34 and gains additional Combat Strength based on the current game era, regardless of the era of the original unit, as shown in the table below.
