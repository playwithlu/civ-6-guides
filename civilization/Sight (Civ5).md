# Sight (Civ5)

Sight is an attribute of all [Unit%20%28Civ5%29](units) in "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)" and its expansions that allows them to observe activity in nearby tiles.
Mechanics.
Most units, with the exception of siege units, have a sight radius of 2. This means that they remove the [fog%20of%20war](fog of war) and can see all [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilizations'), [City-state%20%28Civ5%29](city-states'), and [Barbarian%20%28Civ5%29](Barbarian) units within 2 tiles of their position, as long as they have an unobstructed view of those tiles ("visibility" or "line of sight"). Line of sight can be blocked by [Hill%20%28Civ5%29](hills), [Forest%20%28Civ5%29](forests), [Jungle%20%28Civ5%29](jungles), and [Mountain%20%28Civ5%29](mountains); a unit situated on a hill will be able to see over all [Terrain%20%28Civ5%29](terrain) except mountains.
Ranged units must have line of sight to a target in order to attack it, unless they have the Indirect Fire [Promotions%20%28Civ5%29](promotion) (in which case they can attack any target within range as long as a friendly unit has line of sight to it). [City%20%28Civ5%29](Cities') lines of sight are not affected by terrain, so they can always attack enemy units within 2 tiles.
Sight Bonuses.
There are a few ways to increase the sight radii of units:
