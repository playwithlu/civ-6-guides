# Treaty (CTP2)

Gameplay.
A leader that wishes to make a standing agreement with another empire can include a Treaty in their diplomatic proposal. Some Treaties promote peace, some bolster {{LinkCTP2|Trade}} and {{LinkCTP2|Science}} and others propose a reduction in {{LinkCTP2|Pollution}}. Treaties can be included as the primary part of a proposal or in exchange for an {{LinkCTP2|Offer}} or {{LinkCTP2|Request}}.
Once two nations agree to a Treaty, it is in place forever, or until either nation violates its terms.
