# Obelisk (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Pairs of these large pillars of stone commonly flanked the entrances to temples in the Nile region. By the Second Millennium BCE they were associated with the sun god Ra (then eventually Amun, and finally Amun-Ra). Carving the obelisks as a single piece, transporting them, and finally lifting them into place were impressive feats of ancient engineering.
