# Air unit (SMAC)

Air units are special units. They have no terrain restrictions at all, but most have a limited range. Air units carry only enough fuel for two turns of operations. The unit must replenish its fuel every other turn at a friendly base or airbase, or it runs out of fuel. The unit's movement is displayed as a split number, for example, 12/24. The first number is the amount of moves remaining this turn, and the second number is the total movement available over two turns. A yellow or red split number indicates that this aircraft should be heading for a nearby base to avoid the risk of a crash. 
s are air units, but they don't run out of fuel. Instead, they need ongoing maintenance when in regular use. If a chopper does not end its turn in a base or airbase, it takes a small amount of damage. (Damage is repaired, over time, when the chopper is at a base or airbase.) This damage weakens the chopper in combat, and can result in the chopper falling apart and crashing, if allowed to continue too long without repairs in a base or airbase.
