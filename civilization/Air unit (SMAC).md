# Air unit (SMAC)

Air units are special units. They have no terrain restrictions at all, but most have a limited range. Air units carry only enough fuel for two turns of operations. The unit must replenish its fuel every other turn at a friendly base or airbase, or it runs out of fuel. The unit's movement is displayed as a split number, for example, 12/24. The first number is the amount of moves remaining this turn, and the second number is the total movement available over two turns. A yellow or red split number indicates that this aircraft should be heading for a nearby base to avoid the risk of a crash.
