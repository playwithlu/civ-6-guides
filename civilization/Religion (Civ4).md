# Religion (Civ4)

"[Civilization%20IV](Civilization IV)" has seven religions: Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and Taoism. They all have the same effects, differing only in what [List%20of%20technologies%20in%20Civ4](technologies) they require and the material needed to speed production of their [Cathedral%20%28Civ4%29](Cathedral) (see the table). Also, the later religions (Confucianism, Christianity, Taoism, and Islam) each get a free [Missionary%20%28Civ4%29](Missionary) in their holy city.
Founding of Religions and Holy Cities.
The first civ to discover the tech listed in the table above will found the given religion in one of its [City%20%28Civ4%29](cities). This city will then be the holy city of that religion, represented by a starred religious icon on the world view. The selection of the holy city from among all cities is partly random, but the algorithm will favor cities:
A holy city receives +5 (instead of the standard +1 ). A [Great%20Prophet%20%28Civ4%29](Great Prophet) may construct a [Religious%20shrine%20%28Civ4%29](religious shrine) in a religion's holy city. If a holy city is razed, then the religion will continue to exist (provided that it has spread to other cities), but the holy city will be gone for the remainder of the game.
Spread of Religion.
Religion can spread in two ways: via [Missionary%20%28Civ4%29](Missionaries), and automatically. Religions will only spread automatically to cities which do not have any religion present. Furthermore, automatic spread will happen only if there is trade access (not necessarily a trade route, but the potential for one) between the city and the holy city of some religion. Factors that increase the likelihood of automatic spread are low distance to the holy city, and the presence in the holy city of that religion's shrine.
Otherwise, spread of religion is done by way of Missionaries. Missionaries are units that civs may build in a city of a particular religion. The Missionary may then move to another city, and if its religion is not present there, attempt to spread its religion. The attempt to spread religion will automatically succeed if there is no religion present. For cities with one or more religions already present, there is a random chance that the Missionary will fail. This chance is about 9% per religion present for your own cities, or 12% for foreign cities:

State Religion.
When a civilization owns one or more cities containing any particular religion, the civ can choose to make that religion its state religion, which, like changing [List%20of%20civics%20in%20Civ4](civics), will result in temporary [Anarchy%20%28Civ4%29](anarchy) for [Leaders%20%28Civ4%29](leaders) who do not possess the [Spiritual%20%28Civ4%29](Spiritual) [Leader%20trait%20%28Civ4%29](leader trait) or the [Cristo%20Redentor%20%28Civ4%29](Cristo Redentor) world wonder. Adopting a state religion gives +1 to all cities containing that religion and allows access to the effects of religious civics.
