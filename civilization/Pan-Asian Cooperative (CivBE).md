# Pan-Asian Cooperative (CivBE)

&lt;includeonly&gt;
&lt;/includeonly&gt;
The Pan-Asian Cooperative (or PAC) is a civilization in the world of which represents the eastern Asian region. It is an industrial, political, and academic bloc consisting of the remains of eastern China, Vietnam, Mongolia, and a part of Korea.
Various details like their character-trait might be influenced by the socialist culture which is part of most of the cooperative's members.
The PAC is a production-oriented faction. They focus on Wonder production and fast worker improvements. They are lead by [Daoming%20Sochua%20%28CivBE%29](Daoming Sochua).
Pan-Asian Strategies.
Pan-Asia is the only faction with a general bonus in both improvement and Production. This allows them to complete [Wonders%20%28CivBE%29](Wonders) and [Tile%20improvement%20%28CivBE%29](tile improvements) faster than other civilizations, and if this specialty is monopolized, the player will be able to gain more advantages and resources at a faster rate.
It is suggested that the player research the technologies needed for a large amount of Wonders and improvements and then proceed to create them. Completing Wonders first will be less of a problem due to the faction's first specialty, so that the player can produce more if they do not fall behind the other civilizations. The completed Wonders can give powerful bonuses to improve the welfare of the entire faction. Of course, the fact that you got to those bonuses before, say, the Brazilians could won't hurt too much either.
Meanwhile, the player can also build droves of [Worker%20%28CivBE%29](Workers) to utilize the second advantage. These Workers can improve large numbers of tiles faster so that you gain more resources ( Energy, Food, Firaxite, etc.) than other civilizations, starting a feedback loop where the resulting resources can be used for gaining even more, which can then be invested in infrastructure projects (including Wonders), further powering the faction's growth.
In summary, Pan-Asia is one of the best factions at administration and is geared toward victories that require production of large numbers of buildings, Wonders, and units, such as the Transcendence, Domination, and Promised Land Victories.

Character Trait.
"Free" means that the wonder builds instantly. This only applies to normal wonders, not national wonders or ones unlocked via artifacts.
