Civilopedia entry.
Since the dawn of history, there has been a need for humans to investigate their surroundings and expand their knowledge of the world around them. Even the earliest civilizations sent people in search of wealth and resources in distant lands. With the advent of extensive sea travel, explorers such as Christopher Columbus and Amerigo Vespucci mapped and charted territories far from their homelands. These early explorers opened the New World to trade and colonization.
