# Ballista Elephant (Civ4)

The Ballista Elephant is the [Unique%20unit%20%28Civ4%29](unique unit) of the [Khmer%20%28Civ4%29](Khmer) [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ4](civilization).
Strategy.
Compared to the [War%20Elephant%20%28Civ4%29](War Elephant), which this unit replaces, the Ballista Elephant has the ability to attack [List%20of%20mounted%20units%20in%20Civ4](Mounted units) before any other unit in a stack, meaning it can remove unit counters and significantly weaken a stack. However, it can only use this ability outside of [City%20%28Civ4%29](cities).
