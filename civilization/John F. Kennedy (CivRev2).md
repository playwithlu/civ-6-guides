History.
John Fitzgerald Kennedy was the 35th President of the United States (January 1961 - November 1963). At the age of 43, he was the youngest person to ever be elected to the office. Prior to his time in The White House, JFK represented Massachusetts in both the U.S. House of Representatives (1947 - 1953) and the U.S. Senate (1953 - 1960). As President, he initiated Project Apollo, which would eventually lead to the moon landing. He also oversaw such crises as the Bay of Pigs Invasion and the Cuban Missile Crisis. On November 22, 1963, President Kennedy was assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald in Dallas, Texas. The FBI and the Warren Commission concluded that Oswald acted alone. However, conspiracy theories still surround the assassination to this very day.
