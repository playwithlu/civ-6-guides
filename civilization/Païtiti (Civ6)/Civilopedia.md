# Païtiti (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Humans, ever on the search for “lost cities,” particularly Lost Cities of Gold, tend to gravitate towards legends of great wealth and prosperity. Like most mystical cities, the prevailing thought is that Païtiti exists deep within the unknown wilds just waiting to be discovered. The Inca saw the city as the last safe haven from the Spanish Conquest. However, others (predominantly non-Incan explorers from the 1600s) perceived the city to be a treasure trove just waiting to be plundered. The legends of Païtiti’s wealth were perpetuated by the attack of Francisco Pizarro and his murder of Atahualpa, the last ruler of the Inca. He searched for the remaining gold said to exist, but Pizarro never received all of the alleged gold he tried so desperately to gain from his conquest. Despite multiple expeditions into the “unknown” jungles of the Amazon, no explorer has yet discovered the location of Païtiti.
