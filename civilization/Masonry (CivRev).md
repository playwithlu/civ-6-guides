# Masonry (CivRev)

Masonry allows the building of [walls%20%28CivRev%29](city walls). If the player's civilization discovers Masonry first, city walls are automatically built in the player's most important city, usually the [capital%20%28CivRev%29](capital).
Masonry also allows civilizations to collect [Marble%20%28CivRev%29](Marble) resources, as well as construct the [Great%20Wall%20%28CivRev%29](Great Wall), which allows them to demand peace from their enemies.
