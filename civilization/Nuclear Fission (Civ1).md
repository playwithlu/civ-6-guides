# Nuclear Fission (Civ1)

Nuclear Fission allows the building of [Manhattan%20Project%20%28Civ1%29](Manhattan Project), which allows the construction of [nuclear%20%28Civ1%29](nuclear) missiles in any civilization that has learned [Rocketry%20%28Civ1%29](rocketry).
It is a prerequisite of [Nuclear%20Power%20%28Civ1%29](nuclear power).
It negates the effects of the [Isaac%20Newton%27s%20College%20%28Civ1%29](Isaac Newton's College).
Civilopedia entry.
Nuclear Fission occurs when a fissionable atomic nucleus absorbs a neutron, becomes unstable, and splits into two new nuclei. In the process, tremendous energy is given off as heat, light, and radioactivity. The first use of Nuclear Fission was in warfare, where the heat and shock wave of uncontrolled fission produced an unprecedented weapon, the atomic bomb. Later, controlled Nuclear Fission was employed to provide enough heat to power the generation of electricity in a Nuclear Power Plant. The dangers and risks associated with Nuclear Power have so far limited its employment.
