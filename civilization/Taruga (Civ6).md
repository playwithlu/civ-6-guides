# Taruga (Civ6)

Taruga is a scientific [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-state) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It was added in the [Maya%20%26amp%3B%20Gran%20Colombia%20Pack%20%28Civ6%29](Maya &amp; Gran Colombia Pack).
Strategy.
The misleading wording of Taruga's Suzerainty bonus makes it sound like a really overpowered city-state, while in fact it is quite the opposite. Taruga does not grant an empire-wide bonus based on how many [Resource%20%28Civ6%29](Strategic Resources) you own, as that would be too powerful. Indeed, its is city-based. If a city has one type of Strategic Resource in its border, it will earn 5% extra , two types for 10% extra, etc. That also means if a city does not own any Strategic Resource, it is unaffected by this city-state.
Overall, the amount of bonus granted by this city-state is not as meaningful as its description may deceive you into believing. The earlier the bonus is, the more impactful that bonus will be, but in the early game you are limited by how many Strategic Resources you have revealed. Even as time goes on, it is incredibly rare to have a lot of cities with high diversity of Strategic Resources. Compared to [Geneva%20%28Civ6%29](Geneva), which gives 15% in peace time, every city in your empire is required to have 3 unique types of Strategic Resource, which is practically impossible. Theoretically, most cities only have 1 to 2 types, 3 is already very rare.
