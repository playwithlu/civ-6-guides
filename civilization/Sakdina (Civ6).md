# Sakdina (Civ6)

Sakdina is a [Golden%20Age%20%28Civ6%29](Golden Age) [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) from the [Dramatic%20Ages%20%28Civ6%29](Dramatic Ages) [Game%20mode%20%28Civ6%29](game mode) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is available from the [Renaissance%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Renaissance Era) to the [Modern%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Modern Era) and uses a Wildcard slot.
Strategy.
Normally, when a [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) of yours is losing [Loyalty%20%28Civ6%29](Loyalty) even with a [Governor%20%28Civ6%29](Governor), there are precious few options you have to save it. One of those ways is to emergency-build an [Entertainment%20Complex%20%28Civ6%29](Entertainment Complex) in said city and nearby ones, which unlocks the [Bread%20and%20Circuses%20%28Civ6%29](Bread and Circuses) [Project%20%28Civ6%29](project) and allows your Citizens to exert more Loyalty pressure.
With Sakdina active, you no longer need to build Entertainment Complexes to implement this strategy. All you need is to have completed a single specialty [District%20%28Civ6%29](district) in a city, and you will be able to run its corresponding project while enjoying the same Loyalty pressure bonuses as Bread and Circuses. If you have a neighbor with a vulnerable city you wish to try to [Loyalty%20%28Civ6%29%23Loyalty%20attack](flip), you can use the exact same strategy, as the Loyalty pressure works on foreign cities as well.
If you have other incentives to run district projects (e.g. are playing as [Brazilian%20%28Civ6%29](Brazil) and can run [Carnival%20%28Civ6%29](Carnival)), Sakdina allows you to derive a bit more value from them. Its window of availability, however, makes it inaccessible during the early game (when players often run [Holy%20Site%20Prayers%20%28Civ6%29](Holy Site Prayers) to earn a [Great%20Prophet%20%28Civ6%29](Great Prophet) and found a [Religion%20%28Civ6%29](religion) quickly) and the late game (when [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Science](Science Victory) seekers often run [Campus%20Research%20Grants%20%28Civ6%29](Campus Research Grants) in their cities repeatedly to wring out as much as possible).
