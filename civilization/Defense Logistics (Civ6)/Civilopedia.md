# Defense Logistics (Civ6)/Civilopedia

There is an old military saying: “Amateurs study strategy; experts study logistics.” An army can’t fight if it doesn’t have bullets or bread, so the steady supply of these things takes up a significant amount of a general’s time. Done well, even a small force can triumph. Done badly, and the war is over before it begins.
