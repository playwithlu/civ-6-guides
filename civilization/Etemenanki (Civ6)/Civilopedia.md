# Etemenanki (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Etemenanki was a Babylonian ziggurat or stepped tower. Some believe that Etemenanki may be the inspiration for the story of the Tower of Babel. It was originally constructed around the time of Hammurabi and restored by Nebuchadnezzar II after the destruction of Babylon in 689 BC. In 331 BC, Alexander the Great captured Babylon and once more ordered for Etemenanki to be repaired. When he returned to Babylon and found that the building hadnâ€™t changed, he decided it would be easier just to knock the whole thing down and start again. Alexander the Great died however before his orders could be fulfilled. Another prince allegedly wanted to rebuild the ziggurat, but after he embarrassed himself by tripping, he had his elephants knock the rest of it down in a temper tantrum.
