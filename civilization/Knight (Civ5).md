Strategy.
The Knight is a fast and powerful unit, the undisputed king of the medieval battlefield. It is the concept of medieval armor brought to the back of a horse - a mountain of steel plates and helmets waving a long sword and bringing its lance to bear against its enemies. The Knight retains the features of earlier mounted units, and is able to move after it attacks, allowing it to make holes in the enemy lines and then ride straight through them. Lightly-armored units can rarely withstand a Knight's charge, so units of the [Classical%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Classical Era) rarely stand a chance against them. [Pikeman%20%28Civ5%29](Pikemen), however, are deadly with their long weapons, so keep your Knights away from them!
