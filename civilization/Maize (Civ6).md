Strategy.
 Maize is the only -yielding resource that is improved with a [Farm%20%28Civ6%29](Farm). As such, it will help nearby [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) grow large and prosperous, especially since the [Terrain%20%28Civ6%29](terrain) on which it is found can naturally be improved with Farms that will receive [Adjacency%20bonus%20%28Civ6%29](adjacency bonuses) with [Feudalism%20%28Civ6%29](Feudalism) and [Replaceable%20Parts%20%28Civ6%29](Replaceable Parts).
