# Assault (CTP1)

Units can assault by attempting to move into the tile of the target unit. Assaulting units must have enough movement points to move into the target tile. Land and sea units end their turn after assaulting. Air units can assault and continue to move, but cannot assault twice in one turn. A city may lose 1 population when assaulted, and loses 1 population when captured.

The basic assault, engaging in combat, dates back to before recorded history. Although the methods and weapons employed have evolved from hand-to-hand melee to inter-atmospheric engagement, the motivation has always been the same: human aggression.
