Gameplay.
Alchemy allows the construction of the {{LinkCTP2|Fire Trireme}} unit. An improvement on the {{LinkCTP2|Coracle}}, the {{LinkCTP2|Fire Trireme}} is able to spray jets of liquid flame on enemy boats. The discovery of Alchemy makes the development of this primitive chemical weapon possible.
Great Library entry.
Alchemy was a science fused of many disparate sources, including Chinese, Egyptian and Islamic concepts that flowed into Western Europe via the Silk Road during the middle ages. The primary objective of alchemy was the discovery of a method to turn base metals into precious ones. Though this quest proved futile, its pursuit contributed to a deeper understanding of the nature and composition of many elements. Early metallurgy benefited from the results of alchemic experiments.
