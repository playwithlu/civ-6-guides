Civilopedia entry.
The Survival Dome remains a controversial subject among many systems. Eschewing the gradual education of the Academy of Knowledge or the strict discipline of the School of Zealots, the Survival Dome employs but one teacher - reality. How better to learn what sort of polymers can be used to filter lethal sulfur dioxide than to fill a room with it and give the student a book of carpet samples?
