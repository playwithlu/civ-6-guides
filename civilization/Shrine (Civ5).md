# Shrine (Civ5)

Game Info.
Basic religious building of the [Ancient%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Ancient Era).
Strategy.
The Shrine is added in "", the first expansion for "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)". It is the first -producing building, available very early (after researching [Pottery%20%28Civ5%29](Pottery)). Note that your empire doesn't normally produce any unless you settled next to a [Natural%20wonder%20%28Civ5%29](natural wonder) or are playing as the [Celtic%20%28Civ5%29](Celts), so you'll need to build Shrines and start accumulating early on if you want to found a [Religion%20%28Civ5%29](religion).
