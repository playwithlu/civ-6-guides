# Composite Bowman (Civ5)

Game Info.
Classical Er–∞ ranged unit. Upgrades from the [Archer%20%28Civ5%29](Archer).
Strategy.
The Composite Bowman is armed with an improved model bow, and thus much more powerful than the [Archer%20%28Civ5%29](Archer). It can deal significant damage to other units throughout the Classical and early Medieval Eras, after which developments in armor make him obsolete. Put Composite Bowmen in your city for defense, and guard them with melee units when on the move - they're vulnerable to melee attacks.
