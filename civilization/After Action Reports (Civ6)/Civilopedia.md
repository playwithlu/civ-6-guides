# After Action Reports (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Soldiers have historically reflected on their successes, and numerous examples of military histories written by participants can be found through history and across cultures. But the modern After-Action Report is a product of the increasing professionalism of the staff officer. The AAR is a formal affair, based on an analytical look at goals and objectives, the outcomes, and the recommendations for future action. After-Action Reports are a critical part of the modern officerâ€™s curriculum.
