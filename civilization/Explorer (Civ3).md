# Explorer (Civ3)

Explorers are unarmed, non-combat units that treat all terrain as if it were a [Road%20%28Civ3%29](road). This makes them very adept at exploring the wilderness.
Before , they were made available with [Navigation%20%28Civ3%29](Navigation). This change makes it possible to scout foreign shores much earlier since both the [Caravel%20%28Civ3%29](Caravel) and Explorer are made available at the same time. In either case, the Explorer is a unit of questionable value, since in most games it cannot be built until most of the map is already well-known. 
Variants.
The [Spanish%20%28Civ3%29](Spanish) cannot recruit Explorers, building instead the [Conquistador%20%28Civ3%29](Conquistador). These are proper military units with combat abilities that move just as fast as explorers.
