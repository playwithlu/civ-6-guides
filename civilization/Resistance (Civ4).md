# Resistance (Civ4)

Resistance , also known as revolt, is a state in which a [City%20%28Civ4%29](city's) inhabitants refuse to work. While resisting, the city produces no [Food%20%28Civ4%29](Food) , [Production%20%28Civ4%29](Production) , [Commerce%20%28Civ4%29](Commerce) , or any other products (including [Science%20%28Civ4%29](Science) , [Culture%20%28Civ4%29](Culture) , and [Espionage%20%28Civ4%29](Espionage Points) ). A city in resistance extends no Cultural borders . Finally, cities in resistance have no [Defense](Defense) bonus from population or culture, though they do retain from [List%20of%20buildings%20in%20Civ4](buildings) ([Walls%20%28Civ4%29](Walls), [Castle%20%28Civ4%29](Castle), and [Chichen%20Itza%20%28Civ4%29](Chichen Itza)).
Cities have a chance to go into resistance when under serious Cultural pressure by neighboring [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ4](civilizations). The first time a city goes into resistance due to cultural pressure, it will eventually return to the owner's control after a number of [turn](turn)s. However, if it goes into resistance a second time, it will "flip" to the control of the dominant civilization.
