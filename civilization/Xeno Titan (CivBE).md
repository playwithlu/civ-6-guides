Tier 1.
Xeno Titans appear at the beginning of the late game and are incredibly powerful. Their costs are high, contrasting typical Harmony units, but it has a very high Strength and can essentially kill almost any unit in the game at this stage. It is still vulnerable to Ranged attacks at this time so be sure to deal with them using orbital or high-range units.
Tier 2.
Tier 2 Xeno Titans receive incredible perks that assist it in durability, attack and siege alike. Its Strength is unparalleled and simply the highest that can be achieved in the game and it only receives half damage from ranged attacks. It also heals for a fifth of its health whenever killing an enemy unit. It is highly adaptable to the natural environment and with the right perks can also be a powerful siege unit, which when buffed by a Throne can one-shot any city in the game.
