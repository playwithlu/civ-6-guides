# Stockholm (Civ6)

Stockholm is a scientific [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-state) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Under rulesets in which [Swedish%20%28Civ6%29](Sweden) is a playable [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization), Stockholm becomes a [Swedish%20cities%20%28Civ6%29](Swedish city) and is replaced with [Bologna%20%28Civ6%29](Bologna).
Strategy.
Stockholm is a phenomenal city-state, considered by the community at large to be the strongest one in the entire game. To truly see how helpful its ability is, consider the [Oracle%20%28Civ6%29](Oracle), which is one of the best generalist [Wonder%20%28Civ6%29](wonders) overall. That wonder provides +2 points of each [District%20%28Civ6%29](district's) respective type in its home [City%20%28Civ6%29](city). This bonus provides that bonus, halved, in "every city" in your empire, and it's not a risky opportunity that opens up in the [Ancient%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Ancient Era), but a city-state bonus that a determined player can access at any time! Its bonus isn't even conditional to any specific [Victory%20%28Civ6%29](victory) path: the only victory that doesn't especially require is [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Religion](Religious Victory) (after they recruit a , of course), but Stockholm's bonus is so good for getting the best overall that seekers of that victory might as well aim for it anyway, unless there is an especially strong religious city-state like [Yerevan%20%28Civ6%29](Yerevan) they need more.
