# Moorehead Circle (Civ5)

World wonder in the [Conquest%20of%20the%20New%20World%20%28Civ5%29](Conquest of the New World Deluxe) [Scenario%20%28Civ5%29](scenario) of "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)". May only be constructed by Native Americans in a city on or next to [Grassland%20%28Civ5%29](grassland).
Strategy.
The Native American tribe that builds the Moorehead Circle wonder will be rewarded with a significant increase in {{Faith5}} generation and an early boost to its economy. Since [Religion%20%28Civ5%29](religion) is so useful to the Native Americans in this scenario, it is advisable for them to try to build the Moorehead Circle as soon as possible after settling a city in which it can be built.
