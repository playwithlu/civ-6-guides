New crop rotation techniques, better breeding methods and new mechanized devices for cultivation marked the period in the 18th century known as the agricultural revolution. Simultaneous advances in hygiene and diets led to a rise in population, and provided both workers and consumers for these new manufacturing methods. The Norfolk four-course system was one of the most important developments during this time. Wheat was grown in the first year, followed by turnips in the second, then barley, with clover and ryegrass undersown, in the third. The clover and ryegrass were grazed or cut for feed in the fourth year. Turnips went to feed cows and sheep. This system had enormous benefits, including the elimination of the fallow year, and richer, more abundant animal manure for fertilization. This increased crop yields considerably.
