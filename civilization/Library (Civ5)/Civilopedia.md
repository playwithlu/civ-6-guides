# Library (Civ5)/Civilopedia

A library is a building housing a collection of books, scrolls, and other written material. Historically, books have been fairly expensive, often beyond the reach of a civilization's poorer classes. The library allows the poor access to the same knowledge as the rich, greatly improving their chances of success and advancement.
