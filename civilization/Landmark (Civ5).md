Game Info.

Constructed by an [Archaeologist%20%28Civ5%29](Archaeologist) from an Archaeological Dig. ()
Strategy.
While the use of the Landmark is pretty straightforward in vanilla "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)" and ', it has some twists in '. Since you can no longer construct it just anywhere you decide, but only on the predetermined [Antiquity%20site%20%28Civ5%29](Antiquity Sites), you have to think before deciding what to do with each site. Keep in mind that a Landmark will only be useful to you if it's within your territory and close enough to a city to be worked; otherwise it's better to extract an Artifact from the Archaeological Dig.
What's more, when the dig is another civilization's territory, extracting an Artifact from it will lead to a diplomatic incident - they will rightfully insist that the Artifact belongs to them. On the other hand, if you build a Landmark in their territory (expending your Archaeologist), they will be grateful. This is also valid in the case of [City-state%20%28Civ5%29](City-States) - you will gain some Influence with them if you built a Landmark on their territory.
