History.
Sargon was the first ruler of the Akkadian Empire. Known historically as "Sargon of Akkad", he is remembered for conquering Sumerian City-States between 24th and 23rd Century B.C. He was also the founder of his unique dynasty, the "Sargonic Dynasty, "which ruled fiercely over most of Mesopotamia and the Levant for about 100 years after Sargon's death.
In 2135 B.C. the "Sargonic Dynasty "was finally diminished by the "Guterian Dynasty", after the sacking of Sumer.
