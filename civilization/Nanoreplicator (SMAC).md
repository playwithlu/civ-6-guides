# Nanoreplicator (SMAC)

 is a [base%20facility%20%28SMAC%29](base facility) in "[Sid%20Meier%27s%20Alpha%20Centauri](Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri)". 
Strategy.
Mineral output goes up by 50%. Also, mineral effect on ecodamage is reduced, as per centauri preserve and temple of planet. Note that the extra minerals tend to outstrip the reduced effect of mineral production if the other two facilities are already built (each building that lowers effects of mineral production on planet does less than the one before, due to the set-up of the eco-damage equation).
