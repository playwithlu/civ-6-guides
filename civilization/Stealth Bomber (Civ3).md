# Stealth Bomber (Civ3)

Stealth Bombers can do everything normal bombers can do and more. They can execute all air missions, except air superiority. Due to their stealth technology, stealth bombers are very difficult to intercept by enemy air superiority fighters, and/or SAM batteries.
A city must have oil and aluminum in its Strategic Resource to build a stealth bomber.
