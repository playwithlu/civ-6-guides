The Siamese people represent a [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilization) in "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)".
Strategy.
The Siamese are designed primarily for a [Diplomatic%20victory%20%28Civ5%29](diplomatic victory), especially when considering their [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ5%29](unique ability) and the intense relation with [City-state%20%28Civ5%29](city-states) that it encourages. This ability increases , , and from friendly and allied city-states. And what is less obvious, [Unit%20%28Civ5%29](units) gifted from militaristic city-states also start with an extra 10 [XP](XP) on top of the experience points given to that unit through [Barracks%20%28Civ5%29](Barracks)-line buildings in the city-state.
What's more interesting is the fact that the ability also allows for many other things, such as boost for speeding up the acquisition of [Social%20policies%20%28Civ5%29](social policies) (also defending against foreign cultural influence in ""), speeding up growth of [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities), and faster boom. This gives the Siamese the potential to pursue something other than a diplomatic victory, as long as they maintain good relationships with enough city-states. Adopt all the social policies in the [Patronage%20%28Civ5%29](Patronage) tree, and use the bonuses from your city-state allies to pursue any [Victory%20%28Civ5%29](victory) condition you choose!
