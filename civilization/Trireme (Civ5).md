# Trireme (Civ5)

Game Info.
First naval unit of the game, used to wrest control of the seas.
Strategy.
The Trireme is the first naval unit available to [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilizations) in the game. It depends on a combination of sails and oars to move, which gives it a decent speed, but makes it very unstable in open seas, and thus unable to traverse [Ocean%20%28Civ5%29](ocean) tiles. It is a melee unit with a modest Melee Combat Strength and thus only usable against other sea vessels, or in the utmost case to attack [Coastal%20%28Civ5%29](coastal) [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities).
The Trireme is useful for clearing [Barbarian%20%28Civ5%29](barbarian) ships out of home waters and also for early sea exploration along the [Coast%20%28Civ5%29](coast). Also, it could help at attacking and capturing enemy cities, but don't rely entirely on them - they're vulnerable to cities' ranged attacks, and to any ranged units firing at them from land.
