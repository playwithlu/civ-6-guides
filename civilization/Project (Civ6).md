# Project (Civ6)

In "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)" and its expansions, a project can be undertaken in the queue of a [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) to provide some sort of benefit which doesn't include creating a permanent feature like a [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](unit), [Building%20%28Civ6%29](building), or .
There are three main types of projects:
The various types of projects and their effects are listed [List%20of%20projects%20in%20Civ6](here).
Great People points yield formula for district projects.
While the district project cost scales with [Speed%20%28Civ6%29](game speed), the points yield does not (which is most likely an oversight, since the cost of recruiting a scales with game speed). For example, [Campus%20Research%20Grants%20%28Civ6%29](Campus Research Grants) converts approximately 22% of the invested to points on Standard speed, but less than 15% on Epic speed (even though the project cost is 50% higher). This means that district projects are more efficient for Online and Quick speeds and less efficient for Epic and Marathon speeds.
