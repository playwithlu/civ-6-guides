Although research into nuclear fusion began in the 1950s, it was not until the end of the 20th century that scientists began to have success with creating fusion reactors. Whereas nuclear fission reactions occur when particles split atoms, fusion reactions occur when two lighter atomic nuclei combine to form a heavier element. The nuclei must be moving at high speed in order to overcome their mutual electrical repulsion. When these nuclei fuse, a small amount of mass is converted into a large amount of energy. Late 20th century designs of fusion reactors relied on extremely hot, dense plasma, i.e. an ionized gas consisting of free nuclei and free electrons, used to impart the high speeds of the nuclei. Deuterium and tritium nuclei, the easiest nuclei to fuse, provided the fuel for the reactor.
