The Crawler is the unit-of-choice in underwater combat. As its name implies, it crawls the ocean floor, enabling one to attack Undersea Colonies with land-based units. Though it has no attack capabilities of its own, it is a stubborn defender.
Great Library entry.
Using the same technology developed for constructing deep-water undersea colonies and deep-sea mining operations, military scientists developed a craft that could transport armed forces through the benthos. Because it skims the ocean surface, keeping an extremely low sonar and radar signature, it earned the nickname "crawler." Although it saw limited civilian use, the crawler became the transport unit of choice for stealth operations because it lacked the vulnerability of air, land and ocean-surface transport. Its ability to invade underwater cities also made it indispensable for undersea raids.
