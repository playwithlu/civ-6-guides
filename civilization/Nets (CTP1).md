Gameplay.
Nets are ocean-based tile improvements that create an additional 5-15 food when worked. Depending on the terrain, this improvement costs 200-400 PW and takes two turns to build. 
Great Library entry.
Fishing began as a highly inefficient means of gathering food. Fisherman soon learned to employ nets to capture dozens of fish per day. Early nets fitted twine or hemp around a support frame of wood.
