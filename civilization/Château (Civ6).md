# Château (Civ6)

The Château is a unique of the [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It must be built adjacent to a [Resource%20%28Civ6%29%23Bonus](Bonus) or a [Resource%20%28Civ6%29%23Luxury](Luxury Resource). 
Strategy.
The Château has improved greatly since the [Civilization%20VI%20April%202021%20Update](April 2021 Update) but still manages to be somewhat underwhelming as a unique improvement. It is stuck in a spot similar to other improvements with lax restrictions: it can be built almost anywhere, but going overboard with it can stunt the city's growth and productivity, as it provides no , , or . The arrival of this improvement complicates the matter even further, since it is unlocked around the same time France needs to focus on to make use of their civilization ability.
The Château functions similarly to the [Sphinx%20%28Civ6%29](Sphinx): both provide , , and [Appeal%20%28Civ6%29](Appeal) bonuses, can be built on most [Terrain%20%28Civ6%29](terrain) (including [Floodplains%20%28Civ6%29](Floodplains)), can't be built adjacent to an identical improvement, and get bonuses from adjacent [Wonder%20%28Civ6%29](wonders). The Château, however, is unlocked later than the Sphinx, provides 1 less Appeal in "", provides rather than , and has resource-adjacency restriction, but has multiple wonder-adjacency bonus like a [Theater%20Square%20%28Civ6%29](Theater Square) and provides more and , which works better towards a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Cultural Victory). Magnificence Catherine is a little better at using this improvement since all her improved luxury resources next to a Château will receive 2 ; however, the catch here is that Magnificence Catherine's expensive unique [Project%20%28Civ6%29](project) makes her even more -hungry than Black Queen Catherine or Eleanor, so she has even more things to consider when deciding if it is wise to fill all empty tiles with Châteaux.
Later in the game when is easy to come by (and especially after unlocking [Flight%20%28Civ6%29](Flight)), the Château is worth building on any tile with both a resource and either a wonder or River. However, it isn't strong enough to win a game on its own - you will need to focus on France's other bonuses for that.
