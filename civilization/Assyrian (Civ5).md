# Assyrian (Civ5)

The Assyrian people represent a [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilization) in "".
Strategy.
The Assyrians are designed for a [Domination%20victory%20%28Civ5%29](domination victory). Along with the [Hunnic%20%28Civ5%29](Huns), they have one of the most powerful early game siege engines, and although it appears later than the [Battering%20Ram%20%28Civ5%29](Battering Ram), the [Siege%20Tower%20%28Civ5%29](Siege Tower) is arguably more effective because of the additional bonus against [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities) it confers to nearby [Unit%20%28Civ5%29](units).
To take advantage of the Siege Tower, research [Archery%20%28Civ5%29](Archery) relatively early and build 6+ [Archer%20%28Civ5%29](Archers) after founding your second city, but before building [Building%20%28Civ5%29](buildings). By building early trade units, selling embassies, or clearing [Barbarian%20%28Civ5%29](barbarian) [Encampment%20%28Civ5%29](encampments), you can gain enough to upgrade them once you research [Construction%20%28Civ5%29](Construction) after [Mathematics%20%28Civ5%29](Mathematics). Six [Composite%20Bowman%20%28Civ5%29](Composite Bowmen) and two Siege Towers are more than enough to take down an enemy before turn 100 on Standard [Speed%20%28Civ5%29](speed), especially if it's surrounded by flat [Terrain%20%28Civ5%29](terrain).
The Assyrians' [Unique%20building%20%28Civ5%29](unique building), the [Royal%20Library%20%28Civ5%29](Royal Library), also confers them a military advantage in the middle and late game, thanks to the special [XP](XP) bonus for units trained in a city with this building, provided you have filled the slot in it with a [Great%20Work%20%28Civ5%29](Great Work of Writing). The additional slot for Great Works also gives the Assyrians a slight edge toward a [Cultural%20victory%20%28Civ5%29](cultural victory), should they choose to pursue one.
Finally, their [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ5%29](unique ability) allows them to steal [List%20of%20technologies%20in%20Civ5](technologies) when conquering cities! This allows them to either catch up with their rivals or keep ahead in military technology throughout the game. Simply target a rival who has more Victory Points from Technology than you (which you can check with the tooltips in the Diplomacy screen), and quickly acquire all that he or she has discovered and you have not!
