Civilopedia entry.
The Apollo Program was begun by the United States in response to early Soviet successes in space, and was intended to place men on the Moon. This was dramatically accomplished on July 20, 1969, when two American astronauts first set foot on the lunar landscape. Technology developed for the Apollo Program was later found to be invaluable in designing future space vehicles and orbital platforms.
