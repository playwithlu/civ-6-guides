# International Waters (Civ6)

International Waters is a Military [Policy%20Cards%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
International Waters is the final policy that accelerates [Naval%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](naval unit) production. Only the [Aircraft%20Carrier%20%28Civ6%29](Aircraft Carrier) doesn't benefit from it - every other late-game naval unit, including the [German%20%28Civ6%29](Germans') [U-Boat%20%28Civ6%29](U-Boat), does, making it a boon to players who need to build a large navy in a hurry.
