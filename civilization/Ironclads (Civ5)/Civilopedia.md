# Ironclads (Civ5)/Civilopedia

In an attempt to break the Union blockade, the Confederacy was the first in the Civil War to turn to constructing an ironclad; in October 1861 the CSS Manassas became the first ironclad to enter combat, engaging Union warships in the Battle of the Head of Passes - a battle overshadowed by the first ironclad clash between the CSS Merrimack and the USS Monitor the following February.
