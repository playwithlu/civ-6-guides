Effect.
Television provides a city with +5 gold per citizen, besieging the public with advertisements for useless, yet somehow extremely desirable products.

Great Library entry.
In 1939, at the New York World's Fair, RCA set up a special exhibit: a bulky radio box that showed pictures synched to the sound. By 1960, TV had broken the power of the motion picture industry. Beyond entertainment, TV brought images of the world into the living room. For example, on March 7, 1965 scenes from Selma, Alabama showed police assaulting the civil rights marchers. Horrified by the images, Congress passed the Civil Rights Bill. The power of TV had been confirmed.
