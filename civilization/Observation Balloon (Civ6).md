# Observation Balloon (Civ6)

The Observation Balloon is a {{Link6|Modern Era}} [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Support](support unit) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
In the "" expansion, the Observation Balloon can upgrade to a [Drone%20%28Civ6%29](Drone).
Strategy.
The Observation Balloon becomes available around the same time as the [Artillery%20%28Civ6%29](Artillery), which it complements very nicely on the battlefield. With an Observation Balloon spotting for them, they can bombard a [City%20%28Civ6%29](city's) defenses from outside its attack range until melee and cavalry units are ready to move in and capture it.
Should you face enemy [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Siege](siege units) supported by an Observation Balloon, [Biplane%20%28Civ6%29](Biplanes) will be able to destroy them with ease. If you don't have Biplanes, use [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Light%20cavalry](light cavalry units) (preferably with [Spiking%20the%20Guns%20%28Civ6%29](Spiking the Guns)) for surgical strikes against the siege weapons - even if you lose them, it's worth saving your city.
