# Alpine Mountain (CTP2)

Alpine Mountains are a type of [Terrain%20%28CTP2%29](terrain) in "[Call%20to%20Power%20II](Call to Power II)". [Tea%20%28CTP2%29](Tea) and [Emeralds%20%28CTP2%29](Emeralds) can be found here.
Gameplay.
Mountains make up for their lack of a {{LinkCTP2|Food}} with substantial levels of {{LinkCTP2|Production}} and fair amounts of {{LinkCTP2|Commerce}}. Mountains are good places to build well-fortified {{LinkCTP2|Cities}}, as the {{LinkCTP2|Defense}} bonus to units is considerable. Movement without {{LinkCTP2|Roads}} is extremely slow, though road construction is very expensive. One can build {{LinkCTP2|Mines}}, but not {{LinkCTP2|Farms}} or Commerce Improvements.
The discovery of {{LinkCTP2|Fusion}} enables {{LinkCTP2|Terraforming}} Mountains.
