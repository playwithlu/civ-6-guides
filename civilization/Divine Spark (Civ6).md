# Divine Spark (Civ6)

Divine Spark is a [Pantheons%20%28Civ6%29](pantheon) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It provides +1 point for each [Holy%20Site%20%28Civ6%29](Holy Site), +1 point for each [Campus%20%28Civ6%29](Campus), and +1 point for each [Theater%20Square%20%28Civ6%29](Theater Square). In "", it was altered so that Campuses will provide points only if they have a [Library%20%28Civ6%29](Library) and Theater Squares will provide points only if they have an [Amphitheater%20%28Civ6%29](Amphitheater).
Strategy.
Although Divine Spark gives bonus points to three different types of , the most important of them is the invaluable point to help you secure a [Religion%20%28Civ6%29](religion). This pantheon is particularly great for [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) that have bonuses tied to religions yet no mechanism for helping them secure one (such as [Georgian%20%28Civ6%29](Georgia) and [Spanish%20%28Civ6%29](Spain)), or in any game where you want to found a religion without having any aids on that quest.Â However, getting a [Great%20Prophet%20%28Civ6%29](Great Prophet) is very difficult on higher [Difficulty%20level%20%28Civ6%29](difficulty levels) due to the [AI](AI) bonuses, so this aspect can be less useful if you're already struggling. Of course, the bonus points towards [Great%20Writer%20%28Civ6%29](Great Writers) and [Great%20Scientist%20%28Civ6%29](Great Scientists) also help players who aim for a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Cultural) or [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Science](Scientific Victory), but since these players will most likely mass-produce Campuses and Theater Squares anyway, this pantheon won't feel as effective.
