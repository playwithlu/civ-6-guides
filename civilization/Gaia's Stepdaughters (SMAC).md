Faction characteristics.
Although Deirdre is not restricted from using the Planned economics choice, an [AI](AI)-controlled Deirdre will take offense at a player's choice of such.
Leader's defining quote.
In the great commons at Gaia's Landing we have a tall and particularly beautiful stand of white pine, planted at the time of the first colonies. It represents our promise to the people, and to Planet itself, never to repeat the tragedy of Earth.
