# Envoy (Civ6)

The {{EnvoyIcon6}} Envoy is a diplomatic representative of your [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) that acts as your agent in [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-states) that you've met. It is the focus of the brand new City-State Influence system in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)", which is suited to all the major changes which happened in this aspect of the game. 
Earning Envoys.
There are many ways to earn {{EnvoyIcon6}} Envoys:
Most of the above ways to earn {{EnvoyIcon6}} Envoys provide you with "free use" agents, which you can then assign as you please; the only exceptions being meeting a city-state first, performing a quest for a city-state and liberating a city-state. Both of these will earn {{EnvoyIcon6}} Envoys directly with the city-state in question.
Using Envoys.
After earning an {{EnvoyIcon6}} Envoy, you will receive a prompt to choose which city-state to send it to. This is done in the City-States tab, where you will see buttons next to each city-state with which to increase (or decrease) the number of your {{EnvoyIcon6}} Envoys there. If you have multiple {{EnvoyIcon6}} Envoys available, you may divide them between city-states as you wish. You may choose also to delay their assignment if you have no immediate use for them - just go out of the City-State window without assigning {{EnvoyIcon6}} Envoys.
The type bonuses earned from city-states are based on how many {{EnvoyIcon6}} Envoys you have present, regardless of who else has {{EnvoyIcon6}} Envoys there. City-states of a type all share the same type of bonuses. They are cumulative, so that as a player places more and more {{EnvoyIcon6}} Envoys on a city-state, they stack with the bonuses from before. For more information on what exactly the benefits of {{EnvoyIcon6}} Envoys are, head [City-state%20%28Civ6%29%23Relations%20Degrees](here).
Losing Envoys.
There are several gameplay situations in which you will lose your {{EnvoyIcon6}} Envoys with a certain city-state. Declaring war directly on a city-state removes all {{EnvoyIcon6}} Envoys you had there; the same also happens if the city-state loses its independence (i.e., gets conquered by another civilization). Otherwise, {{EnvoyIcon6}} Envoys stay in the city-state permanently. Being drawn into war with a city-state due to warring with its Suzerain does not remove your {{EnvoyIcon6}} Envoys. What's more, you're still able to assign {{EnvoyIcon6}} Envoys there. This interesting state of affairs actually makes it possible for you to "flip" a city-state's allegiance in the middle of a war. If you assign or otherwise gain enough {{EnvoyIcon6}} Envoys to at least equal its current Suzerain's number of {{EnvoyIcon6}} Envoys, that nation will immediately lose its Suzerain status, and the city-state will make peace with you automatically. This is actually worth a [Historic%20Moments%20%28Civ6%29](Historic Moment).
In "Rise and Fall", [Spy%20%28Civ6%29](Spies) can remove other civilizations' {{EnvoyIcon6}} Envoys from a city-state if they succeed at a Fabricate Scandal mission.
