Strategy.
The Mandekalu Cavalry is very similar to the normal Knight, with the exception of the penalty against [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities), which is removed. It also requires less to build. Thus, the Songhai are able to stage lightning assaults against cities during the [Medieval%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Medieval Era), which are very difficult to counter. Explore the enemy's weak spots, attacking the cities they aren't defending, using the superior speed of the Mandekalu Cavalry - they won't have time to react!
