The Monarchy developed from the absolute rule of the prehistoric tribal chief. This type of absolutism evolved first into a hereditary and lifelong right to rule, and was later claimed as a divine right. The Monarchy was made possible by the enforcement of LAWS put in place by the rulers and their supporters who had the most to gain from maintaining control. It was more practical than the despotism it often replaced because the ruler's power was not absolute and arbitrary, but generally dispensed through an aristocratic class of local rulers. The aristocrats served as a check on the ruler's power, blocking projects not in their own interest.
