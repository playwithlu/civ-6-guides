# Great Heathen Army (Civ6)/Civilopedia

In the year 865, thousands of Vikings landed in East Anglia, supposedly led by three vengeful sons of the legendary Ragnar Lodbrok. This “Great Heathen Army” stomped across England, taking what it could and breaking what it couldn't. The Anglo-Saxon King Alfred, known to history as Alfred the Great, finally brought the Great Heathen Army to defeat in 878. It wasn't all bad news for the Vikings, however—the treaty that followed gave much of northern and eastern England over to Viking rule.
