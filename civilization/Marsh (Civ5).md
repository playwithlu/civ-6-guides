# Marsh (Civ5)

A Marsh is a type of [Terrain%20%28Civ5%29%23Terrain%20Features](terrain feature) in "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)".
Game Info.
Terrain feature found on [Grassland%20%28Civ5%29](Grasslands).
Strategy.
Marsh tiles can't be used for anything and limit [Movement%20%28Civ5%29](movement) without providing cover during battle, imposing a 15% penalty to [Unit%20%28Civ5%29](units') Combat Strength. In most cases, players should drain Marshes in their [Territory%20%28Civ5%29](territory) (which clears the Marsh from the tile and turns the terrain into basic Grassland) as soon as they research [Masonry%20%28Civ5%29](Masonry). [Dutch%20%28Civ5%29](Dutch) players, however, have a unique ability to build the [Polder%20%28Civ5%29](Polder), an [List%20of%20improvements%20in%20Civ5](improvement) which increases the yields of a Marsh tile to +2 (and later +1 and +2 , when they've researched [Economics%20%28Civ5%29](Economics)) without having to clear it. It's highly beneficial for them to keep the Marshes so that they can be used later!
