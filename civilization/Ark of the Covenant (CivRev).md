Civilopedia entry.
According to legends, the original Ten Commandments, as dictated to Moses by God, were placed in a great chest that became known as the Ark of the Covenant. The Ark was said to have fantastic powers. In the battle at Jericho, the Ark was carried around the city for six days, while priests blew rams horns and shouted. On the seventh day, the impenetrable walls of Jericho simply collapsed, bringing immediate victory to the Ark's bearers.
