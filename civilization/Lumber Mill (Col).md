# Lumber Mill (Col)

A Lumber mill is the upgraded version of the [Carpenter%27s%20Shop%20%28Col%29](Carpenter's Shop). It is a workplace where [Lumber%20%28Col%29](Lumber) is converted into [Hammer%20%28Col%29](Hammers) -- one of the virtual [goods](goods) used to indicate progress toward the construction of new buildings or military units.
A Lumber mill requires a population of 3, and 52 Hammers, to build. An unskilled worker in a Lumber mill converts 6 units of Lumber to 6 Hammers per turn. A [Master%20Carpenters%20%28Col%29](Master Carpenter) doubles this.
There is no upgrade of the Lumber mill.
