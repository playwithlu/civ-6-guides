# Soft Targets (Civ6)/Civilopedia

A disciplined military – one that does not loot or pillage indiscriminately – is a hallmark of a well-running society. But in a Dark Age, standards might lapse. In a military that favors soft, civilian targets and sees plunder as a part of an individual soldier’s pay, soldiers might favor pursuing easily carried-off loot over militarily strategic goals. Such behavior might lead to increased damage to cities and civilians, but decreased efficacy in war.
