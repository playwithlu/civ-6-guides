# Merchant Confederation (Civ6)

Merchant Confederation is a Diplomatic [Policy%20Cards%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
This is the next Diplomatic Policy in the game and a very efficient way to make extra . It grants +1 for each you have, regardless of your status with a particular [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-state) - you can even be at war with it, and you'll still receive the ! At the time it becomes available, you should have 10+ s, and possibly many more (if you went with the right Policies); towards the end of the game you can reasonably expect more than 40 out of this Policy.
The only problem with Merchant Confederation is the problem with all Diplomatic Policies: you usually have only a single designated slot for them in your [Government%20%28Civ6%29](government). (The only ones with 2 Diplomatic slots are [Democracy%20%28Civ6%29](Democracy) and [Digital%20Democracy%20%28Civ6%29](Digital Democracy), which aren't available until late in the game.) So to use Merchant Confederation, you will have to give up the use of, say, a useful "permanent" Policy such as [Charismatic%20Leader%20%28Civ6%29](Charismatic Leader) or [Machiavellianism%20%28Civ6%29](Machiavellianism). And while there are many other ways to earn extra , finding other ways to earn the bonuses which these two will give you is very difficult.
