# Konstanty Korniakt (Civ6)/Civilopedia

The Greek Konstanty Korniakt came to Poland early in life, and has proven an able and capable merchant. His trade is international in nature, and he has even managed to secure routes with the Ottoman Empire. Sigismund II trusts Konstanty's acumen enough to collect royal tolls on the king's behalf.
