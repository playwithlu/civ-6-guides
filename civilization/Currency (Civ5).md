# Currency (Civ5)

Game Info.
The development of Currency, a single consolidated trading system based on one matrix material against which all others are judged, lays the cornerstones for contemporary trade. Thanks to this technology, the limitations and confusions of the bartering system are overcome, allowing standardized transactions which can serve not only in a single village, but also across international borders. It enables you to construct the first -enhancing buildings in the game, the [Market%20%28Civ5%29](Market) and the [Mint%20%28Civ5%29](Mint).
