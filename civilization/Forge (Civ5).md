# Forge (Civ5)

Game Info.
Bonus building. Can only be constructed in [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities) with at least one improved {{Iron5}} [Resources%20%28Civ5%29](resource) nearby.
Strategy.
The Forge is a great bonus building, not only increasing {{Production5}} on the {{Iron5}} resources nearby, but also boosting land unit production in the city. Use that to turn the city into a major army training hub!
