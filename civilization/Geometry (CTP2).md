Gameplay.
The discovery of Geometry makes long-range a possibility in combat. The ability to calculate trajectories is crucial to the success of siege weapons, and the is the result of this scientific discovery.
Great Library entry.
Beginning in 3500 BC, humanity developed a system of counting to track business deals and to measure land. By the middle of the third millennium BC, the Egyptians could calculate the area and volume of simple geometric shapes using a base-10 numbering system. This laid the foundation for geometry. With geometry, the Greeks revolutionized mathematics. This conceptual approach - with its postulates, proofs, and theorems - provided a foundation for logic and argument for the next two thousand years.
