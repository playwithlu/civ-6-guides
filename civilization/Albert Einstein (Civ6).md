Strategy.
Considered the best {{GreatPerson6}} in the game, Einstein provides a great bonus for your [Campus%20%28Civ6%29](Campuses). His great value, however, may make him hard to recruit, especially in [Multiplayer%20%28Civ6%29](multiplayer) games. If you aren't already generating a lot of {{Scientist6}} points, save up {{Gold6}} and/or {{Faith6}} to patronize him.
