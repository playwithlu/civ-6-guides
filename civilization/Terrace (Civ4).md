# Terrace (Civ4)

The Terrace is the [Unique%20building%20%28Civ4%29](unique building) of the [Incan%20%28Civ4%29](Inca).
Strategy.
Compared to the [Granary%20%28Civ4%29](Granary) which it replaces, the Terrace provides +2 [Culture%20%28Civ4%29](Culture) . 
The Granary/Terrace are critical for the quick [Population%20%28Civ4%29](growth) of cities, as they essentially double cities' growth rate, given enough -producing tiles are available. The [Whipping%20%28Civ4%29](whipping) mechanic of [Slavery%20%28Civ4%29](Slavery) essentially constitutes an efficient conversion of Food to Production , at the expense of producing . Additionally, the Granary/Terrace give +1 to grain resources, making it the earliest -multiplying building in the game. Therefore, it is advisable to build Granaries/Terraces in most every city, at some point.
Due to the Granary being such critical infrastructure, the Incan player will be building Terraces in most every city. As the Terrace gives +2 , the Incan player can forgo the [Monument%20%28Civ4%29](Monument) to gain early culture and pop out the city radius; this saves valuable early [Production%20%28Civ4%29](Hammers). As each city gets +2 in the course of normal play, this is effectively equivalent to playing as a [Creative%20%28Civ4%29](Creative) leader. Consequently, [Huayna%20Capac%20%28Civ4%29](Huayna Capac) can almost be considered as having "three" traits: [Financial%20%28Civ4%29](Financial), [Industrious%20%28Civ4%29](Industrious), "and" [Creative%20%28Civ4%29](Creative).
