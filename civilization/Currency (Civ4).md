Strategy.
Currency adds +1 trade routes per city and allows you to construct the [Market%20%28Civ4%29](Market) and [Grocer%20%28Civ4%29](Grocer) (with [Guilds%20%28Civ4%29](Guilds)) city improvements. It also enables you to build Wealth in cities and to trade gold with other civs.
Currency is an advance greatly important to early financial gain. The trade route will often be the first one players get in cities (adding to commerce), and Markets add to both cash and happiness - ideal for Holy Cities.
