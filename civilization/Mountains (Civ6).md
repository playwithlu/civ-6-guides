# Mountains (Civ6)

Mountains are a [Terrain%20%28Civ6%29](base terrain) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". They are found on all types of land [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles). Many Mountains stand alone, but they usually form ranges that cover up to several dozen tiles.
Mountains are an unusable terrain. They contain no [Resource%20%28Civ6%29](resources) or other features of any kind, though mountain ranges often appear at the head of a [River%20%28Civ6%29](River). [District%20%28Civ6%29](Districts) and [Wonder%20%28Civ6%29](wonders) (except for [Machu%20Picchu%20%28Civ6%29](Machu Picchu)) cannot be placed on Mountains tiles.
Strategy.
Mountains are valuable terrains, as not only do they provide a defensive bulwark but also provide [Adjacency%20bonus%20%28Civ6%29](adjacency bonuses) to the [Campus%20%28Civ6%29](Campus) and [Holy%20Site%20%28Civ6%29](Holy Site) districts. Building them in "valleys" surrounded by Mountains may boost their performance right from the start.
But even more importantly, Mountains may be used as a source of [Fresh%20water%20%28Civ6%29](Fresh Water) with the [Aqueduct%20%28Civ6%29](Aqueduct) district! You just need to found your [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) close enough (within 2 tiles of a Mountain), and as soon as you manage to build the Aqueduct it will enjoy the full {{Housing6}} bonus provided by bodies of water such as [River%20%28Civ6%29](Rivers) and [Lake%20%28Civ6%29](Lakes).
Mountains themselves are a base terrain that is neither land nor water, and all of them, despite differences in appearance depending on their surrounding terrain, are functionally identical. Therefore, a Mountain spawned in [Desert%20%28Civ6%29](Desert) areas is not counted as Desert and does not interact with [Malian%20%28Civ6%29](Mali's) [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](civ ability), a Mountain in [Tundra%20%28Civ6%29](Tundra)/[Snow%20%28Civ6%29](Snow) does not provide the [Ice%20Hockey%20Rink%20%28Civ6%29](Ice Hockey Rink) extra {{Culture6}}, a Mountain in Snow does not count as a Snow tile for the purpose of doubling the [Amundsen-Scott%20Research%20Station%20%28Civ6%29](Amundsen-Scott Research Station's) bonuses, and a Mountain does not count as an adjacent land tile when building [Polder%20%28Civ6%29](Polders) as the [Dutch%20%28Civ6%29](Dutch). With similar logic, Mountains in Desert or Tundra areas only grant a +1 {{Faith6}} adjacency bonus to Holy Sites, even if you have the [Desert%20Folklore%20%28Civ6%29](Desert Folklore) or [Dance%20of%20the%20Aurora%20%28Civ6%29](Dance of the Aurora) [Pantheon%20%28Civ6%29](pantheon), since the tile itself doesn't count as Desert or Tundra.
Finally, Mountains have a base Appeal of 4 and grant +1 Appeal to adjacent tiles, making them ideal to include in [National%20Park%20%28Civ6%29](National Parks). Appeal bonuses or penalties from adjacent terrain, districts, and tile improvements (such as [Woods%20%28Civ6%29](Woods), [Entertainment%20Complex%20%28Civ6%29](Entertainment Complexes), and [Mine%20%28Civ6%29](Mines)) do not affect Mountains, but the bonuses provided by the [Eiffel%20Tower%20%28Civ6%29](Eiffel Tower), the [Golden%20Gate%20Bridge%20%28Civ6%29](Golden Gate Bridge), and the [Great%20Engineer%20%28Civ6%29](Great Engineers) [Alvar%20Aalto%20%28Civ6%29](Alvar Aalto) and [Charles%20Correa%20%28Civ6%29](Charles Correa) do serve to increase Mountains' Appeal. The [Incan%20%28Civ6%29](Inca), being able to work Mountains, can make good use of their innate Appeal by choosing the [Earth%20Goddess%20%28Civ6%29](Earth Goddess) pantheon or building a [Preserve%20%28Civ6%29](Preserve) next to them.
Mountain range names.
"" introduced a new mechanic in which Mountains can have different names based on the first [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) that finds them. Below is the list of the names and civilization of origin, all named after real mountain ranges.
