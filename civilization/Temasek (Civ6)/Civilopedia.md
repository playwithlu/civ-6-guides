# Temasek (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Temasek fall under the sway of several rulers (and their religions). The Majapahit and Siam took control of the region in succession, bringing Buddhism with them. 'Malay Annals' tells us that in 1409, King Paramesvara would take control, converting to Islam, and the Malay peninsula with him.
