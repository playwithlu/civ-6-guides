Civilopedia entry.
The technology of Flight advanced rapidly in the 20th Century, especially during the two World Wars when the contending nations raced against each other for air superiority. Advanced Flight technology was a specialty of the Germans in World War II. They developed the first practical jet fighters, extremely long-ranged Bombers, and the first guided rockets. However, these innovations could not be produced in sufficient quantities to be really useful. The Allies mass-produced less innovative, but dependable, aircraft that won the air war.
