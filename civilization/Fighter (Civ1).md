Civilopedia entry.
The first military aircraft were used primarily in a reconnaissance role, but it wasn't long before guns were put on the planes and the Fighter was born. The Fighter's purpose was to shoot down other airplanes, especially Bombers and reconnaissance aircraft. In addition, the destruction of enemy Fighter units was the best way to insure that friendly Bombers and scouts survived to reach their targets. The Fighter's job was to achieve air superiority and gain control of the skies.
