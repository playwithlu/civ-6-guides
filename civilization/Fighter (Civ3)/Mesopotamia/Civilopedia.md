# Fighter (Civ3)/Mesopotamia/Civilopedia

The barbarian Fighter is the barbarians' ground combat unit. Skill-wise, it is roughly on par with the
warrior. Since the emphasis is on building wondrous monuments in this scenario,
the various barbarian units have been given no build cost to prevent the player from accruing large
amounts of victory points by concentrating on killing barbarians.
