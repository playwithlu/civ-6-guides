# Explorer (Civ4)

The Explorer is an exploration unit, which becomes available with [Compass%20%28Civ4%29](Compass). They upgrade from [Scout%20%28Civ4%29](Scouts), ignore [Terrain%20%28Civ4%29](terrain) movement costs and start with [Guerrilla%20%28Civ4%29](Guerrilla I), [Woodsman%20%28Civ4%29](Woodsman I), unless upgraded, and cannot be upgraded any further.
Like Scouts, Explorers will defend against enemy attacks but cannot attack on their own.
Strategy.
The Explorer can be turned into a "super medic" by attaching a [Great%20General%20%28Civ4%29](Great General) to it and giving it the [Medic%20%28Civ4%29](Medic III) [Promotion%20%28Civ4%29](promotion), allowing him to rapidly heal units on his and adjacent squares.
