# Mogadishu (Civ6)

Mogadishu is a trade [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-state) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It replaced [Lisbon%20%28Civ6%29](Lisbon) under all rulesets in the [Portugal%20Pack%20%28Civ6%29](Portugal Pack).
Strategy.
Mogadishu's [Suzerain%20%28Civ6%29](Suzerain) bonus helps protect maritime {{TradeRoute6}}s from [Barbarian%20%28Civ6%29](Barbarians). Mogadishu is useful on water-heavy [Map%20%28Civ6%29](maps), particularly for [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) like the [Phoenician%20%28Civ6%29](Phoenicians) and the [English%20%28Civ6%29](English) (who have good incentives to build and develop [Harbor%20%28Civ6%29](Harbors)) or trade-oriented civilizations like the [Dutch%20%28Civ6%29](Dutch), whose {{TradeRoute6}}s are frequently at risk of being plundered by seafaring Barbarians. The [Portuguese%20%28Civ6%29](Portuguese), who can only send {{TradeRoute6}}s to [Coastal%20%28Civ6%29](coastal) destinations, will also want to take Suzerainty of Mogadishu.
On the other hand, there will almost always be a better city-state to which players can send their {{Envoy6}}s on land-heavy maps, where Mogadishu's bonus doesn't come into play nearly as often. Also, those in [Age%20%28Civ6%29%23Golden%20Age](Golden Ages) between the [Renaissance%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Renaissance) and [Modern%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Modern Eras) may want to ignore this city-state, since the [Age%20%28Civ6%29%23Dedications](Reform the Coinage Dedication) provides this bonus on both land and sea.
