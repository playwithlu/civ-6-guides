# Zero (Civ5)

Game Info.
[Unique%20unit%20%28Civ5%29](Unique) air unit of the [Japanese%20%28Civ5%29](Japanese) [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilization). Replaces the [Fighter%20%28Civ5%29](Fighter).
Strategy.
The Zero is essentially a super-fighter. Although it isn't stronger in general terms, it lacks armor and, being lightweight, doesn't require the [Resources%20%28Civ5%29](resource)! Also for that reason it is more maneuverable than any aircraft in the skies whatsoever, which conveys it a bonus versus the most dangerous adversary against other aircraft: the [Fighter%20%28Civ5%29](Fighter). It affords the Japanese an undisputed mastery over the skies in the [Atomic%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Atomic) and early [Information%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Information Eras). Use it to clear out enemy anti-air resistance, then sweep in with [Bomber%20%28Civ5%29](Bombers) to obliterate the enemy ground forces!
