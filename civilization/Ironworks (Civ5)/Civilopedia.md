# Ironworks (Civ5)/Civilopedia

An ironworks is a facility where iron ore is purified and fashioned into iron or steel. The process begins with exposing the raw material to extremely high heat, and after possibly mixing in other materials, results in some form of purified iron or steel. Iron smelting dates back at least to 1200 BC, and perhaps earlier. Not surprisingly, ironworks are dangerous places, and they require tough, highly-skilled and courageous workers.
