# Tsoodzil (Civ5)/Civilopedia

To the Navajo, Tsoodzil, the "turquoise mountain," was one of the four sacred peaks marking the cardinal directions (in this case, south) and boundaries of their homeland in New Mexico. A 4100-foot dormant stratovolcano now named after President Zachary Taylor, for the Navaho Tsoodzil was home to the Black God, Turquoise Boy and Turquoise Girl.
