# Spearman (Civ5)

Game Info.
Front-line unit of the [Ancient%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Ancient Era).
Strategy.
The Spearman is the first melee unit available after the [Warrior%20%28Civ5%29](Warrior). Armed with a spear and a shield, it is slightly more powerful and expensive than the Warrior. However, its long weapon also gives it a significant combat bonus against , namely the [Horseman%20%28Civ5%29](Horsemen). Where practical, however (e.g., on the defensive by a [City%20%28Civ5%29](city), in rough [Terrain%20%28Civ5%29](terrain)), it is usually more economical to produce the more mobile [Archer%20%28Civ5%29](Archer) or [Composite%20Bowman%20%28Civ5%29](Composite Bowman), or wait for [Pikeman%20%28Civ5%29](Pikemen) when research is fast.
Use it as you would other front-line units, but focus on positions with [Zone%20of%20control%20%28Civ5%29](zone of control) that block flat land, and thus protect the weaker elements of your army (archers, siege machines) that are likely to attract mounted attacks. (Note that a city, as mentioned above, will also confer a ZOC.)
