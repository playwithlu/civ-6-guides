 Leadership is an in "[Civilization%20II](Civilization II)".
Civilopedia entry.
Through the Middle Ages, military forces were only assembled as needed, and continued to serve until the current conflict had ended. Though certain leaders had proven to be adept and occasionally brilliant in their methods, the short periods for which they served made their fame short-lived. As regular armies became more prevalent, military leaders had the opportunity to distinguish themselves through the formulation of brilliant military tactics. The tactics of leaders such as these would be studied by successive generations, and modified to fit new situations up to and including the present day.
