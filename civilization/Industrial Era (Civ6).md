# Industrial Era (Civ6)

The Industrial Era is the fifth [Era%20%28Civ6%29](era) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is preceded by the [Renaissance%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Renaissance Era) and followed by the [Modern%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Modern Era).
Intro.
 The steady hum of machinery, the acrid smell of smoke, vision clouded by ash and soot - these are the signs of changing times. The lure of scientific and cultural advancement is the engine driving your realm forward. Now your challenge is to maintain the delicate balance between earth and man, between peace and war.
Game Info.
The Industrial Era brings progress for your civilization on many levels: more gunpowder-based weapons (although that doesn't make real difference as of yet), the first area-of-effect buildings, new economy-related districts which finally allow your cities to grow further, powerful culture-oriented buildings and policies...and the brand new , ready to charge up your cities and turbo-boost their performance! Start building those [Coal%20Power%20Plant%20%28Civ6%29](Coal Power Plants) or your rivals may outpace you!
Now is the moment to start managing your growing empire and direct it towards a certain type of victory (if you haven't already). The new boosters will allow your cities to supercharge their building and training activities - use this to enlarge your army (if you need), to build up your infrastructure and work on wonders.
The ability to form Corps and Fleets will allow militarily weaker civilizations to even the odds, and with the [Military%20Academy%20%28Civ6%29](Military Academy), they can train these new formations directly. Or, you can use them to finally outmatch your neighbors' armies and take their cities! A good military push at this point will benefit every civilization, conquering new lands and resources, and preparing it for the race towards victory.
