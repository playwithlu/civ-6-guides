# Speed (Civ4)

Speed is a game setting in "[Civilization%20IV](Civilization IV)" that modifies the general costs and "scales" of all actions in the game, including the number of [turn](turn)s. It is represented as "Game Speed" on the Game Setup menu.
Generally speaking, Quick games have all their turn costs and research times 66% of their normal value (everything is a third faster), Normal games have 100% of their normal value, Epic games have everything at 150% their normal value (takes one and a half as long), and Marathon games are 300% their normal value (it takes 3 times as long). There are some minor exceptions. In practice, slower game modes mean: [City%20%28Civ4%29](cities) grow much more slowly, build times are much slower, and [Worker%20%28Civ4%29](Workers) will take much longer to build [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ4%29](tile improvements), but [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ4](units) retain their normal [Movement%20%28Civ4%29](movement speed).
Total Game Turns.
In [vanilla](vanilla) "Civilization IV" and ', there are fewer turns because the game cannot support a turn interval of less than a year. This was fixed in '.
Turns and year.
The year progresses in 6 to 8 iterations. When starting in the [Ancient%20Era%20%28Civ4%29](Ancient Era) the game starts in [4000%20BC](4000 BC) and ends in [2050%20AD](2050 AD). Below is a table showing the iterations of year progression at different game speeds.
Wood Chops and Whips.
All [Chopping%20%28Civ4%29](chops) and [Whipping%20%28Civ4%29](whips) are multiplied in line with the factors above. A woodchop will provide 3x as much wood on Marathon as it does normally.
