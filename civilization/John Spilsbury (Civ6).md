Unique ability.
Grants 1 , a uniquely manufactured Luxury resource which provides +4 .
Strategy.
Similar to other Great Merchants that grant unique luxuries, John Spilsbury's ability can give [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) a needed boost to their yields in the late game. However, a bonus luxury resource, while nice, is not usually worth spending or on recruiting. The exceptions are when playing as [Scottish%20%28Civ6%29](Scotland), which can turn into and ; and as [Montezuma%20%28Civ6%29](Montezuma), who can turn luxuries into Combat Strength. Spilsbury is a gamechanger for both Scotland and Montezuma, and should be a high priority for both of them.
