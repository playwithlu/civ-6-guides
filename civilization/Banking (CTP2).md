Great Library entry.
The first banks developed in response to the great risk of early trading. Bandits, uncertain foreign markets, and a multitude of foreign currencies made caravans and trade ships very vulnerable. Without a way to mitigate the risk of piracy, a merchant could lose his or her livelihood with the destruction of his or her caravan. Banking helped to change this by splitting risk between bank and merchant. The Romans developed banking into a robust system of mortgages, loans, and credits. With banking, capital was available to expand trade and spread commerce widely.
