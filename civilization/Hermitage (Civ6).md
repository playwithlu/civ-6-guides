# Hermitage (Civ6)

The Hermitage is an in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It must be built along a [River%20%28Civ6%29](River) on a non-[Desert%20%28Civ6%29](Desert) and non-[Tundra%20%28Civ6%29](Tundra) [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tile).
Strategy.
In the [vanilla](vanilla) version of the game, it is almost never worth building the Hermitage, as it's way too expensive and does next to nothing. If you have 1450 to spend and any available tracts of land to settle, you can found two more [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities), build [Theater%20Square%20%28Civ6%29](Theater Squares) with [Amphitheater%20%28Civ6%29](Amphitheaters) and [Art%20Museum%20%28Civ6%29](Art Museums) there, and still have some left over (possibly even purchasing [Settler%20%28Civ6%29](Settlers) and [Building%20%28Civ6%29](buildings) with if you're rich). These s and buildings will provide your empire with more , , and points and slots for [Great%20Work%20%28Civ6%29](Great Works) than this wonder will, and the Museums can even be [Theming%20bonus%20%28Civ6%29](themed). Not so much a "wonder" as a waste of time and , the Hermitage can safely be ignored even if you're pursuing a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Cultural Victory).
From ' onward, nothing changes about the Hermitage, but you can maximize your earnings from its Great Works slots by giving a [Governor%20%28Civ6%29](Governor) the [Curator%20%28Civ6%29](Curator) title ([Reyna%20%28Financier%29%20%28Civ6%29](Reyna) in "Rise and Fall", [Pingala%20%28Educator%29%20%28Civ6%29](Pingala) in ') and assigning them to the city that builds the Hermitage to turn it into a hub. Even so, 1450 is a hefty price to pay for a wonder that doesn't have any "wonder-like" effects. The only [Leaders%20%28Civ6%29](leader) that should seriously consider building it is [Kristina%20%28Civ6%29](Kristina), since she can effectively double its and output by theming it; other leaders will almost always have better ways to spend their , even when playing a cultural game.
