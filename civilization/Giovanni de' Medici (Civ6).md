# Giovanni de' Medici (Civ6)

Giovanni de' Medici is a [Great%20Merchant%20%28Civ6%29](Great Merchant) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Unique ability.
Instantly builds a and in this district. The Bank gets 2 slots, which can hold anything.
Strategy.
Giovanni de' Medici is a singularly powerful Great Merchant for a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Cultural Victory), especially if your strategy revolves around [Great%20Work%20%28Civ6%29%23Relics](Relics), which can be cumbersome to store a lot of. For this reason, [Kongolese%20%28Civ6%29](Kongo) and cultural [Polish%20%28Civ6%29](Poland) should be looking to pick up de' Medici. The additional Great Work slots can also help any cultural [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) squeeze some extra out of their city with a [Curator%20%28Civ6%29](Curator) [Pingala%20%28Educator%29%20%28Civ6%29](Pingala) in it. On the other hand, if you have a threatening -focused opponent, it may be worth recruiting de' Medici just to deny access to him. Some extra Great Work slots (and a free from the Market he builds) never hurt anyone.
