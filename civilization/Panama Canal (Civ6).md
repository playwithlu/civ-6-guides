# Panama Canal (Civ6)

The Panama Canal is an [Industrial%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Industrial Era) [Wonder%20%28Civ6%29](Wonder) in "". It must be built on a flat land [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tile) that meet the following criteria:
Strategy.
The Panama Canal serves much the same purpose as the regular Canal, save that it can span multiple tiles instead of one. Think of it as a special replacement for Canals: the only thing this wonder provides that its district counterpart doesn't is +10 , so if you want to build the Panama Canal, think about whether or not you can build a regular Canal anywhere else that satisfies your needs. If so, you can use one [Military%20Engineer%20%28Civ6%29](Military Engineer) to pay 40% of the Canal's cost (80% if you are playing as [English%20%28Civ6%29](England)), which you cannot do with the Panama Canal.
To use the Panama Canal effectively, you need to know how to use the Canal effectively, so please check [Canal%20%28Civ6%29%23Strategy](here) for additional information. Since this wonder is even more situational than an already very situational district, it should be very low on your priority list, especially in the early Industrial Era when you have a lot of new, more crucial pieces of infrastructure unlocked.
Only the main tile of the Panama Canal counts as a wonder; thus only this tile gives a major [Adjacency%20bonus%20%28Civ6%29](adjacency bonus) to [Theater%20Square%20%28Civ6%29](Theater Squares). The supporting tile(s) behave like regular Canal(s) and will give a major adjacency bonus to [Industrial%20Zone%20%28Civ6%29](Industrial Zones). (Additionally, they won't remove terrain features like [Woods%20%28Civ6%29](Woods), [Rainforest%20%28Civ6%29](Rainforests), and [Marsh%20%28Civ6%29](Marshes).)
