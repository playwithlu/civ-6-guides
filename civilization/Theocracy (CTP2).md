Theocracies were nations whose religious and state laws were based on the same doctrines. The separation of the state from the church did not exist. One of the earliest theocracies rose amidst the chaos after the fall of the Roman Empire, as social institutions, such as education, fell under the aegis of the Roman Catholic church. Monasteries became the bureaucratic backbone of Europe, handing such things as mail, trade and taxation. The various "barbarian" states that contributed to the fall of Rome turned to the church for guidance in establishing governments. Many of them established monarchies loyal to the central theocracy, expanding the power of the church even further. In the modern era, some Muslim nations established theocracies, ruled by supreme religious figures, and where Islamic law governed every aspect of life.
