# Victory (Civ4)

There are six ways to achieve victory in "[Civilization%20IV](Civilization IV)".
Conquest.
Eliminate all other [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ4](civilizations).
Cultural.
Be in possession of 3 [City%20%28Civ4%29](cities) with legendary [Culture%20%28Civ4%29](culture).
Domination.
Lead in world [Population%20%28Civ4%29](population) by 30% and have 65% of the world under your control (the percentages may vary).
Space Race.
Build and Launch your spacecraft and get to [Alpha%20Centauri%20%28star%20system%29](Alpha Centauri) first.
Diplomatic.
Win a [United%20Nations%20%28Civ4%29](United Nations) [Elections%20%28Civ4%29](election) as world leader for diplomatic victory.
First, you must reach the [Modern%20Era%20%28Civ4%29](Modern Era) and build the United Nations [List%20of%20wonders%20in%20Civ4](wonder). Once it has been built, an election will be held and one [Leaders%20%28Civ4%29](leader) will be chosen to be the Secretary General. This leader can then choose from a number of different voting agendas, including the election for a world leader. If the Secretary General holds a world leader election and a single leader receives at least 60% of the votes, he or she becomes the world leader and wins a Diplomatic Victory.
In "", it is also possible to win a Diplomatic Victory by building the [Apostolic%20Palace%20%28Civ4%29](Apostolic Palace) wonder, which allows a world leader to be chosen in much the same way as the United Nations.
Time.
Have the highest score when the time ends. (At Normal [Speed%20%28Civ4%29](speed), it ends in [2050%20AD](2050 AD).)
