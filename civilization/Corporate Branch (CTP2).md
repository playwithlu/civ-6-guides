Great Library entry.
Multinational corporations often kept their main executive offices within their home country, opting to send their manufacturing and production operations to countries with cheaper labor pools. They could hire workers for a fraction of the cost of domestic workers, getting better return on their investment in factories and manufacturing plants. Corporate branches also established themselves as commercial entities in foreign markets, selling their products abroad. Though the globalization of the economy in the 20th century encouraged corporations to expand their borders, some countries suffered at the hands of first-world multinationals.
