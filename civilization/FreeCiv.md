Versions.
The project originally started as an emulation of "[Sid%20Meier%27s%20Civilization](Sid Meier's Civilization)" for UNIX-based platforms, but has since evolved into one of the longest running open-source game communities in history. It was originally released in January [1996](1996), prior to "Civilization II". A modernized version 2.6 was released in July 2018. A public beta of the greatly expanded 3.0 has since been released, and is the version currently running on the web.
Modes/Rules.
The user community has created historic "Civ1" and "Civ2" compatibility modes which closely emulate [Sid%20Meier](Sid Meier)'s commercial games.

This includes "Civ2Civ3" hybrid rules and the newest "Multiplayer II Evolution" released in .
Beginners can select the "Start Scenario Game" option, which includes a tutorial scenario - an ordinary game but with lots of on-screen advice.
