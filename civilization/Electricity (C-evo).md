# Electricity (C-evo)

[Electricity](Electricity) in the free game [C-evo](C-evo) leads to the intrinsically useful advances [Radio%20%28C-evo%29](Radio) and [Refrigeration%20%28C-evo%29](Refrigeration) and lets you build a very good value [city%20improvement%20%28C-evo%29](city improvement), a [Power%20Station%20%28C-evo%29](Power Station), in any suitable city that has a factory. 
However, if you have the right selection of cooperative friends and are confident of building the [Hoover%20Dam%20%28C-evo%29](Hoover Dam), Electricity will be of no use to you. The Hoover Dam (which can be built in any city that adjoins a [river%20%28C-evo%29](river) or a [mountain%20%28C-evo%29](mountain)) gives each of your cities, in effect, a [Hydroelectric%20Dam%20%28C-evo%29](Hydroelectric Dam), which is a free equivalent of the Power Station with much less [pollution%20%28C-evo%29](pollution).
