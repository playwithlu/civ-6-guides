Strategy.
The Camel Archer is a [Medieval%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Medieval Era) version of the earlier mounted archer units, but has considerable advantages over them. First, it may move after attacking, and second, it doesn't suffer theÂ [Chariot%20Archer%20%28Civ5%29](Chariot Archer's) rough [Terrain%20%28Civ5%29](terrain) penalty. And of course, its attack is much stronger, making it extremely dangerous in the field. This unit is stronger than the [Mongolian%20%28Civ5%29](Mongolian) [Keshik%20%28Civ5%29](Keshik), but it doesn't have any other special abilities.
Use it primarily for hit-and-run attacks. Its ability to fire and then move away out of danger is invaluable when attacking [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities).
