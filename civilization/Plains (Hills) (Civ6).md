# Plains (Hills) (Civ6)

Plains (Hills) are a base terrain in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)", which is a variant of [Plains%20%28Civ6%29](Plains) tiles. Like other Plains tiles, they are usually found relatively close to the equator of the [Map%20%28Civ6%29](map).
Plains Hills provide 1 in addition to the 1 and 1 yielded by basic Plains tiles. Plains Hills may be improved with s, which makes them significantly more productive than other Plains tiles. All [Hills%20%28Civ6%29](Hills) have a +3 Combat Strength modifier, which can strengthen city defenses, as well as protect vulnerable units.
Strategy.
Plains Hills (especially those on [River%20%28Civ6%29](Rivers)) are excellent locations to place [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) early in the game. This is because cities automatically increase the yields on their tiles to 2 and 1 if either yield is lacking. This puts Plains Hills in the unique position of providing 2 and 2 when cities are placed on them. This improves a city's productivity early on, especially before [Technologies%20%28Civ6%29](technologies) such as [Apprenticeship%20%28Civ6%29](Apprenticeship) and [Industrialization%20%28Civ6%29](Industrialization) greatly improve the yields of [Mine%20%28Civ6%29](Mines). After this point, placing cities on Plains Hills makes less of a difference, and could even be discouraged as the yields of placing a Mine on one of these tiles outshines that of the city itself.
