# Ground Crews (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Aeroplanes are complex and fragile machines, especially when they are getting shot at. From the beginning, as early as the American Civil War, military balloons had a dedicated ground crew, those who could fix the craft and keep it flying (well, floating). In World War I, every airbase had its contingent of ground crewmen working to repair, maintain, arm, and service the airplanes. Of course, the fact that they and their facilities were indispensable to the operation made them prime targets for the enemy, so strafing and bombing airfields was conducted on a regular basis. As warplanes became ever more sophisticated, so too did the ground crews ... to the point that specialized training now takes months.
