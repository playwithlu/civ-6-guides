Tips.
Although these achievements aren't hard to earn, they can be time consuming. To get used to the game (and getting a few achievements along the way) it's best use the easiest [Difficulty%20level%20%28CivRev%29](difficulty), Chieftain. The quickest method of winning on this difficulty is a "Domination" victory, as even single squads are capable of taking [Capital%20%28CivRev%29](capitals) due to the 100% combat bonus. Saving prior to every attack and reloading if the attack fails, trying something different (such as moving one [Tile%20%28CivRev%29](tile)), then attacking again will reset the combat odds (meaning you might win a close match-up). This tactic is useful on all difficulties (especially the harder ones) and takes very little time if the game is installed on the Xbox 360.
