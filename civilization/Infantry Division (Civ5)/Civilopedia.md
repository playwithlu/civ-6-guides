# Infantry Division (Civ5)/Civilopedia

An infantry division was generally made up of two to four brigades, each brigade between 1200 and 2500 soldiers. Commanded by a general, the division was the basic unit of maneuver during battle; in theory, these generals were tasked with husbanding the striking power of their division until able to deliver one hard blow rather than a series of lesser ones.
