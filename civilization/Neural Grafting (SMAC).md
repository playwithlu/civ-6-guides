# Neural Grafting (SMAC)

The insatiable drive for efficiency spawned by [Industrial%20Automation%20%28SMAC%29](Industrial Automation) drives the development of Neural Grafting. This new technology, based on [Secrets%20of%20the%20Human%20Brain%20%28SMAC%29](Secrets of the Human Brain), allows attachment of digital circuitry directly to the neural cortex. With these implants, individuals willing to undergo Neural Grafting can enhance many aspects of their physical being, from heightened senses to faster reaction times.
