Summary.
The Fire Trireme dominates the ancient inland seas with its fiery weapon. In fact, until the discovery of the [Ship%20of%20the%20Line%20%28CTP1%29](Ship of the Line), the Fire Trireme offers the best value for naval domination, as long as the navy can stay within shallow coastal waters. The Fire Trireme's only weakness is its small cargo hold. It can only carry one unit.

Greek fire was developed by a Greek-speaking Syrian refugee in 650 AD. Comprised of naphtha, sulfur, saltpeter, quicklime, and petroleum, Greek fire burned on contact with water. Perhaps its most spectacular moment came when the Byzantine emperor Alexius I Comnenus burned down a Pisan fleet in the eleventh century. The Emperor had ordered each of his ships set with a lion's head made of iron or bronze. Tubes fed through the lions' mouths into containers of Greek fire so that when battle commenced, the lions appeared to be "vomiting fire."
