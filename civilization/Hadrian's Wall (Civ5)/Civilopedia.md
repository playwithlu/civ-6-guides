# Hadrian's Wall (Civ5)/Civilopedia

Hadrian's Wall, named for the Roman Emperor Hadrian who mandated its construction beginning in 122 AD, was a massive defensive fortification dividing the northern frontier of England. Roughly 73 miles long (117km), the wall extends from Bowness-on-Solway along the western coast, to Wallsend (once the location of the Roman fort Segedunum) on the eastern coast. Primarily built from limestone, over the course of several years following its construction, the defenses provided by the wall would be bolstered by more than a dozen full-size forts, housing up to 1,000 Roman soldiers each.
