# Entrepreneurship (Civ5)/Civilopedia

Entrepreneurship, from the French term "to undertake," refers to the capability and willingness by an individual to develop, organize and manage a commercial venture in the hopes of making a profit. In history, entrepreneurship has taken many forms, from the great explorer-merchants of Renaissance Italy to the government-chartered companies of the Age of Discovery to the robber barons of the Industrial Age; regardless of the form, the willingness to risk their own funds to generate greater wealth has driven the evolution of civilization as surely as any other factor.
