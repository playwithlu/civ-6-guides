# Sakdina (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Sakdina – the feudal system in Thai medieval life – placed each individual in a hierarchical system of mutual obligation. Those lower down could call upon favors from those higher up, who were obliged to grant them (within reason), meaning that all levels of society were bound and committed to each other.
