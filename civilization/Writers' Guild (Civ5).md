# Writers' Guild (Civ5)

Game Info.
Center for poetry and drama; provides the means for producing [Great%20People%20%28Civ5%29%23Types%20of%20Great%20People](Great Writers).
Strategy.
In "[Brave%20New%20World](Brave New World)", Great Writers are produced in a new way — not through the generic s placed in your cultural buildings ([Amphitheater%20%28Civ5%29](Amphitheater), [Opera%20House%20%28Civ5%29](Opera House), etc.), but solely through the Writers' Guild. Just like the [Artists%27%20Guild%20%28Civ5%29](Artists') and [Musicians%27%20Guild%20%28Civ5%29](Musicians' Guilds), it doesn't require all your [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities) to have a specific building — once you research [Drama%20and%20Poetry%20%28Civ5%29](Drama and Poetry), you can build a Writers' Guild. However, you should carefully decide which city to build it in, since it will be the "only" means of producing this particular type of Great Person.
The Writers' Guild is like a national wonder in that there can only be one in your empire, but it does not have other building prerequisites, and the cost does not increase based on the number of cities in the empire.
