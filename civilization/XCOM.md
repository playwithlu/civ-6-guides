# XCOM

The plot of the "XCOM" series revolves around an elite international organization that tries to prevent [aliens](aliens) from invading and conquering [Earth](Earth). Some games in the series have been a mixture of simulation and [turn](turn)-based tactics games (similar to [turn-based%20strategy](turn-based strategy) games, albeit on a smaller scale); others have been real-time tactics, third-person shooter, or space flight simulator games. The series is occasionally referenced in the "[Civilization%20%28series%29](Civilization)" games, though very little "XCOM"-related content has been added to them outside of [mods](mods) and [scenario](scenario)s.
