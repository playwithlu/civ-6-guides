# Religious Settlements (Civ6)

Religious Settlements is a [Pantheon%20%28Civ6%29](Pantheon) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It increases [Borders%20%28Civ6%29](border) expansion rate by 15% in the player's [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities). In "", it also provides a free [Settler%20%28Civ6%29](Settler) in the founder's .
Strategy.
The advantage of Religious Settlements is that everyone benefits from it: faster border expansion is helpful for all [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations), all [Leaders%20%28Civ6%29](leaders), and all [Victory%20%28Civ6%29](victory) conditions. The disadvantage of Religious Settlements is that "almost every other pantheon is better for one or more specific victory conditions". It's a good pantheon for players to choose if they're not concerned about founding and spreading a [Religion%20%28Civ6%29](religion), or if they want to claim more [Territory%20%28Civ6%29](territory) without focusing on developing their empire's .
The main advantage of Religious Settlements is that unlike a -generating pantheon, it has absolutely no requirement whatsoever: any city that has the pantheon receives the bonus automatically. With the [Civilization%20VI%20June%202019%20Update](June 2019 Update), it also provides the founder with a free Settler, making it one of the most powerful and contested pantheons. In [Single%20player](single-player) games, this pantheon is most likely to be the first or second one to go, so only civilizations with early generation can actually get a hold of this.
