# Justinian's Leadership (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Emperor Justinian took the throne in 527, after the death of his uncle Justin I. Over the course of his 38-year reign,
he would oversee the glory years of the Byzantine empire. He oversaw the construction of the great 
Hagia Sophia, reformed the Byzantine legal system, and with the help of the great general 
Belisarius, was able to reconquer much of North Africa, Italy, and Spain from the barbarians who had sacked Rome. 
His wife, the extremely intelligent and ambitious Empress Theodora, served as a co-ruler with Justinian throughout his reign. 
She is credited with saving Justinian's crown during the Nika riot of 532, of being a dedicated patron of the poor and 
disadvantaged, and for being one of the most beautiful women in the empire. Together their leadership helped Byzantium regain
the military and cultural glory lost by the Roman world after the sacking of Rome.
