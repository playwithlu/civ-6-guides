# Kublai Khan (Civ6)

Kublai Khan (23 September 1215 â€“ 18 February 1294), also known as Emperor Shizu of Yuan, was the fifth of the Mongols, ruling from 1260 until his death. He also founded the in 1271 after his , ruling as its first emperor. He leads both the [Chinese%20%28Civ6%29](Chinese) and the [Mongolian%20%28Civ6%29](Mongolians) in '.
Kublai Khan, unlike [Genghis%20Khan%20%28Civ6%29](his grandfather), focuses on establishing {{TradeRoute6}}s and using the accompanying {{Eureka6}}s and {{Inspiration6}}s to fuel a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Science](Science Victory).
In-Game.
Kublai Khan's unique [Agenda%20%28Civ6%29](agenda) is Pax Mongolica. He likes [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) who have a strong military and high {{Gold6}} yield per turn, and hates those who have a weak military or low income.
His [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader ability) is Gerege. All of his [Government%20%28Civ6%29](governments) receive an additional {{EconomicPolicyIcon6}} Economic [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](policy slot), and he gains a random {{Eureka6}} and {{Inspiration6}} when he first establishes a {{TradingPost6}} in another major civilization's city.
Detailed Approach.
With an extra Economic Policy slot available, Kublai Khan is well-positioned for a number of different [Victory%20%28Civ6%29](victories). His {{TradeRoute6}}s need to keep running, though, so he should be careful about planning new wars. Kublai is always looking for new friends, as he receives {{Eureka6}}s and {{Inspiration6}}s from the first successful {{TradingPost6}} in a foreign Civilization, advances that might assist a Science or [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Culture Victory).
