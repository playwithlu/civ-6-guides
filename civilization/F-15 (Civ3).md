# F-15 (Civ3)

Like other [Jet%20Fighter%20%28Civ3%29](jet fighters), F-15s are faster versions of their predecessor and F-15s pack very potent attack power.
They may execute all air missions and have radar that allows them to "see" two squares, regardless of blocking terrain. They may be based in any city or aircraft carrier on the map.
An [American%20%28Civ3%29](American) city needs oil and aluminum in its Strategic Resource box to build an F-15.
