Great Library entry.
Safe and easy access to natural resources meant the difference between life and death in early stages of civilization. Towns could only develop near food, water, and shelter. Roads paved the way for distant cities to take advantage of these same resources. As roads improved, travel increased. The easy exchange of travelers allowed cities to consolidate resources, wealth, and knowledge, encouraging bonds between some cities and war between others.
