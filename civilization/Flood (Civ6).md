# Flood (Civ6)

A flood is a natural [Disasters%20%28Civ6%29](disaster) in "". There are two types of floods, described below.
River floods.
These are normal disasters which happen along [River%20%28Civ6%29](Rivers) with [Floodplains%20%28Civ6%29](Floodplains), which includes Rivers on all [Terrain%20%28Civ6%29](terrain) types except [Tundra%20%28Civ6%29](Tundra). The level of the water rises, flooding all Floodplains [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles) found along the River, and then recedes on the next turn.
River floods have three levels of severity, starting with Moderate and ending with 1000 Year Flood. The Disaster Intensity setting of the game controls what levels of flooding will occur more often, but [Climate%20%28Civ6%29](climate change) can also contribute to their severity.
The [Egyptian%20%28Civ6%29](Egyptians') [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](civilization ability) allows them to receive full fertility from Floods yet suffer no damage from them.
Floods can be summoned by a [Soothsayer%20%28Civ6%29](Soothsayer) standing on a Floodplains tile in the [Apocalypse%20%28Civ6%29](Apocalypse) [Game%20mode%20%28Civ6%29](game mode). 
Flood effects.
The table below lists the percentage chance of all effects happening at each different severity level.
It is interesting to note that floods fertilize each type of Floodplains differently; the exact percentages are listed in the table below. Each expresses the chance of a tile to gain +1 of the given yield, and note that a single tile may gain "both" yields from the same flood!
Since the [Civilization%20VI%20April%202019%20Update](Antarctic Late Summer Update) Floods will lose their fertilization effects after [Climate%20%28Civ6%29%23Phases%20of%20Climate%20Change](Climate Change Phase IV). They won't start removing yields gained, though.
Coastal floods.
The second type of floods happen on [Coastal%20%28Civ6%29](coastal) lowland tiles, and are a direct result of melting [Ice%20%28Civ6%29](ice caps) (which in turn is a result of [Climate%20%28Civ6%29%23Mechanics%20of%20Climate%20and%20Climate%20Change](climate change)). Coastal flooding will start occurring as climate change progresses to certain phases, and will first affect the 1-meter tiles (that is, the lowest-lying flatlands), then the 2-meter tiles, and finally the 3-meter ones.
As climate change progresses further, coastal lowland will become Submerged. Submerged tiles are irrecoverable and become permanent [Coast%20%28Civ6%29](Coast) tiles; all districts there are lost. The tiles, however, may be worked as normal Coast tiles; they may also receive any applicable [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](improvements) (such as an [Offshore%20Wind%20Farm%20%28Civ6%29](Offshore Wind Farm)).
