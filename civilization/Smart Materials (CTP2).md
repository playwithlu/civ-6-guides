Great Library entry.
Materials that were able to dynamically respond to stimuli, or "smart" materials, first appeared in the 19th century in the form of a piezo-electric crystal that generated electrical fields when exposed to heat or to stress. In the 22nd century, smart materials development exploded as the need for highly evolved plastics and ceramics rose. Many were controlled by microprocessors and advanced feedback systems. They could act as muscles, contracting against unusual stresses, or materials that surpassed the strength of any conventional material. Virtually any kind of function could be embedded in smart materials, from movement and energy response to light filtration. These materials were indispensable in the efforts to colonized and explore the oceans.
