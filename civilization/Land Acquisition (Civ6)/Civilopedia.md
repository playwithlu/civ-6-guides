# Land Acquisition (Civ6)/Civilopedia

The state needs land, and the state will acquire land. Methods for gaining land for state are ancient, and most modern states have the equivalent of the legal concept of “eminent domain,” whereby privately-held land may be compelled from individuals for use by the state, in exchange for the fair market value of that land.
