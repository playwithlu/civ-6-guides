Strategy.
The more advanced version of the Triplane, the Fighter has greater combat strength (thanks to improved weaponry) and greater operational range (thanks to improved hull design) than its predecessor. To make a long story short, you should use it as you would a Triplane - it's just more effective at what it does than the older unit. It can defend against enemy [Air%20unit%20%28Civ5%29](aircraft) with Interception mode, Air Sweep enemy targets to eliminate defending anti-aircraft weapons, and keep an eye on the enemy's [Borders%20%28Civ5%29](border regions), as well.
