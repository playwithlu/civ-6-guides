# Uranium (Civ6)

 Uranium is an [Atomic%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Atomic Era) [Resource%20%28Civ6%29%23Strategic](Strategic Resource) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is revealed with [Combined%20Arms%20%28Civ6%29](Combined Arms).
 Uranium can appear on any type of land [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tile) except [Floodplains%20%28Civ6%29](Floodplains), [Oasis%20%28Civ6%29](Oases), and [Marshes%20%28Civ6%29](Marshes). 
Strategy.
 Uranium is the last Strategic Resource in the game. It has three uses: enabling some of the most powerful [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](units) in the game (the [Modern%20Armor%20%28Civ6%29](Modern Armor) and the [Nuclear%20Submarine%20%28Civ6%29](Nuclear Submarine) in [vanilla](vanilla) "Civilization VI" and ', and the [Giant%20Death%20Robot%20%28Civ6%29](Giant Death Robot) in '), allowing the construction of [Nuclear%20weapons%20%28Civ6%29](nukes) (great for the warmonger), and being used as fuel for the [Nuclear%20Power%20Plant%20%28Civ6%29](Nuclear Power Plant). It is the most powerful Strategic Resource, but also the rarest.
Interestingly, like its cousin , Uranium has a considerable bias towards spawning on [Tundra%20%28Civ6%29](Tundra) and [Snow%20%28Civ6%29](Snow) tiles. This can be a handy source of for [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) attempting to build the [Amundsen-Scott%20Research%20Station%20%28Civ6%29](Amundsen-Scott Research Station), or a fiery castigation for the enemies of [Russian%20%28Civ6%29](Russia) or [Canadian%20%28Civ6%29](Canada).
