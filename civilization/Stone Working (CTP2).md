The craft of building with stone or clay originated when prehistoric man sought to build more permanent shelters that mimicked the natural caves they used. These early structures were often constructed without the use of cementing agents or binders, and involved rough or crudely cut stone or bricks. Stones of various sizes could be erected in rows to provide walls for city defenses as well. Different stone working techniques developed independent of each other in Sumer and Egypt in 4000 BC. Ancient Sumerians made up for their lack of access to large stone deposits by building massive ziggurats out of fired clay bricks. Egyptians hauled huge blocks of limestone over considerable distances to build the Pyramids.
