# Chu-Ko-Nu (Civ5)

Game Info.
[Unique%20unit%20%28Civ5%29](Unique) ranged unit of the [Chinese%20%28Civ5%29](Chinese) [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilization). Replaces the [Crossbowman%20%28Civ5%29](Crossbowman).
Strategy.
The Chu-Ko-Nu is one of the strongest ranged attackers of the [Medieval%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Medieval Era), thanks to its ability to fire twice in a turn even before it reaches a high enough level to gain access to the respective [Promotions%20%28Civ5%29](promotion). Although its ranged strength appears to be lower than that of a Crossbowman, firing twice more than makes up the difference. Entrench it in a [City%20%28Civ5%29](city), or a [Fort%20%28Civ5%29](Fort), and lay waste to the enemy armies!
The ability to fire twice carries over when the Chu-Ko-Nu is upgraded, creating really dangerous [Gatling%20Gun%20%28Civ5%29](Gatling Guns), [Machine%20Gun%20%28Civ5%29](Machine Guns), and [Bazooka%20%28Civ5%29](Bazookas).
