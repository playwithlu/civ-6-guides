# Christianity (Civ3)/Civilopedia

There are a great many variants of Christianity, the youngest of the monotheistic religions apart from Islam, and the most 
widely believed religion in the world. However, the vast majority of Christian sects and churches agree on the following: that there is one all-powerful and perfect God; 
that he had a son named Jesus Christ; that Christ was fully human and fully divine; that Christ was crucified and then 
resurrected; and that Christ's resurrection redeemed all human sin.
