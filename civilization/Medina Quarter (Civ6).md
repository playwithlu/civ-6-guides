Medina Quarter is an Economic [Policy%20Cards%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
This replaces the earlier [Insulae%20%28Civ6%29](Insulae), and has practically the same effect. However, you'll need an additional in each [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) in order to use it. This shouldn't be a problem for older cities, as each of them should have at least 3 districts already. 
The logic of using Medina Quarter is the same: it is a great way to speed up Population growth in big cities which have already exhausted other options, but have no access to [Neighborhood%20%28Civ6%29](Neighborhoods). However, you should juggle it with other "permanent use" Economic Policies, such as [Triangular%20Trade%20%28Civ6%29](Triangular Trade).
