# Warrior (Civ4)

The Warrior is replaced by the following [Unique%20unit%20%28Civ4%29](unique unit):
Strategy.
It serves as one of the starting units in each game, along with a [Settler%20%28Civ4%29](Settler) or a [Scout%20%28Civ4%29](Scout).
Build this melee combat unit for quick, early defense for your [City%20%28Civ4%29](cities) or as escorts for your defenseless Settlers. This unit is cheap to produce but weak, so you will want to make better units as soon as you are able. The Warrior can be an early scout that can protect themselves from [Barbarian%20%28Civ4%29](Barbarians), [Animal%20%28Civ4%29](animals), or any enemy unit.
