Strategy.
The Panzer is the German unique unit, and is both stronger and faster than the Tank it replaces. It also can move after combat, allowing it to blow huge holes in enemy lines and then barrel through before the enemy can repair the gap.
Thanks to the Panzer, the Germans gain an important advantage in late-game battles. Look to enhance this by developing [Cavalry%20%28Civ5%29](Cavalry) earlier, then upgrading it all the way to Panzers. This way you'll gain not only the natural advantages of the unit, but also all previously acquired [Promotions%20%28Civ5%29](promotions), thus creating a terrifyingly effective battlefield monster! Use concentrated Panzer attacks to crush the enemy lines, then heal the wounded units while moving the rest of your army into position and chasing down any remaining long-range enemy land units, like [Artillery%20%28Civ5%29](Artillery).
