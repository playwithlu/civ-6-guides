Great Library entry.
Hagia Sophia, or Aya Sofia, was one of the world's greatest religious monuments and considered by many to be the supreme example of Byzantine architecture. In AD 360, 30 or so years after Byzantium became the capital of the Roman Empire, Constantius II erected a basilican church. This church, which burned in 404, was rebuilt by Theodosius II in 415, and was again destroyed by fire in 532. The Holy Roman Emperor Justinian rebuilt the church from 532-537, rechristening it the Hagia Sophia, or "Church of Holy Wisdom." Designed by his architects Anthemius of Tralles and Isidorus of Miletus, the new structure was fireproof, but, in 558, severe earthquakes caused the magnificent domed ceiling to collapse. It was rebuilt in 563 and remained as a Christian monument and holy place for centuries.
The Turks converted Hagia Sophia into a mosque when the conquered Constantinople in 1453. In later years, they gradually removed or obliterated the Christian symbols, plastering and painting over interior figure mosaics, replacing the altar and pulpit with customary Muslim accoutrements and supplanting the cross on the top of the dome with a crescent. The four minarets that rise at the corners of the building were added one by one over the years. In 1935, Hagia Sophia was opened as a museum and dedicated as a non-denominational monument to all faiths.
