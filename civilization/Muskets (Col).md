# Muskets (Col)

Muskets are the weapons your colonists are using in a "[Sid%20Meier%27s%20Colonization](Sid Meier's Colonization)" game.
A colonist armed with 50 muskets becomes a [Soldiers%20%28Col%29](soldier).
You can produce muskets in any colony that has an [Armory%20%28Col%29](Armory) or any upgrade ([Magazine%20%28Col%29](Magazine) and [Arsenal%20%28Col%29](Arsenal)) of that building.
To produce muskets you need [Tools%20%28Col%29](Tools) that are converted into muskets. A [Master%20Gunsmiths%20%28Col%29](Master Gunsmith) increases the rate of production.
