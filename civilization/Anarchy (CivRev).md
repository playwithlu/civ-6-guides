# Anarchy (CivRev)

Anarchy is a temporary form of [Government%20%28CivRev%29](government) in "[Civilization%20Revolution](Civilization Revolution)" that halts all forms of production (including [Gold%20%28CivRev%29](gold), [Science%20%28CivRev%29](science), [Food%20%28CivRev%29](food) and construction of [List%20of%20units%20in%20CivRev](units) and [List%20of%20buildings%20in%20CivRev](buildings)) in a [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20CivRev](civilization's) [City%20%28CivRev%29](cities). Anarchy is also called "civil disorder." It only occurs when a civilization changes from one form of government to another and lasts only one turn.
Some civilizations, such as the [Chinese%20%28CivRev%29](Chinese), are granted an ability which makes them immune to the effects of anarchy. Anarchy is completely avoided if the player chooses to enact a form of government that has just been researched (which they are given the choice to do by the in-game [Advisor%20%28CivRev%29](advisors)).
