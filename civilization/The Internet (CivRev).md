# The Internet (CivRev)

The Internet is a [Wonder%20%28CivRev%29](wonder) in "[Civilization%20Revolution](Civilization Revolution)".
This wonder can be built when the player discovers the [Networking%20%28CivRev%29](Networking) [List%20of%20technologies%20in%20CivRev](technology) and its benefit is that it doubles the production of [Gold%20%28currency%29%20%28CivRev%29](gold) in all the player's [City%20%28CivRev%29](cities). This wonder's benefit is never cancelled.
Note that this wonder's benefit applies to the player's entire [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20CivRev](civilization) and not just the city in which it is built.
