# Consulate (Civ6)

The Consulate is a basic diplomatic [Building%20%28Civ6%29](building) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is built in the [Diplomatic%20Quarter%20%28Civ6%29](Diplomatic Quarter) [District%20%28Civ6%29](district).
Strategy.
The Consulate is quite a useful building, dedicated to earning s faster and counter-espionage. 2 s may sound small, but that bonus enhances the speed of earning s dramatically, especially for Tier 1 and Tier 2 [Government%20%28Civ6%29](governments). Later in the game, this building enhances your counter-espionage in this [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) and every city with an [Encampment%20%28Civ6%29](Encampment). Most [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) need to build Encampments only in their major cities (like their major centers when going for a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Science](Scientific Victory), or their hub to which their -boosting Governor is assigned when going for a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Cultural Victory)), which means [Vietnamese%20%28Civ6%29](Vietnam) - the only civilization that should build Encampments in every city - absolutely loves this building. Their incentives to surround the [Th%C3%A0nh%20%28Civ6%29](Th√†nh) in each city with s makes counterespionage very efficient for them, and this building just adds an additional layer on top of that.
The major challenge of the Consulate is deciding when to build it, since the Diplomatic Quarter is not usually high on the priority list and tends to get ignored for a while after being unlocked. This district should be constructed early if you're going for a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Diplomacy](Diplomatic Victory) and/or have [Monarchy%20%28Civ6%29](Monarchy) as your government, in which case the Consulate should be built immediately afterwards. Otherwise, this district and building can wait until later into the game when [Spy%20%28Civ6%29](Spies) start to get active.
