# Giant Death Robot (Civ6)

The Giant Death Robot (or GDR) is an [Information%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Information Era) [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23GDR](super-unit) in "". It requires 1 to train and 3 per turn to maintain.
Strategy.
The Giant Death Robot is the end-game tool of destruction for the [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Domination](Domination Victory) seeker. It is titanically strong, attacks from afar and can even move through water without embarking. Despite its great size, it can also pass through [Mountain%20Tunnel%20%28Civ6%29](Mountain Tunnels) and [Qhapaq%20%C3%91an%20%28Civ6%29](Qhapaq Ã‘an).
Unlike every other military unit in the game, the Giant Death Robot does not gain s, but instead gains bonuses and boosts through specific [Technology%20%28Civ6%29](technologies) in the [List%20of%20technologies%20in%20Civ6](tech tree). These include and strength bonuses, the ability to jump over [Mountains%20%28Civ6%29](Mountains), and a bombard-equivalent ranged attack for sieges. When it comes to controls, GDRs function similarly to the [Persian%20%28Civ6%29](Persians') [Immortal%20%28Civ6%29](Immortals) in that they are capable of both ranged and melee attacks, so make sure you click the ranged attack command instead of right-clicking when you want to bombard a city.
However, the Giant Death Robot is not a one-man army. For example, a [Modern%20Armor%20%28Civ6%29](Modern Armor) Army will have a Combat Strength of 112 (which is pretty close to the GDR's), while the GDR itself cannot form [Unit%20%28Civ6%29%23Combining%20units](Corps and Armies). After the update of air units, [Jet%20Fighter%20%28Civ6%29](Jet Fighters) have a Ranged Strength of 110, which will make for decent damage against the GDR (especially with the [Drone%20Air%20Defense%20%28Civ6%29](Drone Air Defense) upgrade). As in "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)", a focused attack by several units will be able to bring down this robot, so don't expect it to defeat everything on its own.
The Giant Death Robot counts as neither a land unit nor a naval unit, which means it will never have to embark/disembark (and thus will not receive extra from [Mathematics%20%28Civ6%29](Mathematics) or the [Great%20Lighthouse%20%28Civ6%29](Great Lighthouse)), exerts [Zone%20of%20control%20%28Civ6%29](zone of control) on both land and water [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles), and is unaffected by all [Great%20General%20%28Civ6%29](Great Generals) and [Great%20Admiral%20%28Civ6%29](Great Admirals) (but is still affected by [Supply%20Convoy%20%28Civ6%29](Supply Convoys)). That also means this unit can never be purchased with (either with the [Grand%20Master%27s%20Chapel%20%28Civ6%29](Grand Master's Chapel) or [Gitarja%20%28Civ6%29](Gitarja's) [List%20of%20leader%20abilities%20in%20Civ6](leader ability)), though it still takes reduced damage from [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class](siege) and [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Bomber](bomber units).
The Giant Death Robot is the only unit that can survive a [Nuclear%20weapons%20%28Civ6%29](nuclear strike). A or does 50 damage to it, but it is immune to damage from fallout.
As powerful as the Giant Death Robot is, building one is both time-consuming and resource-intensive. Its cost will take most cities 15+ turns to finish, though slotting [Integrated%20Attack%20Logistics%20%28Civ6%29](Integrated Attack Logistics) will expedite this. Buying one will cost 6000 , a sum that may take many turns to amass. 3 per turn for maintenance is also quite a lot.
