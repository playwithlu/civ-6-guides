Great Library entry.
Throughout the 20th century, automobile emissions choked the great cities of the world until scientists developed the Fuel Cell. Instead of pouring smoke into the atmosphere, the Fuel Cell generated water and carbon dioxide as waste, no dirtier than the average house pet. Power plants adopted similar technology: the molten carbonate fuel cell. Operating at 55% efficiency or more, these cells generated hot steam and carbon dioxide as a byproduct which drove a gas turbine for extra electrical energy. A new age of clean power had arrived.
