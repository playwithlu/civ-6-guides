# Atlatlist (Civ5)

Game Info.
Unique ranged unit of the [Mayan%20%28Civ5%29](Mayan civilization), available from the start of the game. Replaces the [Archer%20%28Civ5%29](Archer).
Strategy.
The Atlatlist is the only ranged unit in the game available right from the start, even without researching [Archery%20%28Civ5%29](Archery), and besides it is cheaper than the Archer, which it replaces. Having a ranged unit from the start may not sound like much, but it could be a very nice advantage in the hands of a good player, allowing him or her to take out the earliest barbarian camps without fear.Â
