The Rail Launcher offers the space launchâ€”a cheap and easy access to space with minimal polluting side-effects. An electromagnetic field generated within a quarter-mile long tube can launch most units into orbit. The unit will appear inside a cargo pod in space.
Great Library entry.
In the early 22nd century developments in superconductivity revolutionized the economics of space travel with the invention of the Rail Launcher. With this new technology an electrical current generated a directional magnetic field that propelled a vehicle out of the Launcher at several times the speed of sound. Unfortunately, the Rail Launcher required massive amounts of energy to hurl objects into space, indirectly contributing to pollution through power usage and high energy electromagnetic radiation.
