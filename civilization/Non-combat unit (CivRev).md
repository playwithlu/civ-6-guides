There are four kinds of non-combat units: the [Settlers%20%28CivRev%29](Settlers) (which can found new [City%20%28CivRev%29](cities) or increase the [Population%20%28CivRev%29](population) of existing ones), the [Caravan%20%28CivRev%29](Caravan) (which can establish trade routes with other civilizations), and the [Spy%20%28CivRev%29](Spy) (which can steal from or interfere with operations in enemy cities).
