Great Library entry.
The discovery in 2525 of RapidGrow(tm) completed the last piece in the puzzle of immortality. RapidGrow(tm), used Nanites to speed cellular growth and to shape the human cortex. Through the process, a single cell was cloned then placed in a Nanite fluid within a modified artificial womb. Over a two week period, the cell grew from embryo, to child, to mature adult. At the same time, the Nanites imprinted the cerebral cortex with the personality of a full grown human. Immortality was at hand.
