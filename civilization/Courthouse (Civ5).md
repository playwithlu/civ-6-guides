# Courthouse (Civ5)

Game Info.
Special building, only constructable in Occupied [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities).
Unhappiness reduction.
 Occupied cities generate extra , both per in annexed cities (1.34 per , instead of the usual 1 ) and per annexed city, as detailed in the table below:
Note that these penalties may be reduced for the player on lower [Difficulty%20level%20%28Civ5%29](difficulty levels), and for the [AI](AI) on higher difficulty levels.
Building or purchasing a [Courthouse%20%28Civ5%29](Courthouse) will remove the Occupied status and the additional (but not the normal from the s or the city itself), and the city will thereafter function as a normal city in your empire.
Strategy.
The Courthouse is an essential building for aggressive empires. Construct one in each Occupied city as quickly as possible, especially if you're intent upon conquering a bunch of them. Be mindful that its maintenance cost is outrageous!
