# Johannesburg (Civ6)

Johannesburg is an industrial [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-state) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It was added in the [Babylon%20Pack%20%28Civ6%29](Babylon Pack).
Strategy.
[Suzerain%20%28Civ6%29](Suzerainty) of Johannesburg is a strong booster - no more, no less, no caveats. Every [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) improves [Resource%20%28Civ6%29](resources), and every civilization wants as much as it can get its hands on, so Johannesburg will always be in stiff competition.
Note that the bonus is given only once for each resource and only for resources owned within 3 tiles of the city. For best results swap away tiles with duplicate resources to other cities within 3 tiles.
Since the resources need to be improved, cities that are settled directly on a resource and districts built over strategic resources do not provide the bonus. Preserving bonus resources as opposed to harvesting them is also more valuable when suzerain of this city state.
