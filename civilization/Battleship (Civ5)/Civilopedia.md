# Battleship (Civ5)/Civilopedia

Battleships are large, heavily armored warships equipped with multiple guns of the largest caliber. They are direct linear descendants of the ships of the line of the Age of Sail, equipped to do battle with the enemy's largest warships. In the days before air power and submarines battleships ruled the waves, able to sink anything else afloat. Their extremely powerful guns can be used as artillery as well, sending huge missiles miles inland. Despite their size, speed, armor and firepower, battleships were extremely vulnerable to both air and submarine attack. At Pearl Harbor Japanese planes flying from aircraft carriers sank four American battleships and heavily damaged four more. This convinced the Allies of the primacy of the aircraft carrier as an offensive weapon, and battleships were relegated to shore bombardment and carrier escort duties for much of the rest of the war.
