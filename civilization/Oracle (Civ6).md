The Oracle is an {{Link6|Ancient Era}} {{Link6|Wonder}} in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It must be built on {{Link6|Hills}}.
Strategy.
The Oracle is a powerful generalist wonder that every [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) wants to build and exploit, maybe except for pure domination ones who can take it from its owner by force. The numbers on the Oracle are quite deceptive, and may not give you an accurate idea of its strength. A district without any [Building%20%28Civ6%29](buildings) in it will normally give you 1 {{GreatPerson6}} point of its respective type, which the Oracle effectively triples. If you have [Pingala%20%28Educator%29%20%28Civ6%29](Pingala) with his [Grants%20%28Civ6%29](Grants) title in the city as well (which you absolutely should if you built the Oracle), every district will provide 6 {{GreatPerson6}} points per turn before those given by buildings, which makes patronage of {{GreatPeople6}} easier than ever. The {{Faith6}} discount is also a nice touch for civilizations with incentives to build a lot of [Holy%20Site%20%28Civ6%29](Holy Sites), although this isn't the main reason you would build the Oracle. Overall, this is a solid wonder in the base game and an absolute powerhouse in the expansions, since its power suits every civilization for every [Victory%20%20%28Civ6%29](victory) path. 
Note that the Oracle's bonus does not promote the generation of [Great%20Writer%20%28Civ6%29](Great Writers), [Great%20Artist%20%28Civ6%29](Artists), and [Great%20Musician%20%28Civ6%29](Musicians) in the [Lavra%20%28Civ6%29](Lavra).
