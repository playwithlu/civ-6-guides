Civilopedia entry.
Factories are good at one thing and one thing only - production. Often dirty and dangerous, the sole concern of the factory is output. How much can be created in the least amount of time possible? Any factory worker can tell you the correct response is always "more, more, more." Factories will increase production in any Star System in which they are built.
