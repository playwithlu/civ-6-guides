# Drydock (Col)

Drydocks include facilities and equipment for repairing ships and boats that have been damaged in naval combat. There is a drydock in your 
mother country at all times, but your people can construct a drydock in any coastal colony which already contains docks and has a population of 6. Whenever a naval unit is damaged, it is placed automatically in the nearest drydock for repairs.
