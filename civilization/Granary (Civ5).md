# Granary (Civ5)

Game Info.
Basic growth-enhancing [Building%20%28Civ5%29](building) of the [Ancient%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Ancient Era).
Strategy.
The Granary increases the production of a city, speeding up the city's growth, especially if it has one of the above-mentioned [Resources%20%28Civ5%29](resources) nearby (which need not be improved). It's always useful when you want to create a large city, and for speeding up growth of smaller ones. It's also incredibly useful to help cities with poor access to fertile land.
