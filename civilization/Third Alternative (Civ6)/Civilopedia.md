# Third Alternative (Civ6)/Civilopedia

The Third Alternative (or Third Position) is a nationalist political philosophy that emphasizes its opposition to both capitalism and communism, instead synthesizing radical ideas from both. Those following this approach favor state ownership of production and the distribution of goods and services to “the productive members of society,” peaceful segregation of ethnic and racial groups within the state, and have recently embraced radical environmentalism. Classic examples of this philosophy include Sukarno, Nehru, and Nasser.
