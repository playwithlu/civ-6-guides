# Monumentality (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Imperial capitals â€“ cities such as St. Petersburg, Istanbul, Beijing, and Washington DC, are made to remind the visitor that, compared with the scale of national history, the individual is small and temporary. Here, monumentality refers to more than just the buildings themselves, but a state of mind where the scale of construction shows the breadth of empire.
