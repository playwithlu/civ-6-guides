Strategy.
Chinguetti is a city-state which simply helps its [Suzerain%20%28Civ6%29](Suzerain) gain as much as possible, unlike other religious city-states which mostly offer unique [List%20of%20improvements%20in%20Civ6](improvements) or help to spread their [Religion%20%28Civ6%29](religion). This means that it can be useful for other [Victory%20%28Civ6%29](victory) paths, such as buying [Naturalist%20%28Civ6%29](Naturalists) and [Rock%20Band%20%28Civ6%29](Rock Bands) for a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Cultural Victory). It especially shines if you are playing as a [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) that wants to spread its religion but has no special bonuses towards gaining , or if you are playing as a religious civilization that can grow massive populous [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities), such as the [Indian%20%28Civ6%29](Indians) and the [Khmer%20%28Civ6%29](Khmer). The [Malian%20%28Civ6%29](Malians) also have strong synergy with Chinguetti, fittingly - their average city sizes may not be as large, but they usually have many more s. The [Portuguese%20%28Civ6%29](Portuguese) also deserve a mention as they can accumulate s quickly, and their boosted yields from s allow Chinguetti to grant them massive amounts of very early in the game.
