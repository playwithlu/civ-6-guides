# Piopiotahi (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Piopiotahi, known by settlers as Milford Sound, was named by Maori after the now extinct piopio bird - is a magnificent natural fjord on the coast of Te Waipounamu - the South Island of New Zealand. Carved by glaciers, the New Zealand fjordâ€™s cliffs rise vertically from the dark waters while waterfalls fall as much as 1000 meters down the faces. Ignored by early explorers such as Captain James Cook, the fjord was given its English name follwing an obscure spot in Wales by the first to sail into it. In 1888 the MacKinnon Pass was located, giving access to the fjord along the Milford Track, one of the best walking trails in the world. Now as many as three-quarter million visitors a year tramp and sail about the sound, making it the most famous tourist destination in the country.
