# Difficulty level (Civ1)

The difficulty level is a game setting in "[Sid%20Meier%27s%20Civilization](Sid Meier's Civilization)" that allows players to compete against [AI](AI) opponents matched to their skills and desire for challenge. In order from lowest to highest, the difficulty levels are as follows:
Since the computer players are not controlled by advanced AI (i.e., cannot learn from and react to the player's strategies by changing their own accordingly), but instead behave based on a very long list of if-then statements, the game makes the AI [Leaders%20%28Civ1%29](leaders) more challenging opponents by giving them advantages on higher difficulty levels. The bonuses conferred to both human and AI players on each difficulty level are listed in the table below.
All of the information presented here comes from an info page on [CivFanatics](CivFanatics) and the game's data files.
1 The number of people who will be created in a [City%20%28Civ1%29](city) who are born content.
2 The number of rows in the computer player's [Food%20%28Civ1%29](food) storage box (i.e. how long it will take for a city to grow). The number of rows in the human player's box is always 10.
3 All computer players have their costs to build [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ1](units) and [List%20of%20buildings%20in%20Civ1](city improvements) multiplied by this amount.
4 Each time an [List%20of%20advances%20in%20Civ1](advance) is discovered, the cost (in lightbulbs) of acquiring the next increases by this amount.
5 In a parley with another leader, enemy leaders will often demand payment for peace. Note that they will always offer peace at the Chieftan difficulty level, as if the player permanently has the [Great%20Wall%20%28Civ1%29](Great Wall) or [United%20Nations%20%28Civ1%29](United Nations).
6 The score is calculated the same on all difficulty levels. However, when it comes to high score ranking, the final score is converted to a percent in order to account for the difficulty.
