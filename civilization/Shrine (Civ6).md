# Shrine (Civ6)

The Shrine is a basic [Religion%20%28Civ6%29](religious) [Building%20%28Civ6%29](building) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is built in the [Holy%20Site%20%28Civ6%29](Holy Site) [District%20%28Civ6%29](district) (or one of its replacements).
Strategy.
As one of the earliest (and cheapest) available buildings, the Shrine is indispensable for players who wish to found a religion. It adds another point, and it is the only other source of these points besides the Holy Site itself until you gain access to a more advanced [Government%20%28Civ6%29](government) (when you can use the [Revelation%20%28Civ6%29](Revelation) [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](policy card)).
Further along, it allows the purchasing of the first [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Religious](religious unit) in the game, the [Missionary%20%28Civ6%29](Missionary), which allows you to spread your religion.
In "", each religious [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-state) with 3 or more s gives an additional +2 in each Shrine.
