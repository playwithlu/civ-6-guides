Strategy.
The Turtle Ship is an early incarnation of the [Ironclad%20%28Civ5%29](Ironclad) for tactical purposes, and is best used to defend coastlines. Thanks to its high Combat Strength, it can easily fight off enemy Caravels and even [Frigate%20%28Civ5%29](Frigates). Its main drawback is that, unlike the Caravel that it replaces, it can't roam around the [Ocean%20%28Civ5%29](oceans), which means that the Koreans have to wait until they get Frigates to start exploring other continents.
