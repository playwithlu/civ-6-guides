# Marble (Civ5)

Game Info.
Luxury resource. Adds 15% {{Production5}} when building [Ancient%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Ancient)/[Classical%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Classical Era) [Wonder%20%28Civ5%29](wonders) (all wonders in [vanilla](vanilla) "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)" and "") in the city where it is worked.
Strategy.
All this makes {{MarbleIcon5}} Marble a precious resource - try to access it ASAP by researching [Masonry%20%28Civ5%29](Masonry) early on, then use its unique bonus to gain the upper hand in early game wonder construction! Of course, you'll need quite a bit of luck for that - if you don't have {{MarbleIcon5}} Marble near your starting location, you may not be able to make use of it in time.
