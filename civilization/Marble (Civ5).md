# Marble (Civ5)

Game Info.
Luxury resource. Adds 15% when building [Ancient%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Ancient)/[Classical%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Classical Era) [Wonder%20%28Civ5%29](wonders) (all wonders in [vanilla](vanilla) "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)" and "") in the city where it is worked.
Strategy.
 Marble is aÂ unique luxury resource in that besides its normal bonuses, it also provides a boost to wonder construction in the Ancient and Classical Era (or, prior to "", all [Era%20%28Civ5%29](eras)). Its [List%20of%20improvements%20in%20Civ5](improvement), the [Quarry%20%28Civ5%29](Quarry), gives a hefty bonus, and it also enables the nearby [City%20%28Civ5%29](city) to build the [Stone%20Works%20%28Civ5%29](Stone Works), a [Building%20%28Civ5%29](bonus building) which adds additional bonuses to both the city and the tile.
All this makes Marble a precious resource - try to access it ASAP by researching [Masonry%20%28Civ5%29](Masonry) early on, then use its unique bonus to gain the upper hand in early game wonder construction! Of course, you'll need quite a bit of luck for that - if you don't have Marble near your starting location, you may not be able to make use of it in time.
