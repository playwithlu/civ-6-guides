# Impi (Civ4)

The Impi is the [Unique%20unit%20%28Civ4%29](unique unit) of the [Zulu%20%28Civ4%29](Zulu) [Civilizations%20%28Civ4%29](civilization).
Strategy.
Compared to the [Spearman%20%28Civ4%29](Spearman) it replaces, the Impi gains +1 move and starts with the [Mobility%20%28Civ4%29](Mobility) [Promotion%20%28Civ4%29](promotion).
Using Impi.
The Impi can repel any pre-[Medieval%20Era%20%28Civ4%29](Medieval) [List%20of%20mounted%20units%20in%20Civ4](mounted unit) with great ease, due to being as fast as, if not faster than them. This makes the Zulus safe from quick attacks.
The Impi is also a very effective scout unit - able to move quickly into position and look for any oncoming armies, giving the Zulus time to use the [Aggressive%20%28Civ4%29](Aggressive) [Leader%20trait%20%28Civ4%29](trait) and [Ikhanda%20%28Civ4%29](Ikhanda) to form a good defense.
Finally, the Impi can be used for pillaging purposes - being effective against Mounted units, your opponent will have to send a slower retaliation - giving time to escape.
Against Impi.
While Impi have a major speed advantage, they're not any more effective against [Axeman%20%28Civ4%29](Axemen) and can be defeated quickly by them. Stacking Axemen and Spearmen will serve as counters to any quick units the Zulus may send at you if you're attacking them.
