# Biosphère (Civ6)

The Biosphère is a [Atomic%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Atomic Era) [Wonder%20%28Civ6%29](Wonder) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It must be built along a [River%20%28Civ6%29](River) adjacent to a [Neighborhood%20%28Civ6%29](Neighborhood).
Strategy.
The only mainstay bonus of the Biosphère among different game versions is the [Appeal%20%28Civ6%29](Appeal) bonus to [Rainforest%20%28Civ6%29](Rainforest) and [Marsh%20%28Civ6%29](Marsh) [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles). This effect is marginal, as it simply neutralizes the Appeal penalty that Marsh and Rainforest tiles have. If you are playing to maximize Appeal, you are still better off removing Rainforests and Marshes and planting second-growth [Woods%20%28Civ6%29](Woods) (which provide an inherent +1 Appeal to surrounding tiles) after discovering [Conservation%20%28Civ6%29](Conservation). The only [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) that will truly benefit from this aspect is [Brazilian%20%28Civ6%29](Brazil), as their Rainforests will now supply +2 Appeal to adjacent tiles.
In [vanilla](vanilla) "Civilization VI" and "", the Biosphère grants 100 for every Woods, Rainforest, and Marsh tile in the [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) upon completion, which is, frankly, a pathetic bonus. This wonder is unlocked with Synthetic Materials, one of the last [Technology%20%28Civ6%29](technologies) of the game's penultimate [Era%20%28Civ6%29](era), and requires its host city to own at least 19 tiles covered with Rainforest, Marsh, or Woods (or 23 tiles under the "Rise and Fall" ruleset) if you want one free [Information%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Information Era) technology, which is unrealistic. The cost and requirement for the wonder to be adjacent to a Neighborhood mean that you will most likely have to build it in one of your core cities, which tend to be packed with s and wonders at this stage of the game, and clearing features is common practice on high [Difficulty%20level%20%28Civ6%29](difficulty levels) and in [Multiplayer%20%28Civ6%29](multiplayer) games. If you decide to invest in the Biosphère, all of these factors make it incredibly difficult to build it in a city where its bonus will pay off.
In "", the Biosphère becomes an incredible wonder for players who are pursuing a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Cultural Victory). It triples the amount of provided by all renewable sources, which means each [Wind%20Farm%20%28Civ6%29](Wind Farm), [Offshore%20Wind%20Farm%20%28Civ6%29](Offshore Wind Farm), and [Solar%20Farm%20%28Civ6%29](Solar Farm) provides 6 , each [Geothermal%20Plant%20%28Civ6%29](Geothermal Plant) provides 12 , and each [Hydroelectric%20Dam%20%28Civ6%29](Hydroelectric Dam) provides a whopping 18 . Furthermore, all of these improvements and buildings generate based on their supply - for the sake of comparison, a Hydroelectric Dam provides more than a [National%20Park%20%28Civ6%29](National Park) with four Breathtaking tiles, and with the exception of the Geothermal Plant, all other types of improvements have really easy placement rules. The huge amount of also results in your empire no longer having to rely on "dirty" sources of . This makes the Biosphère suitable for players pursuing a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Science](Science Victory) (since they'll be able to build and maintain more [Terrestrial%20Laser%20Station%20%28Civ6%29](Terrestrial Laser Stations)) or a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Diplomacy](Diplomatic Victory) (since they won't have to choose between high yields and a bit of extra ).
Strangely, the Biosphère also provides extra and appropriate for all [Harbor%20%28Civ6%29](Harbor) buildings if you are the [Suzerain%20%28Civ6%29](Suzerain) of [Cardiff%20%28Civ6%29](Cardiff). All Harbor buildings will then provide 6 instead of 2, for a total of 18 for every fully developed Harbor. [City%20Center%20%28Civ6%29](City Centers) also get the additional and with [Synthetic%20Technocracy%20%28Civ6%29](Synthetic Technocracy) and [Aerospace%20Contractors%20%28Civ6%29](Aerospace Contractors), making it much easier to build Terrestrial Laser Stations.
