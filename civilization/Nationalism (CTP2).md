Nationalism is a double-edged sword. One on hand, it can manifest itself in civic pride and community service, and on the other hand can devolve into jingoism and ethnic conflict.
The {{LinkCTP2|Spy}} represents the spirit of nations whose mistrust of others and harmful intentions call forth a subversive information-gathering element.

The development of nationalism marked an important shift in the way people viewed their own participation in political affairs around the world. Since ancient times, people had generally identified themselves with a particular city, region, or ethnic group. It wasn't until the late Renaissance period that Europeans began to formulate the concept of a "nation," a political domain not necessarily defined by proximity or ethnicity. It was not long before national loyalty begat a powerful social force, becoming, in some notable instances, more important even than religious or ethnic affiliations. In large part due to the harmful by-products of nationalism, including jingoism, bigotry, and persecution, it is often considered synonymous with extremism in modern times.
