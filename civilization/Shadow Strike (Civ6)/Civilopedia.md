# Shadow Strike (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Why face the enemy head-on when you can hit them from the side? And if you can do it twice, how much nicer?
This was Hannibal's aim in 216 BCE when facing the Roman army during the Battle of Cannae, allowing the enemy to push forward and seemingly divide his forces. But the Romans would soon find their ranks being smashed from both sides by his African forces.
