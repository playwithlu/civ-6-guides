# Radar (Civ5)

Game Info.
The invention of the Radar, a device capable of tracking objects without visual means many kilometers away, allows further development of many branches of military technology.
The branch that benefits most, for now, is aircraft. We get the next generation of airplanes - the [Fighter%20%28Civ5%29](Fighter) and the [Bomber%20%28Civ5%29](Bomber). We also get the new [Paratrooper%20%28Civ5%29](Paratrooper) infantry, capable of airdropping into enemy territory.
Finally, in "[Brave%20New%20World](Brave New World)" we get the advanced city infrastructure for air travel - the [Airport%20%28Civ5%29](Airport).
