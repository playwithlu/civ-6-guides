# Treasure (Col)

This wagon train carries plunder, usually gold and silver, precious stones, and rare fabrics. Treasure trains are used to cart away the 
plunder gleaned from a native settlement or [LCR](lost city rumor). A [Galleon%20%28Col%29](Galleon) is always required to transport the contents of a treasure train by sea. If you do not have a Galleon, the King will offer to transport the treasure for a portion of the [gold%20%28Col%29](gold).
