Diamond is the hardest and the most abrasive-resistant material known, making diamonds essential parts of the ceramic, electronic, and carbide valve industries. The beauty and brilliance of diamonds have made them the jewel of choice, ever since the art of cutting facets was developed in the 16th century.
