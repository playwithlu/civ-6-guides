# Aquatics Center (Civ6)

The Aquatics Center is an advanced [Amenities%20%28Civ6%29%23Entertainment](entertainment) [Building%20%28Civ6%29](building) in "". It is built in the [Water%20Park%20%28Civ6%29](Water Park) [District%20%28Civ6%29](district) and requires an [Aquarium%20%28Civ6%29](Aquarium) (or one of its replacements).
Strategy.
The Aquatics Center is the only building in the Water Park that requires additional research to build, and provides an impressive +2 to all cities within nine tiles of its district and +2 from all wonders on or adjacent to the coast. Building it in a city that's been used as a "wonder factory" will turn it into a tourist hotspot.
Similar to the area effects of [Stadium%20%28Civ6%29](Stadiums) and [Factory%20%28Civ6%29](Factories), multiple copies of this building within 9 tiles of a City Center will not stack their bonuses.
