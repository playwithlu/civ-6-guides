# Bolshoi Theatre (Civ6)

The Bolshoi Theatre is an in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It must be built on flat land adjacent to a .
Strategy.
The Bolshoi Theatre is best used by anyone aiming to achieve a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Cultural Victory). +2 and points is a decent yield (even better with [Kongolese%20%28Civ6%29](Kongo), which gains +3 points). The [Great%20Work%20%28Civ6%29](Great Work) slots are good for building up and gaining another preciously rare slot for a Great Work of Music.
Since some civics are not required to get to [Opera%20and%20Ballet%20%28Civ6%29](Opera and Ballet), such as [Exploration%20%28Civ6%29](Exploration) and [Reformed%20Church%20%28Civ6%29](Reformed Church), make sure to research these pre-Industrial leaf-civics before finishing the wonder. Otherwise, you may end up having the two free civics earned by building the Bolshoi Theatre wasted on civics you could have easily researched in a few turns.
