# Pollution (Civ3)

Pollution is a problem usually associated with the [Industrial%20Ages%20%28Civ3%29](Industrial Age). It is caused by certain city improvements, the meltdown of a [Nuclear%20Plant%20%28Civ3%29](Nuclear Plant), nuclear explosions, [Volcano%20%28Civ3%29](Volcanic eruptions), and large city populations.
Global Warming.
If world pollution reaches sufficiently critical levels, there is a chance that global warming will occur. It can cause forests and jungles to disappear, and grasslands to become plains, and plains to become desert. World pollution is the sum of all city pollution, nuclear explosions, and meltdowns.
Polluted areas can be cleaned up by [Worker%20%28Civ3%29](Workers), and pollution from cities can be lessened by building the [Mass%20Transit%20System%20%28Civ3%29](Mass Transit System) and the [Recycling%20Center%20%28Civ3%29](Recycling Center).
City Improvements known to cause Pollution.
Also note that while [Hospital%20%28Civ3%29](hospitals) and do not cause pollution directly, they allow a city's population to grow beyond twelve: the point at which population-induced pollution starts to apply.
