# Scout (Civ4)

The Scout is an early-ages exploration unit, which becomes available with [Hunting%20%28Civ4%29](Hunting). [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ4](Civilizations) starting with this [List%20of%20technologies%20in%20Civ4](technology) will get a Scout unit instead of a [Warrior%20%28Civ4%29](Warrior). Scouts are also found in [Tribal%20Village%20%28Civ4%29](Tribal Villages). They upgrade to [Explorer%20%28Civ4%29](Explorers) after researching [Compass%20%28Civ4%29](Compass).
Scouts will defend against enemy attacks but cannot attack on their own.
Strategy.
The Scout can be turned into a "super medic" by attaching a [Great%20General%20%28Civ4%29](Great General) to it and giving it the [Medic%20%28Civ4%29](Medic III) [Promotion%20%28Civ4%29](promotion), allowing him to rapidly heal units on his and adjacent squares.
Use the Scout in the early game to find civilizations in the [Ancient%20Era%20%28Civ4%29](Ancient Era) and to defend against [Barbarian%20%28Civ4%29](barbarians) or [Animal%20%28Civ4%29](animals).
