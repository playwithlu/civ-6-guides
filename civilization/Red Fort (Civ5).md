# Red Fort (Civ5)

Strategy.
In ', the Red Fort acquires the old bonus of the [Kremlin%20%28Civ5%29](Kremlin) wonder. Building it is highly recommended if you're afraid your civilization will be invaded (or if it has been invaded already), and especially if there is a militaristic nation nearby attacking everyone.
Overall, it's a useful for a defensive play. Often, its production cost may not be worth the potential of contemporary buildings or units.
