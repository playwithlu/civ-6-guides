# Nuclear Plant (Civ3)

The Nuclear Plant increases factory output by 100%.
It does not create any [pollution%20%28Civ3%29](pollution). A Factory is required to build a Nuclear Plant.
A city must haves source of fresh water (a river or lake water) within its radius to build a Nuclear Plant. It replaces any other power plant in the city.
Meltdown.
A nuclear power plant has a 50% risk of meltdown whenever the city has been in disorder for at least 1 turn. Otherwise there is no risk of nuclear accident, the power plant won't risk meltdown if it just entered into disorder but can do so if it remained in disorder for at least 1 turn. A meltdown will half the city size and spew also [Pollution%20%28Civ3%29](Pollution) randomly on to nearby tiles in the city radius, but otherwise will leave tile improvements and city improvements undamaged.
