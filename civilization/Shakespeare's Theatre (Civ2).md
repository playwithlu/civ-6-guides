Most of the plays of William Shakespeare were first performed on the stage of London's Globe Theatre during the 1600s. Theatres offered people a diversion from their everyday lives by allowing them to enjoy comedies, tragedies, and triumphs acted out on stage. Similar theaters, such as the Comedie Francaise in Paris, and La Scala in Milan, fulfilled similar roles by offering entertainment to the citizens of their cities. Although the original Globe Theatre burned down, Shakespeare's plays are still performed in a new theatre bearing his name, and in other theatres throughout the world.
