The origins of the early Warrior go back to before the Later Stone Age (Neo-Lithic period) In the Prehistoric times. Where it is theorized that the settling of disputes led to a highly ritualized form of warfare. Warfare continued for thousands of years, expanding in complexity and developing into an elaborate and organized system involving the sophisticated use of military strategy. Sun Tzu coined the Phrase "To subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill."
