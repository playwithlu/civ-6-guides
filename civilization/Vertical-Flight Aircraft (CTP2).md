Gameplay.
Vertical-Flight Aircraft do not need a runway to take off and land, and are well suited to military operations in which the luxury of an airstrip is too much to bear. The is such an aircraft. It is capable of ferrying several units through the air.
Great Library entry.
Inventors dreamed for centuries of vehicles that could fly vertically, fly horizontally to its destination and then land vertically. Indeed, this flight system is far more logical and efficient than conventional fixed-wing flight systems with their large landing fields and limited range. However, vertical flight demands more sophisticated control and power systems than fixed-wing aircraft. Engineers and inventors overcame these demands and began to produce useful helicopters in the early 1940s.
Helicopters significantly affected military operations in the Korean and Vietnam Wars. They fielded air-mobile infantry units, evacuated casualties, hauled artillery and ammunition, rescued downed aviators, and served as ground-attack craft. Manufacturers eventually fitted helicopters with gas-turbine engines, which vastly improved their operational range, effectiveness and capacity.
