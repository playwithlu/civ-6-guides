# Jungle (CTP2)

Jungle is a type of [Terrain%20%28CTP2%29](terrain) in "[Call%20to%20Power%20II](Call to Power II)". [Medicinal%20Herbs%20%28CTP2%29](Medicinal Herbs) and [Jade%20%28CTP2%29](Jade) can be found here.
Gameplay.
Rain Forests have an abundance of natural resources, making available small amounts of {{LinkCTP2|Food}}, substantial {{LinkCTP2|Production}} and a minimum of {{LinkCTP2|Commerce}}. A {{LinkCTP2|River}} enhances the bonuses. {{LinkCTP2|Farming}} and {{LinkCTP2|Mining}} are both impossible, but one can build Commerce improvements such as {{LinkCTP2|Trading Posts}} and {{LinkCTP2|Shopping Malls}}. {{LinkCTP2|Roads}} are strongly advised, as unaided movement through this terrain is slow.
The discovery of {{LinkCTP2|Agricultural Revolution}} enables {{LinkCTP2|Terraforming}} of Rain Forest tiles.
