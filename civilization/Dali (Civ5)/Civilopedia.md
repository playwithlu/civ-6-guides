# Dali (Civ5)/Civilopedia

Located in the modern Yunnan Province of China, the kingdom of Dali was founded in 937 AD after a period of turbulent, smaller dynasties. The kingdom's territory lent itself naturally to defense, and it was said that just a few men could protect the valley for years. This claim seems to hold some truth, as the Mongols attempted repeatedly to invade the kingdom, all unsuccessfully. Records show that the Mongolian army eventually located a traitor from Dali to lead them over the mountains through a secret passage, finally giving them the means to overrun the impregnable defenses. In 1253 the Mongols completed their invasion of the state, eventually creating the Province of Yunnan in 1274.
