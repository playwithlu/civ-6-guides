# Yerevan (Civ6)

Yerevan is a religious [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-state) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
Yerevan can play a pivotal role in religious expansion. Being able to choose your Apostle promotions is gamechanging, allowing any player to avoid the randomly-given "useless" promotions such as [Indulgence%20Vendor%20%28Civ6%29](Indulgence Vendor) or [Chaplain%20%28Civ6%29](Chaplain) in favour of [Proselytizer%20%28Civ6%29](Proselytizer), [Translator%20%28Civ6%29](Translator), and [Debater%20%28Civ6%29](Debater). The difference between being on the receiving end and the delivery end of [Apostle%20%28Civ6%29](Apostle) units with Debater is a game changer, making Yerevan a good reason not to spend {{EnvoyIcon6}} Envoys frivolously on mediocre city states.
