# Harald Hardrada (Civ6)

Harald III (c. 1015 – 25 September 1066), also known as Harald Sigurdsson or by his epithet Hardrada (meaning "hard ruler"), was from 1046 until his death, also known for leading the [Byzantine](Byzantine) , and for his invasion and attempted takeovers of [Danish](Denmark) and [English](England). He leads the [Norwegian%20%28Civ6%29](Norwegians) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Hardrada is a naval power like [English%20%28Civ6%29](England) and [Spanish%20%28Civ6%29](Spain), though he strives to dominate the seas as a springboard for his quick Norwegian strike on [Coastal%20%28Civ6%29](coastal) targets.
This is the standard version of Harald Hardrada when players do not have the [Rulers%20of%20England%20Pack%20%28Civ6%29](Rulers of England Pack) enabled. When it is enabled, Harald will be split into two alternate [Persona%20%28Civ6%29](personas): [Harald%20Hardrada%20%28Civ6%29/Varangian](Varangian Harald Hardrada), with a new appearance and abilities; and Konge Harald Hardrada, using his former model and abilities.
Intro.
 All men fear the approach of your ships, King Harald of Norway, Thunderbolt of the North. Your longboats dominate the waves, always at the ready to unleash their berserker armies on an unsuspecting shore. May Odin bless your kingdom and may the skalds sing tales of the victories of your mighty warriors.
In-Game.
Harald Hardrada's unique [Agenda%20%28Civ6%29](agenda) is Last Viking King. He wants to build a strong navy, respecting civilizations with a strong navy, and disliking civilizations with weak navies.
His [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader ability) is Thunderbolt of the North. It gives him 50% bonus toward and enables [Combat%20%28Civ6%29%23Coastal%20Raid](coastal raiding) for [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Naval%20melee](naval melee units), and allows him to produce the [Viking%20Longship%20%28Civ6%29](Viking Longship), a [Unique%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](unique unit) that replaces the [Galley%20%28Civ6%29](Galley). In "", it also provides him with extra rewards for pillaging or coastal raiding [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](tile improvements): from [Mine%20%28Civ6%29](Mines), from [Camp%20%28Civ6%29](Camps), [Pasture%20%28Civ6%29](Pastures), [Plantation%20%28Civ6%29](Plantations), and [Quarry%20%28Civ6%29](Quarries).
Detailed Approach.
Hardrada is the bully of the seas. He picks on civilizations with weak navies, dominating them with his large navies, raiding their [Coast%20%28Civ6%29](coasts), and if their coastal [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) aren't protected well enough, striking to conquer them as well. He's especially dangerous in the Medieval period when both the Longship and [Berserker%20%28Civ6%29](Berserker) are active. [Religion%20%28Civ6%29](Religion) (powered by [Stave%20Church%20%28Civ6%29](Stave Churches)) isn't usually his typical emphasis, though there are nice complementary Enhancer Beliefs (Crusade for example) that can complement his military campaigns.
Lines.
Harald Hardrada is voiced by [Atli%20Rafn%20Sigur%C3%B0sson](Atli Rafn Sigurðsson). He speaks with some anachronistic modern Icelandic pronunciations. For instance, the vowels "y" and "æ" are pronounced incorrectly as they have changed quite a bit from Old Norse to modern Icelandic.
