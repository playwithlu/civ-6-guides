Intro.
 Queen Dido, mother of Carthage, all your life you faced great threats and overcame them through wit and cunning. Wherever waves break on the shore, there your cities shall rise. The seas are your roads, the far horizon is your destiny and your refuge.

Detailed Approach.
Phoenicia needs to get [Bireme%20%28Civ6%29](Biremes) and embarked [Settler%20%28Civ6%29](Settlers) into play as early as possible. The combination of these two [Units%20%28Civ6%29](units) allows Dido to quickly settle and protect an empire of interconnected coastal cities.
