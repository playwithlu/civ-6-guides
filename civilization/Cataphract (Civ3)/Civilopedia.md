# Cataphract (Civ3)/Civilopedia

The Byzantine Empire, as the continuation of the Roman Empire, maintained the legions, however, while they found
that the legions were remarkably adept as they were in dealing with the barbarians of the west, they were unable
to compete with the mounted archers of the east. After an extended period of dependence on Teutonic and Hunnish
mercenary cavalry, the reforms of emperors Maurice and Heraclius in the 6th and 7th centuries developed a
provincial militia based on the institution of pronoia, the award of nonhereditary grants of land capable of
supporting an armored horse archer called a cataphract. The Byzantine cataphract was armed with a bow, lance,
sword and dagger, and wore a shirt of mail or scale armor (the cataphract, from which the warriors took their name).
This armor was so heavy that even halberds, pikes, and other counter-cavalry polearms had trouble penetrating it.
In addition to their suit of armor, cataphracts also wore an iron helm and carried a small, round, ironbound shield
of wood that could be strapped to the forearm or slung from the waist. The cataphractsâ€™ horses were carefully bred
over the centuries to be the perfect warhorse, and were heavily armored as well, creating tremendous mass for the
initial impact of the charge. Cataphracts used both missile tactics and shock tactics, and became the mainstay of
the Byzantine army. This elite cavalry was employed for over 600 years.
