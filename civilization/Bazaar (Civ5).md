# Bazaar (Civ5)

Game Info.
[Unique%20building%20%28Civ5%29](Unique building) of the [Arabian%20%28Civ5%29](Arabian) [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilization). Replaces the [Market%20%28Civ5%29](Market).
Strategy.
The Bazaar is one of the best unique buildings in the game. It not only increases the available count of each [Luxury%20resource%20%28Civ5%29](luxury resource), but also adds extra production for [Oasis%20%28Civ5%29](Oases) and resources! Since both of those are often found in [Desert%20%28Civ5%29](deserts) (for which the Arabians have a [Starting%20bias%20%28Civ5%29](starting bias)), Arabian players should consider settling many [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities) where they can potentially use these bonuses.
