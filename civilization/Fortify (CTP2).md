# Fortify (CTP2)

Most land-based military [List%20of%20units%20in%20CTP2](units) can Fortify on a tile for a {{LinkCTP2|Defense}} bonus. The Fortification process takes a few turns to complete. Once a unit is fortified (a small wall around the unit, similar to the {{LinkCTP2|Fortification}} {{LinkCTP2|Tile Improvement}}, indicates that the unit is Fortified) it enjoys an additional {{LinkCTP2|Defense}} bonus beyond any given by the terrain.
