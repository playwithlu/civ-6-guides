# Frederick Barbarossa (Civ6)

Frederick I (1122 – 10 June 1190), better known as Frederick Barbarossa (meaning "red beard"), a nickname given to him by the [Italian](Italian)s he spent most of his rule warring with, was and from 1155 until his death. His many political and military accomplishments made him a legendary figure both during and after his time, and one of the most celebrated Holy Roman Emperors. He leads the [German%20%28Civ6%29](Germans) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
As in history, Germany under Frederick Barbarossa is a powerhouse that can threaten to overwhelm its foes with their productivity and military prowess.
In-Game.
Frederick Barbarossa's unique [Agenda%20%28Civ6%29](agenda) is Iron Crown. He does not like [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) that are [Suzerain%20%28Civ6%29](Suzerains) with or have conquered [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-states), since he would like to conquer them, and likes those who do not associate with city-states.
His [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader ability) is Holy Roman Emperor. It provides him with an additional {{MilitaryPolicy6}} Military policy slot and +7 {{Strength6}} Combat Strength for [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](units) fighting city-states.
Detailed Approach.
German [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) can become productive quickly, adding a second, third, and subsequent {{District6}}s many turns earlier than their foes. Nearby city-states can easily be absorbed into Frederick's "Holy Roman Empire." Look for him to attack a city-state with fertile lands and [Resource%20%28Civ6%29](resources) rather than trying to spend the time to woo it diplomatically. In the [Modern%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Modern era), Germany adds the [U-Boat%20%28Civ6%29](U-Boat), a premier unit designed to economically disrupt their foes. With their heavy industrial base, Germany can then press forward to [Victory%20%28Civ6%29](victory) on any front that they choose.

Invitation to Capital: I will show you our great capital if you tell me how yours can possibly compare to Germany's seat of power.
Invitation to City: As the Holy Roman Emperor, I welcome you to our land. If you wish, you can see some of its glory in the nearest city. Unless, of course, they are rebelling again.
Rejects Player's Declaration of Friendship: No, I cannot accept your friendship, for the good of the Empire.
Accepts Player's Declaration of Friendship: A strong ally is the greatest friend. Let us live in peace.
Requests a Declaration of Friendship: Again we extend our hand, but this time in friendship. Will you accept it?
Player Accepts His Declaration of Friendship: Thank you, friend.
Player Rejects His Declaration of Friendship: Perhaps next time, then.
Denounced by Player: I should answer you with my sword… perhaps I will.
Denounces Player: The world will know of your treachery. And you will be judged.
Accepts Delegation from Player: Your envoy arrived and I welcomed them personally. Our Empire could benefit from diplomacy.
Rejects Delegation from Player: No, of course not.
Sends Delegation to Player: We have sent a diplomatic envoy to you. Treat them as you would treat me, the Duke of Swabia, King of Burgundy, King of Germany, King of the Romans, King of Italy, and Holy Roman Emperor.
Accepts Player's Open Border Agreement: I will allow it, for the good of Germany, I hope.
Rejects Player's Open Border Agreement: I was not born a fool, to allow my enemies passage through my lands.
Requests Open Border Agreement: I must move my army through your land. Will you allow it?
Too Many Troops near His Border: If you think we are blind to your army, you are naive. Move them away from Germany, or suffer the consequences.
