Summary.
The final of the Mechanical Advances, Nano-Assembly exceeds old limitations, synthesizing new materials atom by atom. In special Nanite Factories built only in space, assembly costs plummet: Rush Buy costs equal costs of production. With the Nanopedia, which doubles the effects of all specialists and the Nanite Defuser, which ends the threat of nuclear war by eliminating Nukes, Nano-Assembly offers a new hope for the future.
Great Library entry.
The 23rd century crowned a king of the future: nanotechnology. Nanotechnology, a science relying on the creation of tiny machines the size of atoms or "motorized DNA," became the magic of a new generation, literally making anything possible. Nanites could do anything from clean the air to spontaneously form to create a book, a television, a doll, a disease. Nanotechnology changed the way we view production, machine, and matter.
