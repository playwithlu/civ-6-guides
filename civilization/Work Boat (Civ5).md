# Work Boat (Civ5)

Game Info.
Naval civilian unit.
Strategy.
The Work Boat is a naval unit, which means that it can only be constructed in [Coastal%20%28Civ5%29](coastal) [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities). It can be used to improve water [Resources%20%28Civ5%29](resources) such as and (+1 ), (+1 ), and (+3 ). The Work Boat is consumed when it constructs the [List%20of%20improvements%20in%20Civ5](improvement), so improving multiple water resources will require multiple Work Boats.
Work Boats can't enter [Ocean%20%28Civ5%29](ocean) tiles until [Astronomy%20%28Civ5%29](Astronomy) is discovered. Work Boats cannot engage in combat and are immediately destroyed if an enemy enters their tile, so use them immediately or defend them if there's danger nearby.
