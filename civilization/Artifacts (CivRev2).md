# Artifacts (CivRev2)

Artifacts are special [Tile%20%28CivRev2%29](tiles) scattered throughout the world in "[Civilization%20Revolution%202](Civilization Revolution 2)". They are randomly placed on the [Map%20%28CivRev2%29](map) at the beginning of the game.
A player can discover an artifact by moving a [List%20of%20units%20in%20CivRev2](unit) over its tile, which will trigger the artifact's effect. Most artifacts have effects that provide players with substantial advantages if they are found early in the game.
