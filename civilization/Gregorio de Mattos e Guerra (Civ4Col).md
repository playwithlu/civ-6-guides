# Gregorio de Mattos e Guerra (Civ4Col)

Civilopedia.
Lived: 1636-1696
Gregorio de Mattos e Guerra was a Brazilian lawyer-turned-poet known for his satirical views of Brazilian society. Born in 1636 in Bahia, Brazil, Guerra traveled to Portugal to receive his education. After his graduation from the University of Coimbra, Guerra married and received an appointment to a judicial position in Portugal. Yet neither his marriage nor his appointment would last, and Guerra returned to Brazil a few years later with neither job nor wife. Upon returning to Bahia, Guerra began to criticize much he saw around him, creating a library of satirical writing and poems capturing the foibles of contemporary Brazil. Guerra's writings would get him into much trouble, eventually leading his to exile in Angola. He would return to Brazil years later, dying not long after his final return to his homeland.
