# Collective Rule (Civ5)

Collective Rule is a [Social%20policies%20%28Civ5%29](social policy) in "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)". It is part of the [Liberty%20%28Civ5%29](Liberty) tree. In the expansions, it requires [Republic%20%28Civ5%29](Republic); in Vanilla, it is instead initially available and actually was a prerequisite for Republic.
Giving people the right to vote and decide the matters governing their life, instead of, say, a single despot doing whatever he decides, is the first step towards freedom. So important is this step that the of your empire becomes a brewing pot of expansionism, and people are ready to establish new cities right away!
Strategy.
With the expansions, this policy is level 2. But still, if you rush it and adopt it as a third policy you will gain a free [Settler%20%28Civ5%29](Settler) without having the need to sacrifice Population growth in your starting city in the all-important first 20-30 turns. Building a Settler at that point usually takes 10+ turns, which makes this Policy a game changer - you not only will continue to grow your Population, but also manage to construct something else in this time! And of course, the other bonus will greatly facilitate future expansion.
