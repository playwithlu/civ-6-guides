# Lost City of Atlantis (CivRev)

The Lost City of Atlantis is an [Artifacts%20%28CivRev%29](artifact) in "[Civilization%20Revolution](Civilization Revolution)".
Gameplay.
Discovery of the Lost City of Atlantis Artifact will touch off a golden age of discovery in your Civilization. Your scientists will immediately complete the research on several new technologies! 
Unlike other artifacts, Atlantis will activate when a player's unit is moved to an adjacent [Tile%20%28CivRev%29](tile). 
The technologies gained are always the three least expensive technologies the Civ has access to. In the case of the very late game in which all technologies are already acquired, The Lost City of Atlantis will yield three copies of Future technology. 
This is a great way to start off a Technological Victory. The Lost City of Atlantis is always found in deep waters, so a Galleon (alternatively, a Galley with a completed Lighthouse of Alexandria Wonder) is necessary to claim the Artifact. Because they start with Navigation, the Spanish are best suited to find the Lost City of Atlantis early.
Civilopedia entry.
The mythic lost continent, Atlantis has long fascinated the mystic and explorer alike with its tales of riches and idyllic life. Tales of this sunken city stem from an account written by Plato which mentions a great state that attempted to invade Athens only to sink below the sea. Since Plato's account, Atlantis has become a staple for myth fans and conspiracy junkies alike and divers continue to prowl the seas in hopes of discovering the land below the tides.
