# Aluminum (Civ5)

Game Info.
Advanced late-game strategic resource. Used by powerful late-game [Unit%20%28Civ5%29](units).
Strategy.
Try to plan your late-game expansions so that you ensure access to this important resource. {{AluminumIcon5}} Aluminum is accessed with the [Mine%20%28Civ5%29](Mine) and conveys the usual benefits to {{Production5}}. {{AluminumIcon5}} Aluminum can also be gained by building a [Recycling%20Center%20%28Civ5%29](Recycling Center).
Lastly, all six parts of the [Spaceship%20%28Civ5%29](spaceship) require {{AluminumIcon5}} Aluminum to build. Since each part stops consuming the resource when it is added, it is possible to complete the spaceship with just one unit of {{AluminumIcon5}} Aluminum. Be sure to plan accordingly.
