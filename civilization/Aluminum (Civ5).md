Strategy.
 Aluminum is discovered about the same time as , with the [Electricity%20%28Civ5%29](Electricity) [List%20of%20technologies%20in%20Civ5](technology). Aluminum sources are more common than sources, found in the more conventional locations as a general rule, and they're also much easier to find than sources.
Try to plan your late-game expansions so that you ensure access to this important resource. Aluminum is accessed with the [Mine%20%28Civ5%29](Mine) and conveys the usual benefits to . Aluminum can also be gained by building a [Recycling%20Center%20%28Civ5%29](Recycling Center).
 Aluminum is used a bit differently than the military-only : some late-game economic [Building%20%28Civ5%29](buildings), such as the [Hydro%20Plant%20%28Civ5%29](Hydro Plant), also require it. In the [Information%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Information Era), many military vehicles start to use Aluminum instead of , vastly increasing its consumption.
Lastly, all six parts of the [Spaceship%20%28Civ5%29](spaceship) require Aluminum to build. Since each part stops consuming the resource when it is added, it is possible to complete the spaceship with just one unit of Aluminum. Be sure to plan accordingly.
