Strategy.
Shrewd and fiscally knowledgeable, Reyna is able to strengthen the economic power of a city, using finances to provide more than is normally possible.
Reyna is a flexible Governor with a starting title that is useful for any new city for any civilization (and later on, the Contractor promotion allows new cities to quickly buy s). However, her promotions are geared towards trade (particularly maritime) and -oriented civilizations, such as the [Dutch%20%28Civ6%29](Netherlands) and [English%20%28Civ6%29](England). Reyna's Tax Collector promotion, however, suggests that the city she establishes herself in should have a high population, pushing the player to have only [Commercial%20Hub%20%28Civ6%29](Commercial Hubs) and [Harbor%20%28Civ6%29](Harbors) for districts, if any at all, the remainder of that city's [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles) being filled with [Farm%20%28Civ6%29](Farms). Finally, it is important to note that her Curator promotion does not include from Relics, especially if you are playing as [Polish%20%28Civ6%29](Poland).
With "[Gathering%20Storm](Gathering Storm)", Reyna receives more climate-oriented promotions. Her Foreign Exchange promotion's effects are instead unlocked upon appointment, and Forestry Management takes its place. This new promotion is very valuable to civilizations pursuing a Culture Victory, adding yield to unimproved features like forests and [Appeal%20%28Civ6%29](Appeal) to tiles adjacent to unimproved features (even unlikely features like [Ice%20%28Civ6%29](Ice) and [Impact%20Zone%20%28Civ6%29](Impact Zone) get a bonus Appeal), allowing [National%20Parks%20%28Civ6%29](National Parks) and [Seaside%20Resort%20%28Civ6%29](Seaside Resorts) to be placed on more tiles and provide . She also has her Curator promotion given to [Pingala%20%28Educator%29%20%28Civ6%29](Pingala), the Educator, which is replaced with Renewable Subsidizer, making green energy sources more valuable by increasing their and output.
