# Landsknecht (Civ4)

The Landsknecht is the [Unique%20unit%20%28Civ4%29](unique unit) of the [Holy%20Roman%20%28Civ4%29](Holy Roman) [Civilizations%20%28Civ4%29](civilization).
Strategy.
Compared to the [Pikeman%20%28Civ4%29](Pikeman), which the Landsknecht replaces, it is twice as effective against [Melee%20unit%20%28Civ4%29](Melee units).
Using Landsknecht.
Landskecht are cheaper than [Maceman%20%28Civ4%29](Macemen) and at face value, are an even match. However, they're weak at attacking [City%20%28Civ4%29](cities), due to the lack of a bonus against ranged units. Therefore, they work best in defense - which helps compliment the low-[Maintenance%20%28Civ4%29](maintenance) defensive city-building nature of the Holy Roman Empire.
Mass-producing Pikemen to defend against would-be pillagers could be a huge waste of time normally, but with the huge bonus of Landsknecht, they can be put to other purposes, such as defending a city-attacking stack.
Against Landsknecht.
[Engineering%20%28Civ4%29](Engineering) is a fairly awkward [List%20of%20technologies%20in%20Civ4](technology) to pick up, due to its reliance on high-cost previous technologies. As such, a Holy Roman Empire player needs a good research base to make these units really shine. Take out the commerce-based cities earlier on, and you delay these units that little bit further.
They may be effective against Melee and Mounted units, but they have no advantage against [Archery%20unit%20%28Civ4%29](Archery units). Use [Crossbowman%20%28Civ4%29](Crossbowmen) against them to hit their weak spot.
