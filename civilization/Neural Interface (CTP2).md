The Neural Interface is a triumph of biotechnology, allowing humans to connect their brains to computers. This Advance precludes the need for the cumbersome interface devices like keyboards, monitors and mice that are traditionally associated with computers.
The {{LinkCTP2|Cyber Ninja}} uses a neural interface to jack into systems, conducting espionage operations at the speed of thought.
The {{LinkCTP2|VR Amusement Park}} is an entertainment venue like no other, enabling people to transport themselves into any consciousness they desire.
Great Library entry.
The genetics research of the early 21st century unconcealed many of the mysteries surrounding the human central nervous system. Although doctors and scientists were well aware of its electrical nature, they could only speculate on the way in which they could enable the nervous system to intelligently interact with other electrical systems.
In 2016, the genetics research firm, Intrinsic Systems, headed by artificial intelligence expert and geneticist Richard Myers, created the first functional prototype for a neural interface. The test subjects were able to manipulate a pointer device on a computer screen by thinking of where they wanted it to go. The neural interface interpreted the electrochemical impulses in their brains and translated them into commands the computer could understand. 
This technological breakthrough garnered Myers widespread acclaim, and enabled him to secure funding for a more ambitious interface device. Within two years, the first commercial neural interface devices hit the market. Although these devices were designed to be worn or attached to the head, by 2019 the military had developed a highly classified, internal neural interface that enabled faster and more sophisticated neural manipulation of complex systems.
