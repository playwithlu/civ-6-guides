Strategy.
There's not much special about the Hoplite, besides its greater combat strength compared to the ordinary Spearman. Use it in the early game to obtain advantage over the enemy, especially if they utilize lots of mounted units. It is particularly useful against civs like the [Mongolian%20%28Civ5%29](Mongolians), who utilize lots of mounted units early game.
