 is a building in "[Final%20Frontier](Final Frontier)", a mod in "".
Strategy.
A Capital Shipyard allows the construction of Carriers, Battleships and Cruisers, making it vital to a Civilization wanting to build the most powerful starships.
Civilopedia entry.
While smaller ships can be built planetside and launched from the ground, larger vessels such as Carriers, Battleships and Cruisers require an above-atmosphere Shipyard to allow for proper construction. The original off-world Shipyard was essentially a glorified space elevator, shifting goods and laborers to work on the space-moored starships. Today's Capital Shipyards much more closely mimic the military ports of the seventeenth century, with entire economies blossoming to create and maintain the Capital Ships of a Star System's fleet.
