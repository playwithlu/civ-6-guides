Strategy.
Al-Zahrawi is a Great Scientist wholly unlike most that are able to be recruited. His ability is essentially that of an immortal, maintenance-free [Medic%20%28Civ6%29](Medic) three [Era%20%28Civ6%29](eras) early, which allows him to act similarly as a strong accessory to conquest. As a {{GreatPerson6}}, he also has twice the {{Moves6}} of a Medic and can be instantly transported between his owner's [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities), making him better able to navigate rough [Terrain%20%28Civ6%29](terrain) to reach wounded [Military%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](military units) and reinforce an army when waging war on multiple fronts. He is especially strong alongside units that already have methods of healing themselves, such as [Mamluk%20%28Civ6%29](Mamluks) or [Toa%20%28Civ6%29](Toa). In the [Secret%20Societies%20%28Civ6%29](Secret Societies) [Game%20mode%20%28Civ6%29](game mode), the [Vampire%20%28Civ6%29](Vampire) can also benefit greatly from the extra healing, as it offsets their own reduced healing. It is definitely worth trying to recruit Al-Zahrawi if you're aiming for a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Domination](Domination Victory).
