# Harold Godwinson (Civ5)/Civilopedia

Harold Godwinson was briefly the King of England, ruling from January 1066 until his defeat at the Battle of Hastings in October of that same year, and was the last of the Anglo-Saxon kings. Despite having successfully warded off the invasion of Harald Hardrada in the north, Godwinson and his army would be obliterated in a day-long battle less than a month later by William the Conqueror. Godwinson, legend has it, fell to an arrow through the eye.
