Strategy.
Each Piopiotahi tile provides +1 and +1 to adjacent non-wonder tiles (see diagram). However, as with all impassable wonders, the individual wonder tiles of Piopiotahi offer no benefits, and cannot be developed or improved. Piopiotahi is usually most effective when it is near the outskirts of a (or even slightly beyond its borders), since the wonder tiles themselves are functionally dead space. If a city is strategically placed in this fashion, it receives the adjacency benefits of the wonder without sacrificing valuable space.
Note that the wonder tiles can be incorporated into s - if a player wishes to found a Park, then it may be more efficient to place the city nearer the wonder.
