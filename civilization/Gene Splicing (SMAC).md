# Gene Splicing (SMAC)

Widespread adoption of the philosophy of [Ethical%20Calculus%20%28SMAC%29](Ethical Calculus) removes opposition to genetic experimentation in plant and animal DNA, while advances in [Biogenetics%20%28SMAC%29](Biogenetics) provide techniques for the incipient field of Gene Splicing. This technology allows researchers to insert new DNA coding into existing genetic material so that entire traits, from disease resistance to a stable personality, can be copied from one organism and transferred to any number of others.
