Simply put, Hypatia is one of the best Great Scientists in the game. Along with [Isaac%20Newton%20%28Civ6%29](Isaac Newton) and [Albert%20Einstein%20%28Civ6%29](Albert Einstein) in later [Era%20%28Civ6%29](eras), Hypatia offers a flat bonus to one of the [Campus%20%28Civ6%29](Campus's) main [Building%20%28Civ6%29](buildings) - in her case, the Library. A 50% boost to the output of all Libraries in your empire makes Hypatia a must-contest for any scientifically-minded players, although she can often be hard to obtain on higher [Difficulty%20level%20%28Civ6%29](difficulty levels). She is best activated in a newly-built Campus to save on costs.
