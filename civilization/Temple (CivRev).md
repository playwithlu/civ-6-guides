Civilopedia entry.
Although they may call them by different names - church, synagogue or mosque - almost all religions have some form of temple: a building where the faithful come to worship. Temples sometimes also serve as schools, hospitals, and/or soup kitchens, serving the physical and intellectual as well as spiritual needs of the people.
