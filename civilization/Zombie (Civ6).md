# Zombie (Civ6)

The Zombie is a [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Melee](melee unit) from the [Zombie%20Defense%20%28Civ6%29](Zombie Defense) [Game%20mode%20%28Civ6%29](game mode) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
The undead can rise up out of the ground with the new Zombie Defense game mode, and this time, as a ravenous zombie that's hungry for the brains of the closest living [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](unit) in the area! Zombies can make more of themselves when they kill another unit, and get stronger when a Zombie is killed. Don't worry - the living aren't entirely defenseless. You can use [Project%20%28Civ6%29](projects) like [Turn%20Undead%20%28Civ6%29](Turn Undead) and [Dark%20Signal%20%28Civ6%29](Dark Signal) to take control of your brainless foes, or fight back with [Trap%20%28Civ6%29](Traps) and [Barricade%20%28Civ6%29](Barricades) built by [Builder%20%28Civ6%29](Builders) and [Military%20Engineer%20%28Civ6%29](Military Engineers).
Since Zombies count as [Barbarian%20%28Civ6%29](Barbarians), a player with [Boudica%20%28Civ6%29](Boudica), an [Apostle%20%28Civ6%29](Apostle) with [Heathen%20Conversion%20%28Civ6%29](Heathen Conversion), or playing as [Qin%20Shi%20Huang%20%28Civ6%29/Unifier](Qin Shi Huang (Unifier)) can easily gain control of a large horde of Zombies. Boudica can also help in identifying where Zombies are, even in the [fog%20of%20war](fog of war). With Unifier Qin Shi Huang, newly converted Zombies will also have a charge of Barbarian Conversion, allowing a rapid multiplication.
Zombies do not attack [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Civilian](civilian units), only [Military%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](military units) and city defenses. Therefore, if there are only Zombies but no other Barbarian units around, players can try to use civilian units to block their way, protect {{District6}}s and [Resource%20%28Civ6%29](resources), or form a barrier around [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Ranged](ranged units) to attack them. Likewise, Zombies cannot enter water unless controlled by a player, so [Harbor%20%28Civ6%29](Harbors) and [Water%20Park%20%28Civ6%29](Water Parks) are safe from them and [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Naval%20ranged](naval ranged units) can attack them with impunity.
In the [Apocalypse%20%28Civ6%29](Apocalypse) game mode, you can use a [Soothsayer%20%28Civ6%29](Soothsayer) to sacrifice Zombies you control to an active [Volcano%20%28Civ6%29](Volcano) during an [Appease%20the%20Gods%20%28Civ6%29](Appease the Gods) [Competition%20%28Civ6%29](competition). Each Zombie sacrificed in this way awards 20 points (since they have a base {{Strength6}} Combat Strength of 20).
