Ice is a type of [Terrain%20%28Civ5%29%23Terrain%20Features](terrain feature) in "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)".
Game Info.
Terrain feature found on [Coast%20%28Civ5%29](Coast) and [Ocean%20%28Civ5%29](Ocean) tiles in the extreme north/south regions of the world.
Strategy.
Ice is found in [Water%20%28Civ5%29](water) tiles at the northernmost and southernmost edges of [Map%20%28Civ5%29](maps). It cannot be [Work%20%28Civ5%29](worked) and prevents the passage of all [Naval%20unit%20%28Civ5%29](naval units) except [Submarine%20%28Civ5%29](Submarines) and [Nuclear%20Submarine%20%28Civ5%29](Nuclear Submarines).
If you found a [Coastal%20%28Civ5%29](coastal) [City%20%28Civ5%29](city) near the poles, make sure that none of the surrounding Ice restricts your access to nearby naval [Resources%20%28Civ5%29](resources). Also, keep in mind that if a water tile your city is built next to is completely surrounded by Ice, you shouldn't build any naval units there, since they will never be able to reach the open seas.
Note that Ice is treated like a special kind of water tile, so cities built next to Ice count as coastal for the purposes of constructing [Building%20%28Civ5%29](buildings) like [Harbor%20%28Civ5%29](Harbors) and [Lighthouse%20%28Civ5%29](Lighthouses).
