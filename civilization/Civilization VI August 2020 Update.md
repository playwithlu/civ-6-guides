# Civilization VI August 2020 Update

The August 2020 Update for "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)" was released on August 27th, 2020. The following is a complete list of change notes.
New features.
Tech and Civic Shuffle Mode.
This new game mode adds variety to the tech tree, as it shuffles techs and civics within their historical eras, leading to different costs and prerequisites than normal. The resulting trees are the same for all players. Techs and civics are also hidden until a prerequisite is earned, preserving the mystery of discovery all the way until the end of the game.
Natural Wonder Picker.
Sick of the [Bermuda%20Triangle%20%28Civ6%29](Bermuda Triangle)? Want to break the [Delicate%20Arch%20%28Civ6%29](Delicate Arch)? In Advanced Setup, you can now bring up a new menu to choose which Natural Wonders you would like to include in your next game. Wonders checked are not guaranteed to be in your next game, rather, they are part of the pool of Wonders that will then be randomly selected and placed.
Balance/Polish.
Note: Items in the list below apply to the [Gathering%20Storm%20%28Civ6%29](Gathering Storm) ruleset only.
