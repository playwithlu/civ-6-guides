Game Info.
Siege unit of the [Medieval%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Medieval Era). Upgrades from the [Catapult%20%28Civ5%29](Catapult).
Strategy.
A Trebuchet is a medieval siege weapon, significantly more powerful than the earlier Catapult. Advances in technology allow a much more efficient launch system, capable of delivering larger, more powerful projectiles that can more easily punch through [Walls%20%28Civ5%29](Walls) and other defenses medieval [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities) use. Still, the Trebuchet must expend 1 {{Movement5}} to set up, is too bulky to use natural defenses, and has limited vision. Always support your Trebuchets with melee and ranged [Unit%20%28Civ5%29](units) to keep enemy units from getting too close.
Another popular use for Trebuchets is defending your own cities, as they can do a lot of damage to [Longswordsman%20%28Civ5%29](Longswordsmen). If on friendly [Road%20%28Civ5%29](roads), they expend a non-integer amount of {{Movement5}}, and hence can use their {{Movement5}} to set up and attack on the same turn.
