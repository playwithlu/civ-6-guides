# Galley (Civ6)

The Galley is an [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Naval%20melee](naval melee unit) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
The Galley is the first [Naval%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](naval unit) available in the game. As could be expected, its combat capabilities are quite limited, but it is relatively cheap to produce and can still be used to explore and conquer [Coastal%20%28Civ6%29](coastal) [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities), or harass the enemy by [Combat%20%28Civ6%29%23Pillaging](pillaging) coastal [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](improvements).
Combat using a Galley can be extremely unpredictable. Due to their weak nature, most fights they enter will likely result in either a stalemate or their defeat.
[Barbarian%20%28Civ6%29](Barbarian) Galleys will sometimes appear alongside [Quadrireme%20%28Civ6%29](Quadriremes). Maritime [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) should proceed to [Shipbuilding%20%28Civ6%29](Shipbuilding) and [Exploration%20%28Civ6%29](Exploration) as soon as possible so as to upgrade to superior naval units!
