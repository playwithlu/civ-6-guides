Strategy.
Limes is very useful for speeding up the erection of [Walls%20%28Civ6%29](Walls) around your [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities). Given the level of aggression of the [AI](AI), especially on higher [Difficulty%20level%20%28Civ6%29](difficulties), you will need at least [Ancient%20Walls%20%28Civ6%29](Ancient Walls), and maybe not only in your border cities. 100% bonus means it will take exactly half the usual time to build defenses, so use the opportunity to build these in as many cities as you can.
This policy is especially useful if you go with [Monarchy%20%28Civ6%29](Monarchy) as your [Government%20%28Civ6%29](government), because of the additional 50% bonus to construction speed and bonus that Walls confer to cities at a time when they're usually either close to or at their limit. [Georgian%20%28Civ6%29](Georgian) players can quickly build city walls and the [Tsikhe%20%28Civ6%29](Tsikhe) throughout their empire with this policy.
Limes also slightly aids a player going for a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Cultural Victory), since the Walls it helps them build will provide them with once [Conservation%20%28Civ6%29](Conservation) has been discovered.
