# Heavy Chariot (Civ6)

The Heavy Chariot is an [Ancient%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Ancient Era) [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Heavy%20cavalry](heavy cavalry unit) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
The lumbering Heavy Chariot may look unwieldy, but the poor soldiers crushed under its wheels don't seem to think so. Not only is the chariot the strongest land-based melee unit in the Ancient Era, but it also may move farther than any other unit on open terrain, and it doesn't require any [Resource%20%28Civ6%29](resources)!
The Heavy Chariot is in fact a proto-cavalry, unlike the [Chariot%20Archer%20%28Civ5%29](Chariot Archer) in "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)" (which was a ranged unit). But even when used as a regular melee unit it will crush its opponents, thanks to its superior Combat Strength. Its only nemesis is the [Spearman%20%28Civ6%29](Spearman), which has a special bonus versus cavalry, bringing its total Combat Strength to 35 against the chariot! So, stay away from any army with lines of Spearmen.
