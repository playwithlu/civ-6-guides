# Furs (Civ5)

Game Info.
Luxury resource.
Strategy.
 Furs are found mainly in the polar regions of the world, most of the time in [Forest%20%28Civ5%29](Forests), or rarely on bare [Tundra%20%28Civ5%29](Tundra) tiles. They're accessed via [Camp%20%28Civ5%29](Camps), which makes it possible to preserve the original Forest and use its additional output.
 Furs are important source of additional in these regions where there are few other resources; [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilizations) which start there should seek them out and claim them early.
