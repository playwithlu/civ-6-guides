# Sepats (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Civilizations that wound along the Nile’s path could not easily govern every section of their territory from a central location. The Nile peoples solved this with sepats, or “nomes,” as the Greek-speaking Ptolemaics later called them. These administrative districts were responsible for each segment of the Nile or portion of the Nile Delta.
