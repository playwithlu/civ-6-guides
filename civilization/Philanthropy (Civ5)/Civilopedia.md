# Philanthropy (Civ5)/Civilopedia

Philanthropy is the policy where a nation's wealthiest citizens give some portion of their wealth back to the people, often in the form of libraries, museums, hospitals or scholarships. Unlike patronage, where the citizen is paying for the creation of art for himself and others of his class, philanthropy tends to benefit the poorer members of society. Scottish-American Andrew Carnegie was one of the great philanthropists in history. For much of his life Carnegie was an utterly ruthless businessman, creating the US Steel company and making the second largest fortune in history, largely on the backs of the men who slaved in his mines and foundries. Upon selling his business in 1901, Carnegie devoted the last 19 years of his life to building libraries in poor cities, providing funding to some 3,000 in the US, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and other countries around the world.
