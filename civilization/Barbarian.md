# Barbarian

Barbarians are a [Non-player%20character](non-playable) "[Civilizations](civilization)" that cannot win but instead go on rampages trying to destroy other civilizations. They can even capture unguarded [City](cities). Barbarians may offer early advantages to players who defeat their villages.
In some games, unhappy cities can spawn rebels, which are similar to barbarians.
