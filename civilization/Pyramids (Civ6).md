# Pyramids (Civ6)

The Pyramids are an in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". They must be built on [Desert%20%28Civ6%29](Desert) or [Desert%20Floodplains%20%28Civ6%29](Desert Floodplains).
Strategy.
The Pyramids are one of the best early wonders in the game. An additional charge for [Builder%20%28Civ6%29](Builders) this early on is somewhat of a game-changer, as it increases a single [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](unit's) effectiveness by 33% - you can do more while spending less ! The extra Builder unit is also handy, as it makes up for the lost time dedicated to building the wonder. Of course, you need a Desert [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tile) to construct it.
The Pyramids have good synergy with the [Serfdom%20%28Civ6%29](Serfdom) [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](policy card), which provides newly trained Builders with 2 additional charges. By combining this wonder with this card, it is possible to have Builders with twice the standard number of charges. [Qin%20Shi%20Huang%20%28Civ6%29](Qin Shi Huang) enjoys even greater benefits from this combo, which will provide his Builders with an unparalleled 7 charges. In the expansions, a [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) in which [Liang%20%28Surveyor%29%20%28Civ6%29](Liang) is established can produce Builders with 8 charges when playing as Qin Shi Huang and 7 charges when playing as any other [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) and [Leaders%20%28Civ6%29](leader).
The Pyramids can also be useful when playing as [Montezuma%20%28Civ6%29](Montezuma's) [Aztec%20%28Civ6%29](Aztecs). After declaring war with your [Eagle%20Warrior%20%28Civ6%29](Eagle Warriors) and successfully capturing a city full of [Resource%20%28Civ6%29%23Luxury](luxury resources), your Builders can repair or build the [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](tile improvements) that give you access to them. A successful battle will make your people happy while bringing you closer to winning a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Domination](Domination Victory).
