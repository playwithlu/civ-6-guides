# Rocketry (Civ6)

Rocketry is an [Atomic%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Atomic Era) [Technology%20%28Civ6%29](technology) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)."
Strategy.
Rockets are the future. For civilian scientists, they are the way to the stars, for the military - the way to victory. It took a good time to develop rocketry, but once they were perfected, around WW2, they revealed a whole new horizon for mankind. It turned out rockets have both civilian and military use. The second one is pretty straightforward - relatively small rockets are the next generation, 'smart' weapon to substitute the 'dumb' bombs that, once launched from the tube (or released from the hold of the bomber), will fly according to the laws of ballistics. Now, the rocket can change direction mid-flight...
The first use of rockets is to conquer earth's gravity pool. And for this, you will need a whole new in your cities - the [Spaceport%20%28Civ6%29](Spaceport). A second, more sinister rocket-launching platform, the [Missile%20Silo%20%28Civ6%29](Missile Silo), becomes available to takes care of rockets which kill.
All of this is so complex that you can only boost it through [Espionage%20%28Civ6%29](Espionage), or through the insight of certain [Great%20Scientist%20%28Civ6%29](Great Scientists).
Also, all this complicated research into excavating earth for those Missile Silos results in more productive and efficient drilling/excavating procedures for your Quarries
Oh, and now you can start your conquest of space by launching your first satellite. (As someone said, space is the final frontier...)
