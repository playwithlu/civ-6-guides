# Naval unit (CivRev)

A naval unit, as its name implies, is a [List%20of%20units%20in%20CivRev](unit) that fights on the water. They are the most numerous type of unit after [Ground%20unit%20%28CivRev%29](ground units).
All naval units can only move over water, and most can traverse both shallow and deep [Sea%20%28CivRev%29](seas) (except [Galley%20%28CivRev%29](Galleys), which can only traverse shallow seas). All naval units other than [Submarine%20%28CivRev%29](Submarines) can carry ground units as passengers, and can transport them to islands or other continents.
Naval units can defend against [Air%20unit%20%28CivRev%29](air units), but cannot attack them. [Army%20%28CivRev%29](Armies) of naval units are referred to as "Fleets."
