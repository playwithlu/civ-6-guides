# Movement (Civ4)

In "[Civilization%20IV](Civilization IV)", much of your time is spent moving your around on the - you send them out to [Exploration%20%28Civ4%29](Explore) new territory; you march them off to battle; and so forth. The basic rules of movement are simple; each unit in the game has a certain number of "movement points" (MPs) which they can expend each turn. Units spend MPs entering a new square; some terrain is more difficult to move through (and thus costs more MPs to enter), some less so, and some is impassable. Certain cut down the cost of entering certain spaces.
There are three basic unit types in the game: land, sea, and air units.
Land Movement.
Land units may move only onto land . They may not move onto water (unless carried aboard a sea transport unit). Further, land units may not enter spaces.
"Note: A unit can always enter a space if it has any MPs left. Thus, a 1 MP unit could enter a forest space, but its move would end there. (See for details.)"
Water Movement.
Water units can enter only ocean, coastal, and coastal city squares. They cannot move onto land spaces. Water units cannot enter ice spaces.
Air Units.
In general, air units can enter both land and water spaces, including impassable ice and peak spaces. All spaces cost 1 MP for air units to enter. See for more details.
Promotions.
Certain allow units to move faster through certain terrain types or grant them extra MPs altogether. For example, the Mobility promotion allows mounted and armored units to move faster through rough terrain and the Navigation promotions grant water units extra MPs.
Effects of Borders on Movement.
Your units can move freely within your territory and unclaimed territory, as well as through territory of civilizations with whom you have an treaty. If you enter territory of a civilization without such a treaty, you declare war on that civ. You do not get the benefits of roads or rails when moving into enemy territory.
Effects of Other Units on Movement.
Other friendly or neutral units do not affect your units' movement at all; in other words, your units can move onto the same space as a foreign unit without attacking it. However, if your unit enters a space containing an enemy unit, your unit will initiate with the enemy.
Controlling Your Units.
You can use your mouse or keyboard to move your units. See the game controls section of the manual to learn how to "activate" units and tell them where you want them to go.
