# River (CivRev)

Rivers are a [Terrain%20%28CivRev%29](terrain) feature in "[Civilization%20Revolution](Civilization Revolution)".
A [List%20of%20units%20in%20CivRev](unit) attacking over a river receives a 50% penalty to attack, while the defender receives a 50% bonus to [Defense%20%28CivRev%29](defense). Putting [City%20%28CivRev%29](cities) next to rivers and on a [Hill%20%28CivRev%29](hill) can make it extremely difficult for enemy ground forces to capture them.
Rivers add +1 food to adjacent [Grassland%20%28CivRev%29](Grassland) and [Plains%20%28CivRev%29](Plains) terrain tiles once [Irrigation%20%28CivRev%29](Irrigation) is discovered, and [Sea%20%28CivRev%29](Sea) terrain tiles once a [Harbor%20%28CivRev%29](Harbor) is constructed.
