# Robin Hood (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Robin Hood, or Robin of Locksley, was a legendary outlaw lord who resisted the efforts of 
Prince John Plantagenet to usurp the throne of his brother Richard (the Lionheart). Robin Hood 
shows up throughout English literature, and plays a significant part in Sir Walter Scott's famous 
novel "Ivanhoe". The origin of the Robin Hood legend is in 14th century ballads and poems from 
Yorkshire (not Nottingham!), and Robin Hood is depicted as a noble outlaw who treats commoners 
with dignity, and who targets not just the corrupt Sheriff but evil bishops, monks, and secular 
authorities.
