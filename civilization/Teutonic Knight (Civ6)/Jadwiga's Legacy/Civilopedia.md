# Teutonic Knight (Civ6)/Jadwiga's Legacy/Civilopedia

Bandits take many forms—some ambush unwary travelers on the roads, others raid undefended villages. The very worst clad themselves in steel and claim their depredations are in God's name.
The Teutonic Knights are such men. When a Polish king hired their "knightly order" to liberate Gdańsk, they did so—and then liberated the loyal Polish populace from their lives. They crusade against Lithuania, a newly Christian nation. The only article of faith they hold is coin.
They claim to act for God? Then let us send them to God, where they can justify their claims in person.
