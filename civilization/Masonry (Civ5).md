# Masonry (Civ5)

Game Info.
Masonry is the art of building massive stone structures, and working with stone in general. It allows you to build {{Link5|Walls}}, which greatly improve the defense of {{Link5|cities}}. Also allows {{Link5|Worker}}s to construct [Quarry%20%28Civ5%29](Quarries) to gain access to [Stone%20%28Civ5%29](Stone) and [Marble%20%28Civ5%29](Marble) resources, and clear [Marsh%20%28Civ5%29](marshes), allowing other {{Link5|improvement}}s to be constructed on that tile.
