# Dias' Voyage (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Prior to Columbus' discovery of America in 1492, the greatest voyage undertaken during the
early period of European exploration was Bartolomeu Dias' discovery of the Cape of Good
Hope in 1488. This Portuguese explorer's discovery of the southernmost extent of Africa 
made Europe aware of the Indian Ocean and a potential route to India. Dias would accompany Vasco da Gama for a portion of the first voyage to India in 1497. He also traveled across 
the western Atlantic to Brazil; on that voyage he was lost at sea in 1500.
