# Gold (currency) (Civ6)

 Gold is one of the main statistics in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is used as the main standardized currency not only of your empire, but also in the entire game world. It is needed for maintaining infrastructure and armies, for trading with other [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations), and more.
Mechanics.
 Gold is gathered and spent empire-wide, like and . But unlike them, unspent Gold can be accumulated in the player's treasury once automatic expenses are deducted from income. The amount of Gold in the treasury is always visible in the upper left corner of the UI.
Right next to the treasury you can see your Gold flow — the current difference between expenses and income in your empire — which is added to or subtracted from the treasury at the beginning of each turn. Unlike other stats, you can have positive or negative Gold flow, and the latter can severely hamper your development. Note that your Gold flow may sometimes change between turns (for example, due to the beginning of a [Diplomacy%20%28Civ6%29](diplomatic) deal, or a switch in [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](policies)), so the number you see at the end of each turn may not always match the actual change in your treasury.
Uses.
The uses of Gold are many and diverse. Although Gold is not essential for the basic development of your civilization or its [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) (this is reserved for other stats, such as and ), it is still absolutely necessary. Since it is the standard currency in the game, it is used to pay for all regular expenses of your empire. The amount of Gold necessary to cover your maintenance costs and any other expenditures is automatically deducted from your treasury at the beginning of each turn. The Gold that is left can be spent on special activities, such as trading with other [Leaders%20%28Civ6%29](leaders) or making purchases.
Maintenance.
 Gold is required to pay the upkeep, or maintenance cost, of almost every [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](unit) and [Building%20%28Civ6%29](building) in the game, as well as all specialty s (except for the [Commercial%20Hub%20%28Civ6%29](Commercial Hub) and the [Harbor%20%28Civ6%29](Harbor), which pay for their own upkeep with the Gold they produce). While unit maintenance costs are initially small (around 1-3 Gold), they usually scale with the game [Era%20%28Civ6%29](era) and can become quite large late in the game. A [Spearman%20%28Civ6%29](Spearman) from the [Ancient%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Ancient Era), for example, has a maintenance cost of 1 Gold, whereas a [Giant%20Death%20Robot%20%28Civ6%29](Giant Death Robot) from the [Information%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Information Era) has a maintenance cost of 15 Gold. Building and district maintenance costs are fixed. Note that the very first units in the game, the [Warrior%20%28Civ6%29](Warrior), the [Slinger%20%28Civ6%29](Slinger), and the [Scout%20%28Civ6%29](Scout) (as well as the [War-Cart%20%28Civ6%29](War-Cart) when playing as [Sumerian%20%28Civ6%29](Sumeria)) are so simply outfitted that they need no maintenance.
There is no way to avoid paying maintenance costs, but one may attempt to diminish them with the following policies:
In-city spending.
 Gold may be used as a currency for making purchases in a city as follows:
1 Gold is equivalent to 0.25 or 0.5 .
There are ways to reduce the above costs, both by policies and by certain [Government%20%28Civ6%29](governments).
Diplomatic deals.
 Gold is often used as a part of deals with the leaders of other civilizations. You may trade both bulk amounts of Gold (which are deducted only at the time of the deal) or gold-per-turn (GPT) with another civilization, which will effectively alter your Gold flow for the duration of the deal.
Other uses.
 Gold may be used to attract via [Great%20People%20%28Civ6%29%23Attracting%20via%20Patronage](patronage). This is especially useful for empires that developed their Gold capabilities while neglecting other aspects of the game, and can't manage to produce enough GPPs to beat the competition.
The [Suzerain%20%28Civ6%29](Suzerain) of a [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-state) may spend Gold to take control of the city-state's military. Note that the military will remain under their control for up to 30 turns.
Sources.
 Gold sources are numerous, but which ones you are able to use varies greatly in the different parts of the game.
Terrain and resources.
These will be your main sources of Gold at the beginning of the game. Gold from [Terrain%20%28Civ6%29](terrain) is not as scarce as in ', yet not as abundant as '. [Coast%20%28Civ6%29](Coastal) tiles and the [Oasis%20%28Civ6%29](Oasis) feature both grant a base yield of +1 Gold for being worked.
Apart from this, bonus Gold yield is provided by numerous [Resource%20%28Civ6%29%23Luxury](Luxury Resources), as well as some [Resource%20%28Civ6%29%23Bonus](Bonus Resources):
Tile improvements.
A few [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](tile improvements) grant bonus Gold yields. The most important of these are the [Camp%20%28Civ6%29](Camp) (+1 Gold; +1 Gold with ) and the [Plantation%20%28Civ6%29](Plantation) (+2 Gold; +1 Gold with ). Both of these provide their initial bonus Gold from the very start of the game, which makes them important sources for a nascent empire.
The following improvements also yield Gold after sufficient technological development:
Late in the game, the [Seaside%20Resort%20%28Civ6%29](Seaside Resort) may turn into a major Gold source. Each one nets Gold equal to its [Appeal%20%28Civ6%29](Appeal) rating, and since Seaside Resorts may only be constructed on tiles with an Appeal of 4 or greater, they are capable of outproducing any other single tile in your territory (excluding some improved Luxury Resources).
Trading and Trade Routes.
One of the major ways to obtain Gold is via s, which become available soon after the start of the game, after researching [Foreign%20Trade%20%28Civ6%29](Foreign Trade). s to international destinations (both other civilizations and [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-states)) will garner large amounts of Gold income, especially later in the game when you've established s and extended the range of your routes. Note that making routes to city-states of which you're the Suzerain won't net additional income! Domestic s may also provide Gold with certain policies.
You can also get substantial income from making trading deals with other civilizations. There are many things you may trade to the other leaders, getting either GPT or single large payments of Gold in return.
The problem is that bad diplomatic relations severely hamper trading deals, up to the point of making them impossible! A civilization striving for a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Domination](Domination Victory), for example, will find it significantly more difficult to strike deals due to the [Warmongering%20%28Civ6%29](warmongering) penalties it has incurred. Not only that, but it will have to be very careful where it sends its [Trader%20%28Civ6%29](Traders) - other civilizations which are at war with it will plunder the s, severely limiting this income possibility.
Districts and buildings.
In the middle game your main source of Gold will switch towards its dedicated district: the Commercial Hub. Its adjacency bonuses grant extra Gold and are fairly easy to activate (due to the prevalence of River and Sea settlements). Its buildings, the , the , and the , also provide massive boosts (+3, +5, and +7 Gold respectively), and its [Specialists%20%28Civ6%29](Specialists) grant +4 Gold each!
Trade city-states grant up to +8 Gold in every Commercial Hub district in your empire (and in "Gathering Storm", in every Harbor) based on the number of s assigned to that particular city-state. The gets an additional +4 Gold per city-state.
Although the Commercial Hub district is the main source of district Gold income, the Harbor district creates substantial Gold income as well. Its Specialists grant +2 Gold each, it generates Gold adjacency bonuses, and its and grant +1 and +2 Gold respectively.
The of a civilization's , located in the City Center, also grants +5 Gold.
Wonders.
Several [Wonder%20%28Civ6%29](Wonders) grant bonus Gold upon completion, including:
 Gold can also be obtained from [Natural%20wonder%20%28Civ6%29](natural wonders):
Policy cards.
Many policy cards grant bonus Gold once their conditions are met. These include:
Other sources.
Clearing [Barbarian%20%28Civ6%29%23Outposts](barbarian outposts) earns your civilization a Gold reward, which varies with the [Difficulty%20level%20%28Civ6%29](difficulty level) of the game.
A few s provide Gold:
Finally, Gold may be procured via three distinct [Religion%20%28Civ6%29%23Founder%20Beliefs%20%28Group%201%29](founder beliefs):
Unique bonuses.
Many unique pieces of infrastructure and [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](civ/leader abilities) grant special Gold bonuses. Below is a non-exhaustive list:
