# List of advances in Civ2

The following is a list of advances in "[Civilization%20II](Civilization II)" and its expansions.
The programming shows Plumbing could be activated as an early researchable advance; however, it adds nothing to the gameplay. In addition, there is a listing for 'Future Technology'. It is possible to research all of the advances by the later stages of a highly advanced game, and at that point additional 'Future Technologies' are learned in succession (Future Tech 1, Future Tech 2, Future Tech 3, etc.). Researching these additional 'Future Technologies' can increase the final score at the end of the game.
Lastly, the file includes at the end of the list an extra 10 Technology 'slots' that are not tied to anything (activated). This allows some level of customization (see [Civilization%20II%23Game%20Modification](Game Modification) section), because you can insert them at various points and then use them as prerequisites for units or buildings, or to render units and wonders as obsolete.
