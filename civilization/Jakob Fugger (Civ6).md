Strategy.
Jakob Fugger is one of the less impactful Great Merchants. While both of his bonuses provide useful things, his ability pales in comparison to those of [Giovanni%20de%27%20Medici%20%28Civ6%29](Giovanni de' Medici) and [Raja%20Todar%20Mal%20%28Civ6%29](Raja Todar Mal), both of whom are available in the same [Era%20%28Civ6%29](era) as Fugger. A lump sum of can be used strategically to upgrade [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](units) for a timing push, but 2 s hardly change anything in the [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-state) diplomatic game, so the is much more valuable most of the time. In the [Monopolies%20and%20Corporations%20%28Civ6%29](Monopolies and Corporations) [Game%20mode%20%28Civ6%29](game mode), you should consider picking and saving Fugger to establish a [Corporation%20%28Civ6%29](Corporation), especially when the Great Merchants you want are gone. Otherwise, save your points for one of the aforementioned ones, both of whom are far superior to Fugger.
