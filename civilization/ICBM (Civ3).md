# ICBM (Civ3)

An ICBM (inter-continental ballistic missile) has an unlimited range, and like the tactical nuke, has a devastating effect. They cannot be moved from the city that builds them but can strike any target on the map. Nuclear weapons, if used, have a tremendous negative effect upon world opinion.
A city must have aluminum and uranium in its Strategic Resource box to build ICBMs.
