# Numidian Cavalry (Civ4)

The Numidian Cavalry is the [Unique%20unit%20%28Civ4%29](unique unit) of the [Carthaginian%20%28Civ4%29](Carthaginian) [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ4](civilization).
Strategy.
Compared to the [Horse%20Archer%20%28Civ4%29](Horse Archer) that it replaces, Numidian Cavalry has one less strength point, but a 50% bonus against [Melee%20unit%20%28Civ4%29](melee units) and the [Flanking%20%28Civ4%29](Flanking I) [Promotions%20%28Civ4%29](promotion).
Numidian Cavalry lack the usual weakness to [Spearman%20%28Civ4%29](Spearmen), having a much smaller difference in strength. (Spearmen will still have a minor advantage, but not much.) Like most mounted units, it lacks defensive bonuses, and it has a higher-than-normal retreat chance, so it's better to attack the Spearmen rather than defending against them in many cases.
With bonuses against both Melee and Catapults, Numidian Cavalry can take out many threats on the field, but will be vulnerable to other mounted units.
