# Cryptography (Civ6)

Cryptography is a Diplomatic [Policy%20Cards%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
Cryptography serves dual purposes: it protects your [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) from enemy [Spy%20%28Civ6%29](Spies) and enables your Spies to carry out offensive [Espionage%20%28Civ6%29%23Espionage%20Missions](missions) more successfully. It's a good go-to policy in the late game, especially if you have a substantial scientific, cultural, or economic advantage over your opponents and they're trying to use their Spies to close the gap.
