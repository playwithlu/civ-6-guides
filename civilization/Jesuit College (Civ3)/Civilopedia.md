# Jesuit College (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Founded in 1540 by Ignatius Loyola, in part as a reaction to the Protestant Reformation, the Jesuit Order was created to help reform the Catholic Church and spread its teachings world-wide.
A Jesuit network of colleges and universities soon sprang up around Europe, giving them the nickname of "schoolmasters of Europe". Their work also spread to the New World, where Jesuit
missionaries worked to bring Christianity to the indigenous people of the Americas.
