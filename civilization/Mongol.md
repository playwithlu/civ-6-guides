# Mongol

The Mongol people, also known as the Mongolians, represent Mongolia, a [Civilizations](civilization) in the "[Civilization%20%28series%29](Civilization)" and "[Call%20to%20Power%20games](Call to Power)" games and "[C-evo](C-evo)". Their [capital](capital) might be [Karakorum](Karakorum), [Samarkand](Samarkand), or [Xanadu](Xanadu), and they can be led by [Bortei](Bortei), [Genghis%20Khan](Genghis Khan), or [Kublai%20Khan](Kublai Khan).
Mongol hordes (notably under Genghis Khan) ravaged [Europe](Europe) from bases in central [Asia](Asia). They eventually got beaten back to the eastern extremity of their former [territory](territory), a smallish area north of [Chinese](China), which got the name "Mongolia" applied by [English](English) explorers and/or mapmakers and has now stuck.
Whereas "[Sid%20Meier%27s%20Civilization](Sid Meier's Civilization)", "[Civilization%20II](Civilization II)", "[Civilization%20III](Civilization III)", "[C-evo](C-evo)", and "[Freeciv](Freeciv)" refer to the people of this civilization as Mongols, "[Civilization%20IV](Civilization IV)" and subsequent games refer to them as Mongolians instead, which makes sense if there are nations such as Uzbeks, Kazakhs, Tajiks, and [Georgian](Georgian)s in the game occupying what used to be Mongol territory in the broad sense. Both are gathered on this page for simplicity.
