# Jungle (Civ5)/Civilopedia

Dark, forbidding, and deadly to the uninitiated, jungles are a rich source of food to those with the skill and knowledge to live within them. However, jungles do not provide much in the way of materials, and a growing civilization may be tempted to mine them or turn them into cropland. However, military units situated in jungles receive a significant defensive bonus.
