Strategy.
The Norwegian Ski Infantry, as their name suggests, are masters when fighting in snow, tundra, or hills. They not only receive a combat bonus there, but also move at double speed, which makes the Danes the absolute masters of the far north and south! The combat bonus even stacks up to a 50% combat bonus in tundra hills or snow hills. Use the combat bonus in hills to negate the attempts of enemy ranged units to occupy vantage points, and occupy them yourself!
