# Radar Artillery (Civ3)

Radar Artillery are highly advanced stand-off attack units. The radar allow them to see up to two squares distant,
regardless of blocking terrain, and fire that far as well. Radar Artillery has no attack or defense value, so it should be protected by an escort.
A city must have aluminum in its Strategic Resource box to build radar artillery.
