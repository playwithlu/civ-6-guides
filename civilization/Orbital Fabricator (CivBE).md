# Orbital Fabricator (CivBE)

Strategy.
The Orbital Fabricator is a marvel of space engineering, a production platform based in space which uses fully automated manufacturing lines and ships products to the ground below. Not only that, but its phasing rays create seismic waves in the ground below and are capable of revealing new Strategic resources there!
Use this satellite to improve vastly production in your cities. Make sure to deploy it above terrain which doesn't have many useful resources in order to use its power to create Strategic resources!
Orbital Fabricators only produce resources on unimproved tiles. Farms and mines and other resources count as improvements, however roads, mag rails, units, forests and miasma do not.
If you have the production available is often more profitable to deorbit and replace your Orbital Fabricator immediately after its first resource is created. This leads to more resources created over time.
Extended orbital unit bonuses such as the [Slavic%20Federation%20%28CivBE%29](Slav's) passive (20% extra orbital time) and the Superior Engineering Industry virtue do not affect the number of resources generated or the rate at which they are generated by the Orbital Fabricator. Even with the bonuses, the satellite will only make 1-2 resources within its first 60 turns of existence. After 60 turns it will not create any resources. This makes those bonuses useless when you're trying to maximize the number of resources generated.
