Historically the Diplomat has often doubled as both peaceful emissary and meddlesome reporter. However, the role hasn't always been as formalized as it is today. Before modern times, private merchants often filled the role of the diplomat. Even through the 20th century and the demise of the nation-state, friendship or nepotism played a significant role in diplomacy. For instance, American diplomats were often selected for their contributions to the president rather than for their ability to conduct effective negotiations.
