Upon researching [Mobile%20Warfare%20%28Civ2%29](Mobile Warfare), it will be obsoleted by the development of [Armor%20%28Civ2%29](Armor).
Civilopedia entry.
Cavalry are mounted soldiers trained to fight on horseback. Because of their speed, cavalry units were often used for reconnaissance missions and hit-and-run raids on enemy installations and troops. Although warriors fighting from horseback with a variety of weapons dates back to ancient Egypt, horse-mounted cavalry as we generally think of it today actually began in the late 1700's. Under Napoleon, the cavalry became an elite force, frequently deployed simultaneously with foot soldiers, to mask the movements of the main battle force. Cavalry were used extensively in the American Civil War, and in other conflicts throughout the mid to late 19th century. When the repeating rifle replaced earlier single-shot firearms, horse-mounted troops became easy targets for infantrymen. The South African War, from 1899 to 1902, was the last major conflict where cavalry played a major role. Today, the roles once performed by horse-mounted cavalry have been assumed by troops utilizing armored assault vehicles and aircraft.
