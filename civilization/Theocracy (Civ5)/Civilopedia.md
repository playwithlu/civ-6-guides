# Theocracy (Civ5)/Civilopedia

In a theocratic state, the religious leaders hold ultimate power in the country. Actually, the religion's god is in power, and he or she rules through divine guidance of the religious leaders. Theocracies are often militaristic, as the religious leaders see the country's army as a tool to spread the religion to other heathen states. Modern theocracies seem to often fear and hate progress, seeing modern luxuries and advancements as threats to the nation's piety (and perhaps to their power).
