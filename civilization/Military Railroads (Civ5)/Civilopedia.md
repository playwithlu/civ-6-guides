# Military Railroads (Civ5)/Civilopedia

The United States Military Railroad was established by the U.S. War Department in 1862 to operate any rail lines seized by the federal government after Congress authorized Lincoln to commandeer railroads and telegraph lines for use by the military. By war's end, the USMRR controlled over 2000 miles of Northern track and captured Southern rail lines.
