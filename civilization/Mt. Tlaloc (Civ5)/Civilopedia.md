# Mt. Tlaloc (Civ5)/Civilopedia

Standing over 13,600 feet in central Mexico, Mount Tlaloc was revered by the Aztecs, who worshiped their rain god at a sanctuary on the summit. Archaeological research has shown a relationship between this shrine and surrounding temples may have been a way to track important ceremonial dates, associated with the sowing of maize in the region.
