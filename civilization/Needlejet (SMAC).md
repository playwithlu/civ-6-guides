# Needlejet (SMAC)

Game info.
Needlejets, the signature aircraft of the 23rd century, appear in Planet's skies once Planet's growing industries begin producing high grade jet fuel in sufficient quantities. Powerful, but limited in range, Needlejets can be used to defend the skies, project air power, and explore Planet. Needlejets must return to a friendly base or airbase every other turn for refueling.
