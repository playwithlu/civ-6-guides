# Artillery (Civ5)/Civilopedia

As technology has advanced, artillery has assumed ever greater importance on the battlefield. The 19th century guns of the Napoleonic and American Civil Wars are gone, having been replaced by ever-larger, more accurate and deadlier weapons as the years have passed. The German 88Â mm gun is one of the best and most versatile artillery weapons of the Second World War. Originally designed as an anti-aircraft weapon, the gun proved so successful as an anti-tank weapon that variants were created for just that purpose.
