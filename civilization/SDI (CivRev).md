Civilopedia entry.
The SDI "Strategic Defense Initiative" is a defensive system that attempts to protect a country from intercontinental nuclear missiles. The system relies on satellites and ground-based radar to provide warning of incoming missiles, which it then shoots down with anti-missile missiles. The United States of America is currently working on an SDI system, although missile-interception is providing to be extremely difficult, and many scientists, engineers and politicians doubt that the final product will be worth the effort.
