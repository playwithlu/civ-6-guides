# Palace of the Inca (Civ3)/Civilopedia

On a small island in Lake Titicaca (called the Island of the Sun) sits the Palace of the Inca. This small 52 foot by 46 foot structure is believed to mark the birthplace of the first Incas. In its day, the palace contained fabulous wealth, and it's likely that the Incan king (the Sapa-Inca) made an annual pilgramage to it to worship and give thanks to the sun for creating his children... the Inca.
