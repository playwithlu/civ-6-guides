# Airport (Civ6)

The Airport is an advanced aerial [Building%20%28Civ6%29](building) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is built in the [Aerodrome%20%28Civ6%29](Aerodrome) [District%20%28Civ6%29](district) and requires a [Hangar%20%28Civ6%29](Hangar) (or one of its replacements).
Strategy.
For those that manage to quickly develop the requisite [Civic%20%28Civ6%29](civic), the Airport allows terrific mobility! Just as in "", you will now be able to instantly move [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](units) between [Continent%20%28Civ6%29](continents), literally from one part of the world to the other! Of course, you will need to develop your Aerodromes at the two points first.
And of course, the Airport allows further enhancement of the city's {{Production6}} capabilities and [Air%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](airplane) construction efficiency.
Keep in mind, all tiles adjacent to the Aerodrome and the [City%20Center%20%28Civ6%29](City Center) gain the ability to airlift after building the Airport. It can be useful to maximize the number of tiles able to airlift units.
