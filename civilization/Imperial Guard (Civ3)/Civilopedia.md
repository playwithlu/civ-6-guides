# Imperial Guard (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Every army during the Napoleonic Era had its elite forces. For the French,
the Imperial Guard were the pride of the battlefield. Credited with winning
many battles, French elite infantry -- the "Old Guard", "Middle Guard" and
"Young Guard" -- was comprised of seasoned veterans that could be relied upon to
carry the day.
