Gameplay.
Mass Production represents an explosion in the productive power of {{LinkCTP2|Factories}} to generate finished goods. The Advance makes the {{LinkCTP2|PT Boat}} and the {{LinkCTP2|Destroyer}} available. Players can redirect {{LinkCTP2|Production}} into {{LinkCTP2|Public Works}} with infrastructure. The {{LinkCTP2|Sonar Buoy}} is a strong defensive weapon in naval combat.
Great Library entry.
The Industrial Revolution ushered in the age of factory-driven production, with huge machines increase automation and virtually eliminating the need for highly skilled artisans and craftsmen. Factory systems continued to evolve throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, and, in 1913, a moving conveyor belt installed in an automobile plant in Dearborn, Michigan became the first instance of modern mass production techniques in use. One of the progenitors of mass production was industrialist and inventor Henry Ford. He and his colleagues examined the historical benefits of dividing the manufacturing process into sequences of individual tasks, each performed by a specially trained worker. Ford further refined his conveyor belt operations by employing the time and motion studies pioneered by F.W. Taylor and Lillian B. Gilbreth in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
Mass production techniques took the manufacturing world by storm. Specialization, division of labor and standardization of parts lowered the cost, improved the quality and increased the quantity of finished goods. These changes particularly affected large-scale manufacturing operations, such as automobile, ship and airplane building.
