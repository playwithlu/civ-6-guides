# Knights (CivRev)

The Knights are a mounted unit in "[Civilization%20Revolution](Civilization Revolution)".
Unit Analysis.
Like most other combat units, Knights can attack and defend against enemies. Whether fighting other [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20CivRev](civilizations) or just some feeble [Barbarian%20%28CivRev%29](barbarians), Knights are powerful, highly mobile units. The trusty steeds they are mounted on really give them that extra punch in battle. Their only weakness is their [Defense%20%28CivRev%29](defense), which is relatively poor. Three units can be combined to create an [Army%20%28CivRev%29](Army) of Knights, which is the most powerful mobile attack force in the [Medieval%20Era%20%28CivRev%29](Medieval Era).
Knights upgrade to [Tank%20%28CivRev%29](Tanks) if [Combustion%20%28CivRev%29](Combustion) is discovered before [Leonardo%27s%20Workshop%20%28CivRev%29](Leonardo's Workshop) is finished building.
