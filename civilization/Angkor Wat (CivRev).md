Civilopedia entry.
Angkor Wat stands as the culmination of the Khmer civilization and one of the greatest feats of religious and political architecture ever built. Located in modern Cambodia, this massive temple to the Hindu god Vishnu was constructed by Suryavarman II in the first half of the twelfth century. The walls of Angkor Wat are artistic masterpieces, bearing thousands of bas-reliefs of gods, myths and kings. So grand are the palace and the surrounding grounds that the whole of Vatican City could fit comfortably within its borders.
