# Power Plant (Civ1)

A Power Plant increases production by 50% and also increases pollution.
Civilopedia entry.
Power Plants burn fossil fuels, mainly oil and coal, to produce the heat and steam necessary to generate electricity. The importance of electric power is that each factory does not need a steam engine to power its machines. Centrally generated electricity is transmitted throughout the countryside to power machines everywhere. However, increasing demand for electricity requires the burning of ever greater amounts of fossil fuels, and this has led to problems with air pollution and acid rain. Since modern society cannot function without electricity, researchers are working to perfect other methods of power generation.
