In-Game.
Nzinga Mbande's unique [Agenda%20%28Civ6%29](agenda) is Decolonization. She likes [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) on continents where she has no [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) and dislikes those who have a city on her home continent.
Her [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader ability) is Queen of Ndongo and Mtamba. All cities on her home continent (including her {{Capital6}}) receive a 10% bonus to all yields, while cities on other continents receive a 15% penalty to all yields.
Detailed Approach.
