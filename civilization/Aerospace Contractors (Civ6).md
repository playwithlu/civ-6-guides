# Aerospace Contractors (Civ6)

Aerospace Contractors is a Wildcard [Policy%20Cards%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "".
Strategy.
Aerospace Contractors, as its name and the icon of the [Civics%20%28Civ6%29](civic) that unlocks it suggest, is well worth adopting if you're aiming for a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Science](Science Victory). The extra {{Aluminum6}} and {{Power6}} it provides to [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) with [Spaceport%20%28Civ6%29](Spaceports) will help them build and maintain [Lagrange%20Laser%20Station%20%28Civ6%29](Lagrange Laser Stations) and [Terrestrial%20Laser%20Station%20%28Civ6%29](Terrestrial Laser Stations), which will accelerate your exoplanet spacecraft's voyage to its destination. A possible secondary benefit is the boost to building up and/or maintaining your air force from whatever surplus {{Aluminum6}} you may gain from this policy.
