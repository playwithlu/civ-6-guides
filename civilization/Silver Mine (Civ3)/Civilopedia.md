# Silver Mine (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Although the Spanish gold doubloon is the most famous coin of the New World, from the
composition of Spanish treasure fleets it is clear that silver coins were much more plentiful.
The most famous silver deposit exploited by the Spanish was at Potosi in modern-day Bolivia.
Close to two billion ounces of silver were mined there by the Spanish. 
This New World wealth would be used to fund the glamour of the European Renaissance and
huge military endeavours such as the Spanish Armada that sailed against England in 1588.
