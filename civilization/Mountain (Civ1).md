# Mountain (Civ1)

This very rugged terrain can only produce a small amount of [Production%20%28Civ1%29](resources), but this can be increased by [Mine%20%28Civ1%29](mining). Mountains make the best defensive terrain, but the production is so low that they make a poor economic choice for the site of a city.
Mountains produce 1 resource and no [Food%20%28Civ1%29](food). [Gold%20%28Civ1%29](Gold) can be found in mountains which generate an extra 6 [Trade%20%28Civ1%29](trade).
It costs 3 Movement Points to travel over a Mountain region.
Mountains offer a +200% defense bonus.
