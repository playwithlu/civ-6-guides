# Sengoku - Sword of the Shogun (Civ3)

 (often called Sengoku for short) is a [List%20of%20scenarios%20in%20Civ3](scenario) in "".
Description.
The Sengoku period in Japan spans the Onin war in 1467, the emergence of Oda Nobunaga into Kyoto in 1568, and the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1603. It was in this period that battles, large and small, raged throughout Japan as warlords fought for the title of Shogun. War tactics changed drastically following the introduction of gunpowder and firearms by the Portuguese in 1543. Will you be able to battle and scheme your way into to the position of Shogun?
Intro.
Background.
It is the year 1450 AD, approximately 10 years before the rise of the Sengoku Daimyo. Your people have migrated from the Chinese and Korean mainland, and over the generations your people have learned the secrets of "farming, road-building," and "irrigation", and they are ready to settle down.
Victory.
Victory is achieved through the standard "Conquest, Domination" or "Diplomatic" means. For a Diplomatic victory, note that the necessary Wonder is the War Council (not the United Nations).
Note.
Japan is still largely uncivilized. Do not neglect the defenses of your villages! The Ainu barbarians you encounter are tougher and more numerous than you might expect. Also, a special feature in Sengoku is your ability to Shogun Upgrade your Daimyo (or King) unit as you progress up the Technology Tree.
