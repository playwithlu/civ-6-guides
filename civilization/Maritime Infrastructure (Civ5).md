# Maritime Infrastructure (Civ5)

Maritime Infrastructure is a [Social%20policies%20%28Civ5%29](social policy) in "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)". It was added in "[Brave%20New%20World](Brave New World)". It is part of the [Exploration%20%28Civ5%29](Exploration) tree.
The first step a wise ruler undertakes when willing to conquer the seas is to prepare the necessary infrastructure. Wharves, docks, warehouses, able sailors...all this helps to boost not only sea-related undertakings, but also general production capabilities of harbor cities. 
Strategy.
This is a great policy to start the tree with, especially if you have many [Coastal%20%28Civ5%29](coastal) [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities). +3 {{Production5}} in the [Medieval%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Medieval Era) could be a serious boost. Even in later eras, any newly founded coastal city will greatly benefit from this bonus (which is applied both retroactively to old cities, and to each new city, as long as they are found on the coast).
