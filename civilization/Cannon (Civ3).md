# Cannon (Civ3)

The Cannon is a more advanced artillery unit, capable of bombarding adjacent targets to reduce them before other units attack outright. Cannons have no attack or defense value, so they should be protected by an escort. Further, they are wheeled units, so they cannot enter mountains or jungles unless following a road.
A city must have both iron and saltpeter in its Strategic Resource box to build cannon.
