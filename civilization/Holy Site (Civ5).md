# Holy Site (Civ5)

Game Info.
Great tile improvement. Can be constructed by a [Great%20Prophet%20%28Civ5%29](Great Prophet) that has all its uses of "Spread Religion" remaining.
Strategy.
Holy Sites might not look so useful at first glance, but in the hands of a skilled player they can turn into a great boon. If your civilization adopts the [Piety%20%28Civ5%29](Piety) policy tree, they turn into an economical powerhouse, adding +3 and to their potential. Because such civilizations are more focused on Religion anyway, and may use for more things, these Great tile improvements become very important to them.
