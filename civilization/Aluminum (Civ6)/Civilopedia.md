# Aluminum (Civ6)/Civilopedia

The Greeks and Romans used aluminum salts as astringents and bath powders. For centuries, thatâ€™s all aluminum was good for, until in 1825 AD the Danish chemist Hans Orsted managed to create a lump of aluminum metal. In the 1850s, pure aluminum was so difficult to produce that bars of it were more valuable than gold and even exhibited as a curiosity at the Exposition Universelle in 1855. Scientists, of course, just had to find uses for it, and now aluminum is found in everything from spacecraft to skillets.
