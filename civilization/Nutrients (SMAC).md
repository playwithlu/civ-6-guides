# Nutrients (SMAC)

Nutrients are used to expand the population of bases.
Each population unit requires 2 units of nutrients to be maintained. Any extra enables population growth.
There are various ways to obtain nutrients.
Terrain.
Rainy areas are found to the west of mountains.
The [Monsoon%20Jungle%20%28SMAC%29](Monsoon Jungle) and the [Freshwater%20Sea%20%28SMAC%29](Freshwater Sea) squares provide an extra +1 Nutrient.
[Xenofungus%20%28SMAC%29](Xenofungus) produce no Nutrients at the start of a game, except for the [Gaia%27s%20Stepdaughters%20%28SMAC%29](Gaia's Stepdaughters) [Factions%20%28SMAC%29](faction) that gets a +1 bonus.
Nutrient production increases by one with the discovery of [Centauri%20Ecology%20%28SMAC%29](Centauri Ecology).
Terraforming.
By [Terraforming%20%28SMAC%29](terraforming), nutrient production can be increased through farms, soil enrichers, forests, kelp farms, condensers and even by raising mountains.
Condensers increase rainfall on arid and moist squares. A river may increase rainfall.
Base Facilities.
Certain structures can also increase nutrient production:
