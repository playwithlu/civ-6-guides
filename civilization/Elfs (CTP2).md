Unique unit.
The [Unique%20unit%20%28CTP2%29](unique unit) for this civilization is the [Archer%20%28CTP2%29](Archer). They also use the [Longbowman%20%28CTP2%29](Longbowman) and [Crossbowman%20%28CTP2%29](Crossbowman) (not to be confused with the [Orc%20Crossbowman%20%28CTP2%29](Orc Crossbowman)).
Notable cities.
There are four worlds where Elfs exist:
Middle Earth world, Third Age map.
No First or Second Age maps of Middle Earth were ever uploaded so the player never gets to play as theÂ Sindarian Elfs civilization.
Ultima 4 world.
There are no Elf civilizations in this scenario. The Elfs only make an appearance as unique units.
Elric.
Elric is of Elvish descent so his country is considered an Elvish Kingdom.
Discworld.
