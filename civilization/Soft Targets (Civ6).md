# Soft Targets (Civ6)

Soft Targets is a [Dark%20Age%20%28Civ6%29](Dark Age) [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) from the [Dramatic%20Ages%20%28Civ6%29](Dramatic Ages) [Game%20mode%20%28Civ6%29](game mode) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is available from the [Industrial%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Industrial Era) to the [Information%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Information Era) ([Modern%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Modern Era) in "") and uses a Wildcard slot.
Strategy.
Soft Targets is all about timing, and military intelligence. The best times to use it are at either the beginning or the end of a war: if an opposing [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) has a small military, attacking them with Soft Targets slotted could allow you to cripple them before they can react; if you've wiped out most of their military and are just trying to capture their last few [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) before the war ends, having Soft Targets slotted speeds up the process.
This policy may be the worst call, however, if you're on the backfoot and defending.
