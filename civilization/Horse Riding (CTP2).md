Great Library entry.
It is unknown when horses were first domesticated, but it is almost certainly after the domestication of dogs or of cattle. Historians have speculated that a tribe of Indo-European origin living in the steppes of central Asia may have been the first to use horses for more than just food.
Humans used horses for a variety of purposes. More than any other animal, the horse has had a unique, almost partner-oriented relationship with the humans it serves. It was used to plow fields and bring in the harvest, transport goods and carry passengers. It followed game and helped track cattle, and, most importantly, carried humans into battle and brought intrepid adventurers to far-off lands. Humans used horses for recreation and sport, in the form of jousting, carousels and the sport of riding.
