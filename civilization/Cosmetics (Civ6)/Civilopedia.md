# Cosmetics (Civ6)/Civilopedia

The use of cosmetics spans 6000 years and almost every civilization. In one way or another – ritual, religion, courtship, art – cosmetics have been a staple of being human. Even when frowned upon, as in ancient Rome (the wanton Cleopatra, for instance, was condemned for it) and ancient Israel (where Jezebel was lambasted for her painted eyes in the Old Testament). Even as late as 1900 AD using cosmetics was somehow disreputable, but the “Flapper Era” brought it to prominence in America and Europe, and made it a big business. The cosmetics industry has grown steadily ever since, driven by the “youth culture” prevalent today.
