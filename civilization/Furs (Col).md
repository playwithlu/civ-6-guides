# Furs (Col)

Fur is abundant in the Americas and there is a hungry market for it in Europe. Your fur traders can convert furs into coats for an even greater profit. Woodlands of all sorts are good for trapping, but even better are game and beaver squares in colder climates. Additionally, a road in a forest square increases fur output.
