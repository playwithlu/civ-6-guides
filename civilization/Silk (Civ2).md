Civilopedia entry.
Silk has been a valuable commodity for textiles since its properties were discovered in the 27th century BC. Silk is obtained from the cocoon of the silkworm moth, which was originally native to the forests of {{link2|China}}. The fine fibers of the cocoon is woven into cloth, which is used to make all types of clothing. Raw silk was obtained only from Asia until 550 AD, when two monks sent from the {{Link2|Roman Empire}} secretly stole silkworm eggs from China and brought them to Europe. Eventually, silkworms were found in many areas throughout the world. Less expensive synthetic fibers of the 20th century led to a decline in the silk market, but silk is still very popular in many types of clothing and other goods.
Commodity.
As a {{Link2|commodity}}, silk appears in cities near {{Link2|forest}}s, {{Link2|jungle}}s, or {{Link2|hill}}s. The supply of silk is increased for cities in the northeastern quadrant of the map and doubled for the {{Link2|Chinese}} and for {{link2|continent number}}s divisible by 5.
The value of a silk {{link2|caravan}} is tripled if it is in demand. Demand for silk is increased by the presence of {{Link2|desert}}s, {{Link2|plains}}, {{link2|swamp}}s, and jungle. Demand increases with {{Link2|city size}}, especially for those close to the map's equator and far from its prime meridian. It is potentially higher for cities on continent number 1.
Silk cannot appear as a supplied or demanded {{Link2|wildcard}} until a civilization has 32 [List%20of%20advances%20in%20Civ2](technologies).
