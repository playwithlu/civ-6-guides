# Magna Carta (CivRev)

The Magna Carta is a [Wonder%20%28CivRev%29](wonder) in "[Civilization%20Revolution](Civilization Revolution)".
This wonder can be built when the player discovers [Democracy%20%28technology%29%20%28CivRev%29](Democracy) and its benefit is that all the [Courthouse%20%28CivRev%29](Courthouses) built in the player's [City%20%28CivRev%29](cities) also produce [Culture%20%28CivRev%29](culture) as well as their usual benefit. This wonder's effect is also never canceled.
Note that this wonder is the earliest wonder you can build that has a continuous benefit that does not expire. For this reason, it is quite a worthwhile use of resources, as it will give you a benefit for a large chunk of the game - usually around 150+ turns.
