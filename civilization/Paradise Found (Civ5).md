Scenario Description.
Aloha, great Polynesian king! You currently rule over one of the great islands of your people. Though life on your lush, tropical paradise is an idyllic one, you thirst for even more greatness across the waves. Your people have invented wayfinding, a sophisticated navigation system that relies on your knowledge of the stars, the birds, and the currents of the mighty Pacific Ocean. Your bold navigators are ready to strike out hundreds of miles across the open ocean in their double-hulled canoes, questing for new islands to colonize. Can you successfully traverse the deadly waves and find a foothold beyond your original coastal home? Can you expand your island's culture and dominate the mighty Pacific?

Special Rules.
There are all new tech and social policy trees appropriate to the scenario's Pacific Ocean setting. Each of the four major civilizations starts with a unique trait and can gain the usual Polynesian unique bonuses (Moai improvement and Maori Warrior unit) through research. Grow your empire as large as you want; the cost of social policies does NOT increase based on number of cities in the empire.
