# Corvée (Civ6)

Corvée is an Economic [Policy%20Cards%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
This is the earliest Policy which accelerates the construction of [Wonder%20%28Civ6%29](Wonders). It is available quite early, and usually may be used to aid construction of all Wonders after [Stonehenge%20%28Civ6%29](Stonehenge). The problem is that Tier 1 [Government%20%28Civ6%29](governments) (with the exception of [Classical%20Republic%20%28Civ6%29](Classical Republic)) have only one Economic slot, so if you want to aid your Wonder construction, you'll have to either forgo all other possible Economic Policies or slot them in your government's Wildcard slot. [Urban%20Planning%20%28Civ6%29](Urban Planning), the other early -oriented Policy, aids general construction in all your [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities); in contrast, Corvée gives you a greater boost for Wonders at the expense of that could be used for [Units%20%28Civ6%29](units), [District%20%28Civ6%29](districts), or [Buildings%20%28Civ6%29](buildings). Think carefully about whether the investment is worth it for your [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization), gameplay style and chosen [Victory%20%28Civ6%29](victory) path, and be sure to remove Corvée as soon as you finish (or fail to finish) a Wonder.
Under Classical Republic, you can use both this Policy and Urban Planning for a substantial boost in without the loss of development momentum!
