Strategy.
Perfectly suited for early rushes, the Pictish Warrior can lay waste to opponents' lands, quickly pillaging and moving within the same turn. It can then decimate their armies thanks to its combat bonus in foreign lands. As if that weren't enough, it earns for each unit it kills, constantly advancing your religious goals while at war.
An upgraded Pictish Warrior retains its foreign lands and pillage bonuses, but loses the ability to earn .
Note that, unlike the Spearman that it replaces, the Pictish Warrior doesn't receive a combat bonus against mounted units.
