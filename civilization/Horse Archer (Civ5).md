# Horse Archer (Civ5)

Game Info.
[Unique%20unit%20%28Civ5%29](Unique) early ranged mounted unit of the [Hunnic%20%28Civ5%29](Hunnic) [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilization). Replaces the [Chariot%20Archer%20%28Civ5%29](Chariot Archer).
Strategy.
The Horse Archer is highly superior to the unit it replaces: first, it doesn't require to produce; second, it doesn't have the rough [Terrain%20%28Civ5%29](terrain) penalty that its counterpart does, making it a more versatile and powerful early archer unit; and third, it already starts with a [Promotions%20%28Civ5%29](promotion) that makes it more powerful in open terrain. Furthermore, since this promotion isn't a "special" promotion, you can build off it and train to the extremely powerful higher-tier promotions simply by killing [Barbarian%20%28Civ5%29](Barbarians)!
This combination makes the Horse Archer a very dangerous unit, which is available very early in the game. It is best used for swift hit-and-run attacks, whittling down the enemy, and preparing [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities) for capture by your [Warrior%20%28Civ5%29](Warriors) and [Battering%20Ram%20%28Civ5%29](Battering Rams).
