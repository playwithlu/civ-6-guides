# Faith (Civ6)

 Faith is one of the main statistics in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It represents an empire's power in matters of the immaterial and the spiritual world. Faith is used as a currency to fuel a [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization's) religious pursuits, similar to how is used as a currency for political functions and civilization upkeep. However, now that we have a whole [Victory%20%28Civ6%29](victory) type dedicated to Religion, Faith becomes as important as , if not even more important.
Mechanics.
 Faith accumulates into a pool and is spent mostly on empire level, just like , but unlike it there is nothing that spends Faith automatically. The only exception is the founding of a [Pantheon%20%28Civ6%29](Pantheon), which the game will prompt you to do automatically when you gather more than 25 Faith. After that the player must decide how to spend accumulated Faith in the best way possible.
Uses.
Religion.
 Faith is primarily used in [Religion%20%28Civ6%29](Religion) and its activities. First, it can be used to found a [Pantheon%20%28Civ6%29](Pantheon), which requires 25 Faith. After you found a Religion, or after any of your cities with a [Holy%20Site%20%28Civ6%29](Holy Site) has been converted to a Religion, Faith can be used to purchase [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Religious](religious units) there, including:
As with purchases, the Faith price of successive units will rise (except for Warrior Monks, whose price is always 200 Faith). This is more important here, since there is no way to produce religious units - as the game progresses, you will have to necessarily spend more and more Faith for new ones.
Other unit purchases.
Certain [Military%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](military units) can only be purchased with Faith, including:
In [vanilla](vanilla) "Civilization VI", Faith can be used to buy land military units if your civilization has adopted [Theocracy%20%28Civ6%29](Theocracy) as its [Government%20%28Civ6%29](government). In "", Faith can be used to buy land military units if your civilization has built the [Grand%20Master%27s%20Chapel%20%28Civ6%29](Grand Master's Chapel) in its [Government%20Plaza%20%28Civ6%29](Government Plaza), making it equal to in this respect.
The [Ages%20%28Civ6%29%23Dedications](Monumentality Golden Age Dedication) allows buying [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Civilian](civilian units) with Faith, including the very important [Settler%20%28Civ6%29](Settler) to expand your empire!
Finally, Faith can be used to purchase [Naturalist%20%28Civ6%29](Naturalists) and [Rock%20Band%20%28Civ6%29](Rock Bands), which are important for a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Cultural Victory).
Building purchases.
If the Religion your cities follow has certain Beliefs, you will also be able to purchase Tier 3 religious buildings, such as the [Cathedral%20%28Civ6%29](Cathedral) or the [Mosque%20%28Civ6%29](Mosque). But, under special circumstances, other [Building%20%28Civ6%29](buildings) and [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](units) may also be purchased with Faith - look for the special descriptions of game items! Again, as with , purchasing multiple buildings with Faith won't raise their price.
[Divine%20Architect%20%28Civ6%29](Divine Architect), a title for [Moksha%20%28Cardinal%29%20%28Civ6%29](Moksha), allows the city he's established in to purchase entire districts with Faith.
Patronage.
 Faith can be used at all times to purchase via [Great%20People%20%28Civ6%29%23Attracting%20via%20Patronage](Patronage), which makes it useful even to civilizations who didn't found a religion and are not interested in [Theological%20combat%20%28Civ6%29](theological combat). Those will simply save up their Faith until the right moment, then spend it to patronize a .
Recalling Heroes.
In the [Heroes%20%26amp%3B%20Legends%20%28Civ6%29](Heroes &amp; Legends) [Game%20mode%20%28Civ6%29](game mode), dead Heroes may be recalled (or resurrected) using Faith. The amount of Faith needed scales with the passing of eras.
Sources.
 Faith primarily comes from Holy Site districts and their respective buildings, the (+2 Faith) and the (+4 Faith). The Holy Site is one of the first s in the game, unlocking early in the [Ancient%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Ancient Era), and thus is also one of the first sources of Faith for your nascent empire. Additionally, Holy Sites' [Adjacency%20bonus%20%28Civ6%29](adjacency bonuses) are relatively easy to activate and thus boost your early production; also each Specialist Citizen grants +2 Faith. 
Religious [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-states) may grant up to +4 Faith in every Holy Site district (+2 Faith for each Shrine and Temple instead of base district in "Rise and Fall"), depending on the number of s assigned to that particular city-state, plus an additional +2 Faith in the . 
With the [Ethiopia%20Pack%20%28Civ6%29](Ethiopia Pack) and the new [Diplomatic%20Quarter%20%28Civ6%29](Diplomatic Quarter), religious city-states may now grant up to +6 Faith in every Holy Site district (+1 Faith for each Shrine, +2 Faith for each Temple and +3 Faith for each Worship building), depending on the number of s assigned to that particular city-state, plus an additional +1 Faith in the .
Resources.
Certain [Resource%20%28Civ6%29%23Luxury](luxury resources) grant Faith bonuses. These include:
As with all Luxuries, they are available right from the start, and could turn into an important Faith source early in the game. Their significance wanes later.
Policy Cards.
There are several [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](policy cards) which grant additional Faith boosts and income. These are:
Of these, [God%20King%20%28Civ6%29](God King) is one of the very first Policy Cards unlocked (earned after developing the very first [Civic%20%28Civ6%29](civic), [Code%20of%20Laws%20%28Civ6%29](Code of Laws)). It may be used to start producing Faith as early as Turn 10â€“15, if you have no other sources available.
Pantheons.
Many [Pantheon%20%28Civ6%29](Pantheons) grant Faith bonuses related mostly to [Terrain%20%28Civ6%29](terrain):
Pantheons are another very important early source of Faith, although their effects can be felt even in the late game, under the right circumstances.
Religious Beliefs.
Some religious Beliefs grant respective Faith bonuses, including:
Worship Buildings.
Even more important than the Beliefs listed above are the [Beliefs%20%28Civ6%29%23Worship](Worship Beliefs), which unlock the special class Worship Building. These can be built as level 3 buildings in your Holy Site districts for large amounts of Faith, as well as other bonuses. However, these buildings usually become available later in the game, as you establish and develop your Religion and enhance your cities and Holy Sites. The various different Worship Building Faith bonuses are as follows:
Wonders.
A substantial number of Wonders grant their civilizations Faith bonuses upon completion. These include:
 Faith can also be obtained through [Natural%20wonder%20%28Civ6%29](natural wonders):
Unique Bonuses.
There are many unique pieces of infrastructure and [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](civ/leader abilities) that grant special Faith bonuses:
