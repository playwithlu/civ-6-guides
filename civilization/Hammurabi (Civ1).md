# Hammurabi (Civ1)

Hammurabi is known for having united the regions of Babylonia and Akad-Sumer into a small empire that was comparable in size to the Akkadian Empire that existed a few centuries before him, except not including [Babylon%20%28city%29](Babylon). He leads the [Babylonian%20%28Civ1%29](Babylonians) in "[Sid%20Meier%27s%20Civilization](Sid Meier's Civilization)".

Gameplay.
The Babylonians tend to be too perfectionist with their [City%20%28Civ1%29](cities) to present any real threat in the game. Only if they are left alone on a good-sized island, so they may build a few beautiful and large cities, eventually their [List%20of%20advances%20in%20Civ1](scientific advances) make them formidable. In the early stages of the game they make pleasant neighbors.
On the [Earth%20%28map%29%20%28Civ1%29](Earth map) the location that the Babylonians occupy means players from [Africa](Africa) or other parts of Eurasia have to go around them. If you find yourself between the [Greek%20%28Civ1%29](Greeks), [Indian%20%28Civ1%29](Indians)/[Mongol%20%28Civ1%29](Mongols), [Russian%20%28Civ1%29](Russians), and [Egyptian%20%28Civ1%29](Egyptians), for example, this can make for a very short game. Also, if you're Babylon and the Egyptians are in the game you won't be able to explore Africa unless you build a naval vessel.
