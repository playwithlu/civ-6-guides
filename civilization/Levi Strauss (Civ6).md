Similar to other Great Merchants that grant unique luxuries, Levi Strauss' ability can give [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) a needed boost to their yields in the late game, as well as provide mass amounts of from trading with the [AI](AI) in [single%20player](single player). However, a bonus luxury resource, while nice, is not usually worth spending or on recruiting. The exceptions are when playing as [Scottish%20%28Civ6%29](Scotland), which can turn into and ; and as [Montezuma%20%28Civ6%29](Montezuma), who can turn luxuries into Combat Strength. Strauss is a gamechanger for both Scotland and Montezuma, and should be a high priority for both of them.
