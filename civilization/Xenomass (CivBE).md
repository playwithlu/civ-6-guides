# Xenomass (CivBE)

Game Info.
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{XenomassBE}} is seen on the map as a greenish bubbling pool, and is a {{LinkBE|strategic resource}} that is special to {{LinkBE|Harmony}} players. It is always visible, and is accessed with a {{LinkBE|Xenomass Well}}. It is usually found underneath [Alien%20Nest%20%28CivBE%29](Alien Nests), but can also be found scattered elsewhere on the map. Alien Nests have a chance to respawn on any Xenomass tile that is covered by [Miasma%20%28CivBE%29](miasma), unless there is a player unit sitting on the tile.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

Strategy.
The Xenomass is the primary source of alien life. As such, whenever there is a Xenomass tile covered in Miasma, you can be sure an [Alien%20nest%20%28CivBE%29](Alien nest) will eventually develop there; unless of course, you yourself start using the resource. 
Apart of this special factor, the Xenomass offers rich opportunities for organic matter harvesting (once the proper safety technologies have been developed), turning into a great source of {{FoodBE}} for your colony. But apart of that, Xenomass can turn into an all-out contributor when you develop the above-mentioned technological upgrades, making it one of the most diversely-contributing resources to your colony.
