# Temple of the Sun (Civ3)/Mesoamerica/Civilopedia

The Temple of the Sun is one of three major structures built by Can-Balam (or "Snake-Jaguar"), one-time ruler of Palenque and son of the great Mayan Lord Pacal. This building, along with the Temple of the Cross and the Foliated Cross, provide curious insights into the reigns of these two mighty kings, and suggests changes that were taking place in the role of Mayan kingship. 
Lord Pacal had descended to the Palengue throne through his mother's hereditary line, something rarely seen in Mayan "patrilineal" society. Thus, both Pacal and his son felt compelled to conduct a major public relations campaign confirming their rightful ascension to power. They used these structures as a way of justifying their divinity, by etching upon the walls heiroglyphics showing their mother's direct connection to the "First Mother" (the goddess who created the Mayan gods and first kings). And Can-Balam even used the Temple of the Sun as a way to show (and remind) the Mayan citizenry of his glorious exploits in battle.
