# Stele (Civ5)

Strategy.
The Stele provides an additional 2 production, giving a big boost in the early game toward religion. Also, it is available right from the start of the game, allowing the Ethiopian player to start producing earlier than anyone else (except the [Celtic%20%28Civ5%29](Celts), of course). It is advisable to build it first thing in each new Ethiopian city.
