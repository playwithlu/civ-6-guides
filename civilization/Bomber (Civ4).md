# Bomber (Civ4)

Strategy.
Bombers are land-based aircraft. They can attack enemy land units (and [Naval%20unit%20%28Civ4%29](sea units), but not very effectively), and they can weaken enemy [City%20%28Civ4%29](city) fortifications. Bombers cause [Collateral%20damage%20%28Civ4%29](collateral damage) when attacking.
Missions.
Bombers can quickly lay open city defenses and unleash devastating Air Strike attacks. They are, however, vulnerable to [Intercept%20%28Civ4%29](interception), especially from [Fighter%20%28Civ4%29](Fighters).
