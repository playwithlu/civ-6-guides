# Yongle (Civ6)

The Yongle Emperor (2 May 1360 – 12 August 1424), personal name Zhu Di, was the third emperor of the , ruling from 1402 to his death. His reign saw the construction of the [Forbidden%20City](Forbidden City) and the , the compilation of the monumental , [Zheng%20He](Zheng He)'s and a significant reformation and expansion of the . He leads the [Chinese%20%28Civ6%29](Chinese) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Yongle controls his [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) with [Project%20%28Civ6%29](Projects) at first, and larger cities receive additional {{Gold6}}, {{Science6}} and {{Culture6}} from their [Population%20%28Civ6%29](population).
In-Game.
Yongle's unique [Agenda%20%28Civ6%29](agenda) is Yinding. He likes [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) with positive {{Gold6}} income per turn and dislikes those with negative {{Gold6}} income.
His [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader ability) is Lijia. His cities gain access to three unique Lijia projects, which can convert 50% of their {{Production6}} into {{Food6}} or {{Faith6}}, or 100% of their {{Production6}} into {{Gold6}}. Additionally, from "" onward, cities with 10 {{Population6}} Population or more gain 2 {{Gold6}}, 1 {{Science6}}, and 1 {{Culture6}} for each {{Population6}} Population.
Detailed Approach.
Yongle wants to control his population with his Lijia ability. In his cities, unique projects convert their {{Production6}} into {{Food6}}, {{Faith6}} or {{Gold6}}. Then, when the city reaches 10 population, the population celebrates with additional {{Gold6}}, {{Science6}} and {{Culture6}}. His civilization ability further helps his {{Science6}} and {{Culture6}} progression with better and free [Boost%20%28Civ6%29](Eurekas and Inspirations). The [Crouching%20Tiger%20%28Civ6%29](Crouching Tiger) helps protect his empire from invaders, but it is the [Great%20Wall%20%28Civ6%29](Great Wall) that makes him a powerful force towards a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture%20Victory](Culture Victory).
