# Norse Tradition (Civ3)/Civilopedia

The Viking way of life and society differed greatly from other European civilizations'. Much like the 
Germanic and Gallic tribes of Roman times, the Viking nations were not really coherent states. Local 
warlords and chieftains would often name themselves kings, but in practice their power extended only to their 
local subjects. Primogeniture, the practice of passing on land holdings and other family wealth to the eldest son, 
was virtually unknown, and almost all political titles and offices were elective rather than hereditary. This often 
entailed shifting power blocs and fierce civil wars, as disputed elections and successions were commonplace.
Viking countries did not adopt Christianity until the 10th century C.E.; before that, their religion consisted of 
a rich and warlike pagan mythology. In that mythology gods and giants often interfered with mortal affairs, and mortal 
warriors could enjoy a perpetual afterlife of feasting and fighting in the halls of Valhalla. The Norse mythology, like 
Christianity, was also apocalyptic, foretelling a great battle at the end of the world. The battle would be followed by the 
resurrection of Baldur, a benevolent and peaceful god, who would forgive sins and accept all the souls of the good and virtuous 
to sit at his side. The similarities between this mythology and Christian ideas in the Book of Revelation may explain why 
Christianity caught on so easily in the Norse lands.
