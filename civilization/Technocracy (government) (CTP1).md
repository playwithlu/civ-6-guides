Gameplay.
This somewhat inhumane form of government of the 22nd centuryÂ was based on the idea of a group of technological elitists enriching themselves on the backs of the middle and lower class. In order to stifle discontent, they basically offered them drugs. Through a combination coercion, robotics and pharmaceuticals, the technological elites have made an effective form of government that enriches them while only further impoverishing the classes beneath them.
This is a good government to use in-game if you have to get the upper hand on an opponent with little to no downside.
History.
By the 22nd century, as overcrowding blighted the world, the economic and technological elite made a pact with the devil. Surrender the rights of the poor and the freedoms of the masses in return for excess riches for the wealthy. Backed by robotic production, state sanctioned drug distribution, and an ever-present automated security system, this new Technocracy resulted in increased productivity and consumption. With elevated cities for the rich, the less glamorous effects were not even visible.
