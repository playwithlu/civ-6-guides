# Air Sweep (Civ5)

Air Sweep is an action that can be performed by [Fighter%20%28Civ5%29](Fighters) and [Jet%20Fighter%20%28Civ5%29](Jet Fighters). It forces them to scout out a tile, forcing the use of any Interceptions by enemy units for that turn. This paves the way for your bombers to fly in safely.
