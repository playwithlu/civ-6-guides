# Mathematics (Civ6)

Mathematics is a [Classical%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Classical Era) [Technology%20%28Civ6%29](technology) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It can be hurried by building three different specialty [District%20%28Civ6%29](districts).
Strategy.
The science of all sciences provides the foundation of all future learning. It is indeed difficult to enumerate all the benefits the invention of this system of quantifying nature provides. Ironically, its immediate benefits are not that great - it only allows all naval vessels to move faster, thanks to the various improvements in sailing technology made possible by basic math. With Mathematics, [Petra%20%28Civ6%29](Petra) is unlocked, a precious [Wonder%20%28Civ6%29](wonder) for any [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) with a [Desert%20%28Civ6%29](Desert) [City%20%28Civ6%29](city).
Mathematics unlocks the entire upper part of the tech tree in the [Medieval%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Medieval Era), so you will need it sooner or later - sooner if you intend on building Petra, later if you don't particularly care for advancement (Mathematics, along with [Apprenticeship%20%28Civ6%29](Apprenticeship), unlocks [Education%20%28Civ6%29](Education)). In the latter case, you should focus on researching Apprenticeship and other techs from the lower part of the Medieval Era tech tree.
Beelining Mathematics is not very easy: you need to research [Pottery%20%28Civ6%29](Pottery), [Writing%20%28Civ6%29](Writing), [Currency%20%28Civ6%29](Currency) first, none of which have many practical applications. This becomes practically impossible if you're threatened by other civs, because you will desperately need to research military techs (like [Iron%20Working%20%28Civ6%29](Iron Working) and [Engineering%20%28Civ6%29](Engineering), which are on the lower part of the tech tree) first.
