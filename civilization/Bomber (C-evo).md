# Bomber (C-evo)

The free-to-play game [C-evo](C-evo) has no predesigned bomber unit. Players have to design their own, once they have the required technologies.
"Bombs" is one of the "Capacities" under "Unit features". It requires knowledge of [Advanced%20Flight%20%28C-evo%29](Advanced Flight). It adds "1" to the production cost base value and to the weight.
The effect is stated as "Attack base value +2 for first attack to a ground or sea target after start from city, carrier or military base". One way of interpreting that is: for every weapons module you delete, you can add one bombs module for twice the attack strength - but you can unleash only one set of bombs per flight.
If you delete all weapons modules so as to maximize the bombing strength, the unit will become a civil unit after bomb discharge until next refuel stop.
