# Carpenter's Shop (Col)

The Carpenter's Shop is one of the buildings you receive for free with every colony. It is a workplace where your colonists convert [Lumber%20%28Col%29](Lumber) into [Hammer%20%28Col%29](Hammers). An unskilled colonist converts 3 Lumber to 3 Hammers each turn; a [Master%20Carpenters%20%28Col%29](Master Carpenter) doubles this rate.
The Carpenter's Shop may be upgraded to a [Lumber%20mill%20%28Col%29](Lumber mill).
