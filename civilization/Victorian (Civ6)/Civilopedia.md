# Victorian (Civ6)/Civilopedia

The mostly temperate southeast region of Australia has long earned its reputation as a garden state. Although cabbage production is year-round, not every Victorian is personally responsible for maintaining their own patch.
Melbourne was founded by John Batman in 1835. It wasn’t the first settlement in the region, but it grew important enough to be named capital in 1851, when the new Crown colony of Victoria split from New South Wales. Good luck for the Victorians who discovered a massive quantity of gold that same year, kicking off a gold rush that would bring many fresh faces to their colony.
Those who had no luck panning or mining were still living in a moderate (for Australia) climate around the people who had struck it rich, allowing them to extract the gold directly through services or skullduggery. With the exception of a particularly painful economic crash in 1893, Victoria’s fortunes remained up.
