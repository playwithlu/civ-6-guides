Tier 1.
Tier 1 CNDRs are quite weak - they have no perks and no passives. Their only bonus is that they have the same Strength as a Tier 3 Soldier and are available slightly earlier - this might make them a bit useful in long-game-speed matches. 
Tier 2.
Tier 2 CNDRs are slightly more effective - they have higher than typical Tier 3 and Tier 4 Soldiers and cost roughly the same but they now benefit from swarm bonuses, making them increasingly difficult to deal with. Usually it is best to destroy CNDR swarms with splash damage, which can additionally be prevented using SABRs and other long-range support fire such as planes.
