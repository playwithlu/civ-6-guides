Any player aiming for a Science Victory will need at least one Spaceport to undertake the required projects.

The Martian colony projects can be completed in any order, and each one can be undertaken at a different Spaceport, so having three different [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) with Spaceports can greatly expedite the final stages of the Space Race.
