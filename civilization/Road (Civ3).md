# Road (Civ3)

Roads increase the output of [Commerce%20%28Civ3%29](commerce) and can be built in any [List%20of%20terrains%20in%20Civ3](terrain) except water squares.
Also, [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ3](units) moving along roads expend one third of a movement point per square, regardless of terrain type. Roads cannot cross a [River%20%28Civ3%29](River) until the development of [Engineering%20%28Civ3%29](Engineering), which allows for bridgebuilding. This will also sever the domestic [Trade%20network%20%28Civ3%29](Trade network).
[Worker%20%28Civ3%29](Workers) are ordered to build roads by pressing [R] or the [Build%20Road%20%28Civ3%29](Build Road) button.
