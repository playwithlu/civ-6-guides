# Civil Prestige (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Private sponsorship of public works is a way to boost the prestige of the individual, and was commonly practiced in Rome during the late Republic and early Empire. It was a way to gain the support of the populace through endowing public amenities, such as baths, basilicas, and aqueducts, so that when the patron came to stand for election to a higher office, he could ensure a reliable base of support.
