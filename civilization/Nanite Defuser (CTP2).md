In the mid-21st century, nanotechnology had found applications in countless realms, from science and engineering to manufacturing and construction. One of the most dramatic and far-reaching uses of nano-machines was the invention of the nanite defuser. Developed by a coalition of nations, the nanite defuser consisted of a timed release of 2 million nanites into the air for seeking out weapons-grade plutonium and uranium. Guided by gamma rays, the nanites honed in on the highly radioactive substances contained in nuclear missiles around the world and rendered their triggers inoperative. The nanites then continued to attack the radioactive substances, working to break them down. The reaction of the world community to the nanite defuser was overwhelmingly positive. People rejoiced, as the world was once again free from the frightening and destructive power of nuclear weapons. What had been a dream for centuries was finally a reality.
