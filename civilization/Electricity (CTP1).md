Summary.
The discovery of Electricity opens the door to the modern era. With Electricity, Edison's Lab becomes a powerful force driving new technologies and pooling scientific talent to give the Civilization an average of 10 free Advances per Age. In addition, Electricity allows for improvements in mining leading to the development of Advanced Mines.
Great Library entry.
The generation and storage of Electricity required the fusion of three disparate phenomenon: vacuums, magnetic fields, and chemistry. The Industrial Revolution provided the necessary infrastructure for its discovery. Experiments with vacuums led scientists to discover the electric field. Meanwhile, experiments with rotating magnets led to the first constant currents and to a new theory of magnetic fields. The final piece came in the form of the battery - a chemical system of storage, which ended the transient nature of electric current.
