Historically, mobile human bands depended on nature's bounty to survive. Unfortunately, deserts supported less than one person for every hundred square kilometers, and even on the coastal plains, the land supported only one person per square kilometer. As a result, few human bands grew beyond two thousand persons before splitting into new groups. Once these bands settled to farm, they grew quickly to form villages and cities.
