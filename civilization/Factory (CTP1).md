The Industrial Revolution began in the early 1700s and extended to the end of the 19th century, giving rise to the modern Factory. Borrowing from one hundred years of British expertise, Francis Cabot Lowell constructed the Lowell Mill at Waltham, MA in 1814 with the world's first power loom. By centralizing the machinery of production and by studying the behavior of the workers with stopwatches and slow motion photography, Lowell brought a new level of efficiency to production.
