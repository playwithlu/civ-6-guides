# Specialists (Civ1)

Specialists, though not called that in game, are created by clicking a square being worked in the [city%20%28Civ1%29](city) screen. The citizen is removed from working that square, and becomes an Entertainer by default. He can then be clicked again to change him to a Taxman or a Scientist.
