# Atomic Bomb (Civ3)/Civilopedia

The Atomic Bomb (or "A-Bomb") was developed and first used by the Americans during WWII under the
auspices of the Manhattan Project, which produced two types of A-bombs
that were ready for use by the end of July, 1945. The responsible scientists were more confident of
the bomb they nicknamed "Little Boy", which depended upon an explosive device to ignite its deadly
load of Uranium-235 to produce an explosion of immense proportions. They were less confident of their
second bomb, "Fat Man", which depended on plutonium (Pu-239) to produce a massive implosion. As events
turned out, when the bombs were delivered to their respective targets of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
both functioned with deadly precision. Shortly thereafter Japan -- acknowledging that continuation
of the war against such destructive power would be foolish -- surrendered.
