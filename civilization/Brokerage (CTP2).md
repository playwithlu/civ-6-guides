Great Library entry.
In the 1700s, securities trading took place mainly in the parks and coffeehouses of London, Philadelphia and New York City. Traders called out names of companies and numbers of shares available in an open auction, and shares went to the highest bidder. Trading increased on both sides of the Atlantic considerably in the late 1700s, and, in 1773, several stockbrokers opened the London Exchange in the heart of the financial district. In the first quarter of the 1800s, the London Exchange found a permanent home in Capel Court, Bartholomew Lane, the Philadelphia Board of Brokers set up central brokerage offices and brokers in New York established the New York Stock Exchange Board.
Brokerages later evolved to offer several financial services under one roof, including securities trading, commodities trading, bonds trading and general banking.
