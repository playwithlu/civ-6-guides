# Native life (SMAC)

Flora.
Xenofungus is the only native plant species found on [Planet%20%28SMAC%29](Planet). It grows on land as well as sea. [Terraformer%20%28SMAC%29](Formers) can be used to remove it from tiles, as well as to plant it. Native lifeforms can move through it without problems, but anything else is slowed down considerably unless certain technology has been researched.
Native lifeforms can move through xenofungus at a cost of 1/3 of movement point (equivalent to that of a human unit through roads). A general human unit may take maximum 2 point to move, same as a forest/rocky area. This can change, however; the discovery of [Centauri%20Psi%20%28SMAC%29](Centauri Psi) will allow for some relaxation of that limitation, while possession of the [The%20Xenoempathy%20Dome%20%28SMAC%29](Xenoempathy Dome) will allow the faction's units to travel through them as if they were roads.
Under normal conditions, conventional units standing in xenofungus gain a defensive combat bonus in conventional combat equivalent that of being in a forest. However, a conventional unit standing in xenofungus will be at a severe disadvantage in psionic combat; psionic units attacking them will have a 50% bonus. Conventional units controlled by the faction that controls the [The%20Pholus%20Mutagen%20%28SMAC%29](Pholus Mutagen) will gain the bonuses normally possessed by native lifeforms.
A faction that has discovered [Centauri%20Psi%20%28SMAC%29](Centauri Psi) can build some terraforming improvements even through xenofungus. However, no matter one's faction's technological advancement, bases cannot be built in xenofungus.
Unit move through fungus may excite native lifeforms to appear to attack. The chance depend on a series of factor, like road, sensor, etc... SMAX-specific lifeforms also appear in dense patch of fungus (at least 3x3).
Fauna.
All three animal lifeforms found in the game have seven states they can go through: Hatchling, Larval Mass, Pre-Boil, Boil, Mature Boil, Great Boil, Demon Boil. These designations, known as lifecycle, are analogous to the [Morale%20%28SMAC%29]("morale") system applied to conventional units.
In the [Alien%20Crossfire%20expansion%20pack](Alien Crossfire expansion pack), new species were added.
Notable Details.
Alpha Centauri lifeforms attack and defend with psi. Factors affecting psi strength are elite level/larval states, fungus patch (terrain) and Planet rating. Morale only affect production's result, and normal terrain factor won't be calculated in any equation.Â 
They can not be altered like other units can.
Lifeforms receiving support from a base (because they were made there), that end their turn in fungus won't cost mineral support.
Native lifeforms can be captured by sending a combat unit to attack them. The chance to capture depend on Planet ratings, and the capturing unit must have a full move. Captured are always Independent, costing no minerals to support.
Lifeforms produced by factions are affected by lab, centaury reserve, and specifically mentioned facilities. They are not affected by Command Center, Airforce, or Naval Yard.
