# Grassland with Shield (Civ3)

The areas of land between [Desert%20%28Civ3%29](desert) regions and [Forest%20%28Civ3%29](forests) in temperate and tropical climates usually consist of grassland. Some grasslands contain mineral deposits and other useful materials. These have a rock outcropping to symbolize this and produce a Shield if worked in a city radius.
