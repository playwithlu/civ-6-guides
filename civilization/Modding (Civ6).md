# Modding (Civ6)

Modding, short for modifying, means taking a game and modifying it. These modifications are called [mods](mods) for short. "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)" has very extensive modding capabilities, allowing users to add, change, or remove a large amount of content. Mods are a file, or collection of files, that are able to modify some aspect of the game. Mods are capable of doing a large number of things, ranging from the simple and minor (such as making [Mountains%20%28Civ6%29](Mountains) passable) to the highly complex and dramatic (such as adding several new [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) and [Leaders%20%28Civ6%29](leaders)).
Seasoned modders started making mods to the game as soon as it came out. However, the official tooling and Steam Workshop support were added a few months after the launch, in the [Civilization%20VI%20February%202017%20Update](Civilization VI February 2017 Update).
WARNING.
Modding, if you do not know what you are doing, can be dangerous. DO NOT download files on the internet without certainty of what it is and what it does. Somebody may claim that a website has a mod, but instead it will install a virus on your computer. Below is a list of sources where it is recommended to find "Civilization VI" mods.
It is also possible to corrupt save files or make the game crash. Different mods change different parts of the game, so some mods can conflict with other mods and result in a crash, bizarre functionality, or glitches.
Common Mod Sources.
This is a list of websites where mods are typically posted, and where it is recommended to download mods. Each has a "Danger Rating", this being the likelihood (or lack thereof) of viruses being disguised as mods on these websites. Bear in mind that while some are not perfect, these are still the best places to find mods.
Civilization VI Steam Workshop.
The [Steam](Steam) client has a built in means of downloading and installing mods, and is possibly one of the safest means of getting mods. Unlike the other sources where you have to manually install the mod, Steam does this automatically if you use the Steam Client, and you can download simply by clicking the "Subscribe" button on a mods page.
Nexus Mods.
Nexus Mods is a commonly used mod website with a built in download scanner for viruses and a fairly strict moderation team.
CivFanatics Civilization VI Creation &amp; Customization Sub-forum.
[CivFanatics](CivFanatics) is a very popular, widely used, and long lasting website dedicated to all things "[Civilization%20%28series%29](Civilization)". The Creation &amp; Customization Sub-Forum for "Civilization VI" is the place where threads are posted if they related to mods or modding. The website has moderators, so the odds of a thread containing a virus rather than a mod is low. However, as it is a place where anyone can post, you should still remain cautious if you find a thread by a new user or that has few replies.
The Civilization /r/civ Subreddit.
[Reddit](Reddit) is a popular website where people can make "Subreddits" (essentially sub-forums) based on any topic, and this is the subreddit for "Civilization". Anything related to "Civ" can be posted here, so most things are not mods. However, some mods can be found here. This is a place where anyone can post, so be wary of unknown files, but there are subreddit moderators so posts that are on the front page typically are fine.
