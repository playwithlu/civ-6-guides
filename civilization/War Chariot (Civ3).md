# War Chariot (Civ3)

[Egyptian%20%28Civ3%29](Egyptian) War Chariots take the place of normal [Chariot%20%28Civ3%29](chariots). They move quickly and will withdraw
from combat if they are losing (unless fighting another fast unit).
A city must have [Horses%20%28Civ3%29](horses) in its Strategic Resource box to build a war chariot.
