# Empath (SMAC)

Empaths are specialist citizens in "[Sid%20Meier%27s%20Alpha%20Centauri](Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri)".
Empaths have actually learned to use the psi potential of their brains, providing +2 to both {{LinkSMAC|Economy}} and {{LinkSMAC|Psych}} per empath. They require {{LinkSMAC|Centauri Meditation}}, and are rendered obsolete by {{LinkSMAC|Secrets of Alpha Centauri}}, replaced by [Transcend%20%28SMAC%29](Transcends).
