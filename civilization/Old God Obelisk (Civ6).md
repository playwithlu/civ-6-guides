# Old God Obelisk (Civ6)

+1 additional {{Culture6}} if [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) is at maximum Loyalty.
+1 slot for [Great%20Work%20%28Civ6%29](Great Works) (any type).
The Old God Obelisk is a [Building%20%28Civ6%29](building) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is exclusive to the [Voidsingers%20%28Civ6%29](Voidsingers) secret society in the [Secret%20Societies%20%28Civ6%29](Secret Societies) [Game%20mode%20%28Civ6%29](game mode), introduced in the [Ethiopia%20Pack%20%28Civ6%29](Ethiopia Pack). It is built in the [City%20Center%20%28Civ6%29](City Center) and replaces the [Monument%20%28Civ6%29](Monument).
Strategy.
The Old God Obelisk's bonuses allow for some massive strategic advantages when it comes to [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) which get bonuses from [Great%20Work%20%28Civ6%29](Great Works). [Leaders%20%28Civ6%29](Leaders) like [Menelik%20II%20%28Civ6%29](Menelik II), [Mvemba%20a%20Nzinga%20%28Civ6%29](Mvemba a Nzinga), [Eleanor%20of%20Aquitaine%20%28Civ6%29](Eleanor of Aquitaine), and [Jadwiga%20%28Civ6%29](Jadwiga) can get great use out of the bonus Great Work slot it provides.
Menelik II can leverage his Council of Ministers [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](ability) to get extra {{Science6}} and {{Culture6}} out of these buildings, especially if they contain {{RelicIcon6}} Relics. This bonus can be blown out of proportion if Menelik's founded [Religion%20%28Civ6%29](religion) has the Reliquaries belief. Menelik can also stack [Chorus%20%28Civ6%29](the second Voidsinger promotion) to get extra {{Science6}} and {{Culture6}}, as well as using [Canticle%20%28Civ6%29](the third promotion) as a means of gaining easy {{RelicIcon6}} Relics.
Mvemba a Nzinga can use the [Kongolese%20%28Civ6%29](Kongolese) ability Nkisi to use these extra slots as sources of income, {{CitizenIcon6}} Population growth and {{Production6}} for his [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities), allowing them to get off their feet faster by moving the Great Works there. While the {{Faith6}} he gains from these buildings may not exactly be useful to him, there is nothing stopping him from using the {{Faith6}} as a minor buffer later on with the second Voidsinger promotion, or using it to recruit a [Rock%20Band%20%28Civ6%29](Rock Band) or [Naturalist%20%28Civ6%29](Naturalist) later on.
Eleanor of Aquitaine also allows for some flexible uses of the building, namely with the usage of her ability Court of Love, allowing her to gain extra slots in her cities to make enemy cities disloyal much faster and without needing to immediately invest {{Production6}} into building districts like the [Holy%20Site%20%28Civ6%29](Holy Site) or a [Theater%20Square%20%28Civ6%29](Theater Square). Plus, the ability to put any Great Work into the Old God Obelisk's bonus slot allows you to save a lot of time trying to build a [Temple%20%28Civ6%29](Temple) and getting a {{RelicIcon6}} Relic into it. Even if her ability boosted by this building is not enough, she can eventually get the third Voidsinger promotion to purchase [Cultist%20%28Civ6%29](Cultists), making cities disloyal even faster or even causing massive waves of rebellions through clever Great Work placement or [Spy%20%28Civ6%29](Spy) and Cultist application.
Lastly, Jadwiga will gain an extra +4 {{Gold6}} and +2 {{Culture6}} and {{Faith6}} from {{Relic6}} Relics generated by Cultists when they expire, which can easily support either of [Polish%20%28Civ6%29%23Important%20note%20on%20Victory%20paths%20with%20Poland](Poland's main victory paths).
