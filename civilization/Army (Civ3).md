# Army (Civ3)

An Army is a group of ordinary [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ3](units) that move and fight together. To form an army, you must build the Army unit
and then "load" other units into it. You can load up to three units, though increases this limit to four, if you have built it.
Building an Army.
Armies can be built in [City%20%28Civ3%29](cities) that have the [Military%20Academy%20%28Civ3%29](Military Academy) or a [Leader%20%28Civ3%29](Leader) in them. You must have at least four cities in addition to four cities per army you have at the time that you start building an army. That is, generally you need four cities per army. But if you start building an army and subsequently lose cities to below the four city threshold, you still retain the ability to complete that army.
In Battle.
An army uses one, some, or all its internal units to fight a battle, depending upon the course of the fight. It functions as one unit with triple or quadruple the [hit%20points](hit points). Therefore, an army can usually defeat any given single unit of comparable strength.
