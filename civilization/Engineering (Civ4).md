# Engineering (Civ4)

Strategy.
Engineering allows production of the [Pikeman%20%28Civ4%29](Pikeman), excellent against mounted units and the city-smashing [Trebuchet%20%28Civ4%29](Trebuchet) siege unit. It increases road movement and allows construction of [Castle%20%28Civ4%29](Castles) and the [Notre%20Dame%20%28Civ4%29](Notre Dame) wonder.
