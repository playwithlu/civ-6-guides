Eternal Kombat is a [List%20of%20scenarios%20in%20CivRev](scenario) in "[Civilization%20Revolution](Civilization Revolution)".
Description.
"If you were a super-powered warrior that could earn upgrades more easily and have no fear of enemy borders, would you ever want to stop fighting? We didn't think so. In "Eternal Combat," the civs have no word for peace in their langauges, so war is all-encompassing and never-ending. All civs start with three cities to get them conquering as soon as possible. Military units making 'em even more devastating."
Gameplay.
In this scenario, all five civilizations start with three cities and they cannot declare peace with each other. All units' attack strength is increased by 1 and may grant special abilities per 2 victories instead of 3.
Strategy.
The [Aztec%20%28CivRev%29](Aztec) is the best civilization in this scenario, given the elimination of the need to heal wounded troops after a fight. This has great potential toward early domination if Jaguar Warriors are [Rush%20%28CivRev%29](rushed) using the wealth of gold the Aztecs begin with, as it allows for an army to be assembled in as few as two turns.
