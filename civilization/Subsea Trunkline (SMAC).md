# Subsea Trunkline (SMAC)

 is a [base%20facility%20%28SMAC%29](base facility) in "[Sid%20Meier%27s%20Alpha%20Centauri](Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri)". It was added in the "[Alien%20Crossfire](Alien Crossfire)" expansion.
Strategy.
Increases minerals by 1 on every square (in the sea). Not terribly useful except maybe for sea bases or coastal bases in extremely mineral-poor areas. And you are probably better off organizing those bases for population and energy rather than construction anyway.
