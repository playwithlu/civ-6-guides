Gameplay.
Forests provide a substantial bonus to the {{LinkCTP2|Production}} output of {{LinkCTP2|Cities}}. However, one cannot build any {{LinkCTP2|Tile Improvements}} except for {{LinkCTP2|Roads}}. {{LinkCTP2|Rivers}} that run through Forest tiles substantially increase {{LinkCTP2|Food}}, {{LinkCTP2|Production}} and {{LinkCTP2|Commerce}}.
After the discovery of the {{LinkCTP2|Agricultural Revolution}} Advance, players can {{LinkCTP2|Terraform}} Forest tiles.
Exotic {{LinkCTP2|Hardwood}} and {{LinkCTP2|Bears}} are the trade {{LinkCTP2|Goods}} native to Forest tiles.
