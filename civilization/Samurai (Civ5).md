[Unique%20unit%20%28Civ5%29](Unique) melee unit of the [Japanese%20%28Civ5%29](Japanese) [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilization). Replaces the [Longswordsman%20%28Civ5%29](Longswordsman).Â Requires .
Strategy.
The Samurai are strong frontline units that are unique to the Japanese available in the late [Medieval%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Medieval Era) and useful throughout the [Renaissance%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Renaissance Era). These units are nominally stronger than the next frontline unit, the [Musketman%20%28Civ5%29](Musketmen), provided that the Samurai fight in open [Terrain%20%28Civ5%29](terrain). Samurai also come with Great Generals II [Promotions%20%28Civ5%29](promotion), so direct attacks with them will be very effective in generating [Great%20General%20%28Civ5%29](Great Generals) for the Japanese.
Since Shock I is innately given to Samurai, upgrading [Swordsman%20%28Civ5%29](Swordsmen) to Samurai provides the Shock I promotions if the unit doesn't possess them already, so it may be a good idea to go towards Drill promotions instead with these units. Like the relationship between [Alhambra%20%28Civ5%29](Alhambra) and the two unique units with innate Drill I promotions (the [Mehal%20Sefari%20%28Civ5%29](Mehal Sefari) and the [Minuteman%20%28Civ5%29](Minuteman)), the free Shock I does not turn into Shock II or Shock III because the unit already had Shock I to begin with.
The Samurai have received the ability to build [Fishing%20Boats%20%28Civ5%29](Fishing Boats) on appropriate [Resources%20%28Civ5%29](resources) when embarked in the [Fall%202013%20patch%20%28Civ5%29](Fall 2013 patch), and this can be used to help out [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities) with coastal resources. However, this ability does not transfer on upgrade, so the Japanese or a civilization that receives Samurai from a [City-state%20%28Civ5%29](city-state) may wish to retain them as Samurai to save the that might otherwise go to [Work%20Boat%20%28Civ5%29](Work Boats). Samurai cannot construct [Offshore%20Platform%20%28Civ5%29](Offshore Platforms), however, so a civilization that possesses them will still need to invest in Work Boats to work coastal .
The Samurai upgrades to the [Rifleman%20%28Civ5%29](Rifleman), not the Musketman like the Longswordsman it replaces. That means the Japanese will still need to maintain a source of for each unit until the acquisition of the [Rifling%20%28Civ5%29](Rifling) tech in the [Industrial%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Industrial Era), rather than at [Gunpowder%20%28Civ5%29](Gunpowder) right next to this unit's prerequisite technology, [Steel%20%28Civ5%29](Steel), available in the Renaissance Era.
As the Samurai receives the Shock I promotion and is not [obsolete](obsolete) until Rifling, it becomes one of the units that may acquire high-tier promotions such as Blitz or March right away at production if built on a city with Barracks, Armory, and a combination of a [Military%20Academy%20%28Civ5%29](Military Academy), [Brandenburg%20Gate%20%28Civ5%29](Brandenburg Gate), and/or the Total War tenet in the Autocracy [Ideology%20%28Civ5%29](ideology). In addition, since the Samurai is a melee unit, it receives the bonus from the [Warrior%20Code%20%28Civ5%29](Warrior Code) [Social%20policies%20%28Civ5%29](policy).
