# Oxford University (Civ4)

Strategy.
Oxford University greatly increases the scientific output of its [City%20%28Civ4%29](city). It also allows you to change three citizens into [Scientist%20%28Civ4%29](scientists) and increases its city's chance of generating a [Great%20Scientist%20%28Civ4%29](Great Scientist).
This wonder synergizes well with the [Commerce%20%28Civ4%29](Commerce) bonus of the [Bureaucracy%20%28Civ4%29](Bureaucracy) [List%20of%20civics%20in%20Civ4](civic). Move your [Palace%20%28Civ4%29](Palace) to your best commerce city, switch to Bureaucracy, and build this wonder there for maximum [Science%20%28Civ4%29](science) output.
