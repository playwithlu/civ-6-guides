Great Library entry.
The original ancient Greek Academeia was located on the northwestern periphery of Athens on a piece of property acquired by Plato in 387 BC. It consisted of an olive grove, park and gymnasium, and was primarily a college of philosophy. Organized for the worship of the Muses, the Academy instructed young men in mathematics, dialectics and natural science. Those who attended were of noble birth as the these schools' primary intent was to prepare patrician boys for lives as statesmen. A scholarch (or headmaster) was elected for life by a majority of the members of the corporate body that organized the school. Plato himself taught there until the end of his life, and often gave public lectures on diverse subjects.
The Academy went through many changes of philosophy throughout the centuries of its operation. It was, but for a brief period in which Arcesilaus ran the school, a center of Platonism until AD 529, when the emperor Justinian closed it and all other pagan schools. The moniker academy also applied not only to Plato's famous institution but to schools of philosophy during the time of the Roman orator and statesman, Marcus Tullius Cicero (106-43 BC).
