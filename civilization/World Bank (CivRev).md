# World Bank (CivRev)

The World Bank is a [Wonder%20%28CivRev%29](wonder) in "[Civilization%20Revolution](Civilization Revolution)".
Building the World Bank is the final step in winning an [Victory%20%28CivRev%29](Economic Victory). Only once you have accumulated 20,000 [Gold%20%28currency%29%20%28CivRev%29](gold) (i.e. reached the eighth economic milestone) can you build the World Bank.
Like the [United%20Nations%20%28CivRev%29](United Nations), the World Bank can't be rushed by spending gold or using a Great Builder.
