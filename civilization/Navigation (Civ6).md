# Navigation (Civ6)

Navigation is a Wildcard [Policy%20Cards%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
This is probably one of the most pointless policy cards in the game. Different from the [Encampment%20%28Civ6%29](Encampment), the Harbor is a powerful fulfilling both militaristic and economic purposes. It is what happens when an Encampment and a Commercial Hub fuse into one, and then add even more , , , and on top of that. Any naval civilization would want to have a Harbor in every single city of theirs if possible, which means they will end up with more s than they ever need. A precious Wildcard policy slot should be dedicated for something else more significant, or just overall, more useful.
