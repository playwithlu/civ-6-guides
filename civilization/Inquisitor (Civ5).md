# Inquisitor (Civ5)

Game Info.
Religious unit. Can only be purchased with in any with a majority that has been Enhanced.
Strategy.
Inquisitors are your defense from other religions. They have two uses:
Note that an Inquisitor doesn't stop normal religious pressure from cities and other sources from converting your citizens.
A useful tactic for Inquisitors is to allow a player to permanently remove a competing religion from the game. This can only be done after capturing the [Holy%20City%20%28Civ5%29](Holy City) for the religion. Once it is captured, move the Inquisitor to the city and remove the religion. This will permanently destroy this religion and allow you to replace the religion in other cities without having to worry about the constant pressure from the Holy City.
