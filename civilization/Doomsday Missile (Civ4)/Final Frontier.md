# Doomsday Missile (Civ4)/Final Frontier

 is a unit in "[Final%20Frontier](Final Frontier)", a mod in "".
Strategy.
Doomsday Missiles are similar to regular Missiles, except once reaching their target they unleash nuclear devastation upon it. The Doomsday Missile works the same way as a Tactical Nuke from the base game. It can only jump from a friendly City to City in order to nuke enemy solar systems. Obviously building these on "scarce" solar systems is a complete waste of Hammers but given the time to prepare, you can build a Starfortress to increase your influence and to produce anti-ship missiles every 15 turns. This works as a safe for Missiles, Nuclear missiles included.
