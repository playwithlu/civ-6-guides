# Julius Caesar (Civ6)

Gaius Julius Caesar (12 July 100 BC – 15 March 44 BC) was a prominent Roman general and statesman. Considered one of history's greatest military commanders, he led the Roman armies to victory in the {{w|Gallic Wars}} and, after defeating his rival {{w|Pompey}} in a {{w|Caesar's civil war|civil war}}, seized power and declared himself {{w|Dictator perpetuo|dictator}}, beginning a programme of {{w|Constitutional reforms of Julius Caesar|political reforms}} until {{w|Assassination of Julius Caesar|his assassination}} in 44 BC. He leads the [Roman%20%28Civ6%29](Romans) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Julius Caesar wants to conquer every [hex](hex) of the [Map%20%28Civ6%29](map), vanquishing both [Barbarian%20%28Civ6%29](Barbarians) and opposing [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations).
In-Game.
Julius Caesar's unique [Agenda%20%28Civ6%29](agenda) is Gallic Wars. He likes civilizations that destroy [Barbarian%20%28Civ6%29%23Outposts](Barbarian outposts) and dislikes civilizations that ignore Barbarian outposts.
His [List%20of%20leader%20abilities%20in%20Civ6](leader ability) is Veni, Vidi, Vici. He receives 300 {{Gold6}} upon first capturing a [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) and clearing a Barbarian outpost, with both rewards increasing to 500 {{Gold6}} after he researches [Metal%20Casting%20%28Civ6%29](Metal Casting) and 700 after [Steel%20%28Civ6%29](Steel) (and all rewards scaling with [Speed%20%28Civ6%29](game speed)).
Detailed Approach.
Unlocking [Legion%20%28Civ6%29](Legions) at [Iron%20Working%20%28Civ6%29](Iron Working) is key for [Victory%20%28Civ6%29](victory) with their increased {{StrengthIcon6}} Combat Strength. Then take the Legions onward to disperse Barbarian Camps and conquer opposing cities. Julius Caesar’s additional {{Gold6}} for these conquests will help propel him to a large empire and army. Additional {{Gold6}} will come in from his "All Roads Lead to Rome" ability, and you can appease the masses with your [Bath%20%28Civ6%29](Baths) providing additional {{Amenities6}}. His military might is best for a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Domination](Domination Victory).
