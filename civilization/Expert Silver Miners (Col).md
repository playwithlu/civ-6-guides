# Expert Silver Miners (Col)

Like ore mining, [Silver%20%28Col%29](silver) mining is an important and lucrative skill that is widely understood in [Europe](Europe).
The best place to find silver is in the [Mountains%20%28Col%29](mountains), especially where there are deposits.
Since silver will be depleted after a while, it may be more effective to build a 1 population colony with just a Silver Miner to exploit the resource instead of a fully functioning colony. Once the resource is depleted, the lone miner can disband the colony to build a new silver mining colony, or join a larger settlement.
