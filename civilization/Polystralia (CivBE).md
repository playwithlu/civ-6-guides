Polystralian Strategies.
The Polystralian faction provides a boost to your number of trade routes. This can prove quite valuable in the early game, as you will be able to quickly develop new Outposts and trade with Stations while maintaining a steady income. However, later on this advantage will taper off as the other factions will up their number of cities, thus expanding their own trade routes. So if you pick Polystralia, be sure to maximize your trade advantage right off the bat for maximum exploitation.
