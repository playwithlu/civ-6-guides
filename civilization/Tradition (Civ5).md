# Tradition (Civ5)

Tradition is a [Social%20policies%20%28Civ5%29](social policy) tree in "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)". It is always available at the start of the [Ancient%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Ancient Era), and aims to provide growth and {{Capital5}}-centric bonuses, especially for tall strategies and [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities) with an individually high {{Population5}} count.
Game Info.
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;Tradition is best for small empires.
Adopting Tradition greatly increases the rate of [Borders%20%28Civ5%29](border) expansion (25%) in cities (by diminishing the accumulated {{Culture5}} needed for successive new tiles) and also grants +3 {{Culture5}} in the {{Capital5}}. Unlocks building the [Hanging%20Gardens%20%28Civ5%29](Hanging Gardens) wonder ({{BNW}} only).
Adopting all Policies in the Tradition tree will grant +15% {{FoodIcon5}} Growth in all cities and:
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
Strategy.
If the {{Capital5}} is in a good spot and expansion is not necessary, this tree will likely be a good one to pick. A number of these policies benefit that city, excepting Oligarchy and Legalism (and depending on where you decide to build your {{Link5|Wonders}}). This tree favors scientific civs as its bonuses are {{Food5}}- and {{Population5}}-oriented, and Oligarchy only affects garrisoned (and so defensively positioned) [Unit%20%28Civ5%29](units).
