# F4F Wildcat (Civ3)/Civilopedia

The F4F Wildcat was the primary carrier-based fighter of the U.S. Navy at the start of WWII. Although
the Japanese Zero was faster and more maneuverable, the Wildcat was rugged and reliable, and
could stand a great deal of damage before succumbing to a deep blue grave. Its four (later six) 50 cal.
machineguns were an effective, if unspectacular, armament. The F4F Wildcat performed well in all major battles
in which it was involved before being supplanted by the improved F6F Hellcat fighter. However, even after the
introduction of the F6F, the lower-performance F4F Wildcat continued to be used aboard the smaller escort
carriers until the end of the war.
