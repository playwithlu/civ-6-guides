# Crater (Civ3)

Craters are the result of a successful [Bombard](Bombard) attack on a tile, which destroys all the units on it or bombarding an empty tile (one without improvements). It requires work to remove or may have improvements directly built upon it.
Like [Pollution%20%28Civ3%29](Pollution), the presence of craters reduces the output of all resources on a tile by one, making it less productive than usual.
