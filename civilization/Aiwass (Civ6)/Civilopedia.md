The light flows through us now. In the streets, as people stand and talk, great wisps of light stream from their mouths. Sometimes, in a burst of excitement, one of your alchemists will dissipate into a slow-moving cloud of floating motes. Others report a sudden awareness of the hollowness of formerly-solid objects - a vacuum created in a boulder, an expanse under the street, new continents under the Earth's crust.
