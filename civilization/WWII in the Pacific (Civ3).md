# WWII in the Pacific (Civ3)

 is a [List%20of%20scenarios%20in%20Civ3](scenario) in "".
Description.
War has been declared! It is December, 1941 and the "peaceful" Pacific Ocean is about to witness the full fury of air, naval and land warfare during World War II. A military-rich but resource-poor Japan has dangerous assault forces poised to attack complacent Allied bases in Malaya and the Philippines. Far to the northeast, near Hawaii, a powerful Japanese naval-air strike force is within range of the "unsuspecting" U.S. fleet stationed near Honolulu.
Intro.
Background.
It is December, 1941. For several years the Empire of Japan has been expanding its holdings: westward into China and, following the fall of France in Europe, southwestward into French Indochina. To counter Japan's aggressive moves, a coalition of western nations seeks to deny Japan access to the rich oil and rubber resources of Malaya. Now, in late 1941, Japan is poised to strike powerful blows against the Allied nations in order to form and secure the "Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere".
Special.
This scenario opens with the "Japanese Empire" (Japan) already at war against the "Allies" (a Locked Alliance of America, the Commonwealth, China and the Netherlands).
Victory.
Victory is achieved by the first side to amass 40,000 VP, "or" gain 66% of the terrain "and" 46% of the population. Otherwise, the winner is the side with the highest score at game end (February 1946; 50 turns). Coalition Victory Conditions are in effect.
Note.
To simulate the surprise of the Japanese attack, Allied nations' units (United States, the Commonwealth, China and the Netherlands) can't move or attack during the first turn (December 1941). As Japan, time is "not" on your side. You must strike quickly and decisively! Locate, capture and secure VP locations, and destroy as many Allied units as possible. Try to avoid a long, drawn out war of attrition.
Naval Unit Designations.
Make note of the following designations used in this scenario: CV - Aircraft Carrier; BB - Battleship; CA - Heavy Cruiser; DD - Destroyer; and SS - Submarine.
Gameplay.
The scenario begins right before the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941.
