Civilization: Beyond Earth Fall Update
City growth.
A city grows by storing enough {{FoodBE}} required to increase the population by 1.
For the specific amount of {{FoodBE}} required to increase the population by 1 at different city sizes, see
[Food%20%28CivBE%29](Food (CivBE)).
Virtues.
You gain new [Virtues%20%28CivBE%29](Virtues) by collecting {{CultureBE}}.
The costs for new Virtues increases with the number of virtues you possess.
The formula to calculate the cost is:
Culture required = 4"n"² + 20 
(3n² + 15 for Sputnik difficulty)
where "n" is the number of Virtues you already possess.
Each new founded city increases the cost of acquiring new virtues by 9% - 10%.

Health effects.
A colony has a net health based on its total {{HealthIconBE}} minus its total {{UnhealthIconBE}}. Depending on the net health of a colony, certain bonuses apply to the entire colony. These are all listed in the main article [Health%20%28CivBE%29](Health (CivBE)).
