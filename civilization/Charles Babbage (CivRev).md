History.
Charles Babbage (1791 - 1871) was an English mathematician and inventor and is credited with envisioning the first programmable computer. He is remembered for designing two devices - the Difference Engine and the Analytical Machine. The Difference Engine was a massive hand-cranked machine capable of creating numerical tables more accurate than even modern calculators. Babbage's Analytical Machine was capable of performing complex calculations based on human input - the first computer. While Babbage himself completed neither of these works - in part because of his own ceaseless perfectionism - working machines based on his designs would be completed by later researchers, proving his creations both viable and decades before their time.
