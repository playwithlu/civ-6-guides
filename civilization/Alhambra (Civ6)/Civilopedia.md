# Alhambra (Civ6)/Civilopedia

The Alhambra began as a small fortress, constructed in 889 AD by the Moors of Granada in Andalusia (Spain); then it was rebuilt and expanded by the emir Mohammed ben Al-Ahmar in the 11th Century and yet again expanded and converted into a royal palace by Sultan Yusuf I in 1333. The al-Hamra (literally, “the red one”), so named for its red clay fortress walls, was lavish – at least by European standards of the time – with all the comforts, including indoor plumbing. It integrated the natural beauty of the spot with structures and gardens designed and outfitted by the finest Muslim, Jewish, and even Christian craftsmen and artisans of the region. Among its most striking aspects, many of the interior walls and columns are inscribed in carved flowing Arabic script with poetry and verses from the Quran. The last sultan of the Nasrid dynasty, Muhammad XII, surrendered Granada to the Spanish in 1492 AD, without the Alhambra being attacked by the crusaders – otherwise it would be just another pile of rubble and memories of elegance.
