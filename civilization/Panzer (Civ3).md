# Panzer (Civ3)

The [German%20%28Civ3%29](German) Panzer is an awesome offensive and screening unit that can attack multiple times
in a single turn and withdraw from combat if losing the fight (unless fighting another fast unit, of course).
A city must have both oil and rubber in its Strategic Resource box to build Panzers.
The Panzer replaces the [Tank%20%28Civ3%29](Tank).
Trivia.
The Panzer is based on the tank.
