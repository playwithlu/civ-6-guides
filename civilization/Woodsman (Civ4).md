# Woodsman (Civ4)

Woodsman I.
This promotion means that the unit, if defending in woodlands or jungles, will be 20% stronger.
The [Jaguar%20%28Civ4%29](Jaguar) unique unit for the [Aztec%20%28Civ4%29](Aztec) and the [Explorer%20%28Civ4%29](Explorer) recon unit both start with this promotion. No others do.
Woodsman II.
This promotion will make the unit 50% stronger if defending in jungle or forest tiles. More importantly, it will allow the unit to move twice as fast in those tiles. For units with 2 or more moves, this stacks with [Mobility](Mobility) for even further movement.
This promotion is commonly used to assist choke tactics, using a fast-moving melee unit to pillage and retreat into favourable terrain.
Woodsman III.
This promotion will mean that the unit with it will be not only 50% better at defending forest and jungle units than an unpromoted unit, but also at attacking them. This is useful to counter another Woodsman unit or a well-defended wooded point.
On top of that, the [Healing%20%28Civ4%29](healing) effect is like a free and more potent [Medic%20%28Civ4%29](Medic I) promotion - 15% vs 10%, but it also stacks. Woodsman III and Medic I will heal the same as Medic III, (except on tiles adjacent to the healer) and doesn't require a [Great%20General%20%28Civ4%29](Great General). Of course, these can all stack together for a massive bonus, and make a particularly potent healer.
Finally, 2 first strikes helps reduce the risk of your super-Medic dying if they attack (and it makes it even better at attacking woods).
