18th century liberal philosophy concerned with protecting the rights of the individual against the pretensions of authority, formed the basis for the United States and the democracy which it eventually adopted. In his 1836 Gettysburg Address, Lincoln defined democracy as "government of the people, by the people, for the people." Although these were the American goals, they were not the reality.
