# Household Cavalry (Civ3)/Civilopedia

There were two distinct branches of British heavy cavalry during the
Napoleonic era: the household regiments and the heavy dragoons. The
Household units consisted of the Life Guards and the Royal Horse Guards.
These heavy cavalry units were used sparingly during the early years of the
Napoleonic wars, but came to prominence after 1812 (and especially at the
Battle of Waterloo). These heavy units were used as "shock" troops to 
bolster in a wavering line or to charge and shatter an enemy formation.
