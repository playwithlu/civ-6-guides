# Horseman (Civ3)

The first mounted unit you can build, Horsemen move fast and will withdraw from combat if losing (unless
fighting another fast unit).
A city must have horses in its Strategic Resource box to build a horseman.
Variants.
The [Iroquois%20%28Civ3%29](Iroquois), instead build the [Mounted%20Warrior%20%28Civ3%29](Mounted Warrior). A more powerful horseman at no additional cost.
