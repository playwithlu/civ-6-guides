Strategy.
El Cid, with his ability to form Corps two [Era%20%28Civ6%29](eras) before you normally can, is one of the most powerful and worthwhile Great Generals for all domination-focused [Leaders%20%28Civ6%29](leaders) (with the exception of [Shaka%20%28Civ6%29](Shaka)). Due to the power of his retire effect, it is probably best to retire him instead of sending him out to war alongside your army.
