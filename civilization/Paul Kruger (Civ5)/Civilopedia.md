# Paul Kruger (Civ5)/Civilopedia

Affectionately known as "Oom Paul," Stephanus Paulus Kruger was state president of the Transvaal Republic (1883-1900) and gained international fame as the leader of the Boer resistance to British imperialism in South Africa. A skilled military commander, Kruger was equally adept at negotiation, such as those that ended the First Anglo-Boer War that ended in 1881. Serving as president a fourth time, as British forces closed in on the capital during the Second Boer War, Kruger fled into exile, never to return to Africa.
