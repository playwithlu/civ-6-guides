# Theology (Civ6)

Theology is a [Classical%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Classical Era) [Civics%20%28Civ6%29](civic) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It can be hurried by founding a [Religion%20%28Civ6%29](Religion).

Theology is nothing less than the first attempt to apply science to religion, not to the natural world. With religion starting to play an even greater part in everyday life in great kingdoms, it becomes inevitable that some philosophers dedicate themselves to studying religion and everything related to it. This elevates religion itself to a whole new level, and enables the second religious building in the [Holy%20Site%20%28Civ6%29](Holy Site): the [Temple%20%28Civ6%29](Temple). This, in turn, will later unlock the full potential of Religion thanks to the new unit it unlocks - and moreover, it will allow the later development of new [Governments%20%28Civ6%29](governments)!
