# Farm (Civ5)

Game Info.
Basic agricultural improvement. Available from the start of the game. 
Strategy.
Farms can be constructed on almost any land tiles to improve a hex's output. Having access to [Water%20%28Civ5%29%23Fresh%20Water](fresh water) enhances a Farm's effect on tiles earlier because Civil Service is available well before Fertilizer.
