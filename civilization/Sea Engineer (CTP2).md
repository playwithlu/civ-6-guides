The Sea Engineer is a [List%20of%20units%20in%20CTP2](unit) in "[Call%20to%20Power%20II](Call to Power II)".
Gameplay.
The Sea Engineer Settles Sea Colonies. Like a [Settler%20%28CTP2%29](Settler) or [Urban%20Planner%20%28CTP2%29](Urban Planner), building the Sea Engineer removes a [Population%20%28CTP2%29](Population) point from the [City%20%28CTP2%29](City) in which it is built.
Great Library entry.
As land became scarce, nations began to look to the sea to build cities. Unfortunately, the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean made it difficult construct large-scale projects. The development of nanotechnology in the late 21st century opened up new frontiers in exploration, construction and science. The sea engineer was the first mobile nano-assembly vehicle developed for underwater construction. Using the latest robotics technology, the sea engineer was capable of molecular-level construction of solid materials.
