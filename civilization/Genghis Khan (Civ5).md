Personality and Behavior.
Genghis Khan is very aggressive as always, and will most likely seek a [Domination%20victory%20%28Civ5%29](domination victory).
Genghis puts a high priority on raising a large offensive army consisting primarily of fast-moving mounted [Unit%20%28Civ5%29](units), such as [Horseman%20%28Civ5%29](Horsemen) and [Cavalry%20%28Civ5%29](Cavalry). In later [Era%20%28Civ5%29](eras), these are replaced by armored units, including [Tank%20%28Civ5%29](Tanks).
Genghis will likely go to war with every [City-state%20%28Civ5%29](city-state) he meets.
Genghis tends to declare war on every [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilization) he meets. He is one of the [Leaders%20%28Civ5%29](leaders) least likely to forgive a transgression, and he will seek to gain and use [Nuclear%20weapons%20%28Civ5%29](nuclear weapons).
Despite being a warmonger, Genghis Khan can be quite surprisingly friendly. If the player can befriend him, he will become one of the most loyal allies. This is especially true if Genghis sees the player as a warmonger.
Genghis will not try to build many [List%20of%20wonders%20in%20Civ5](wonders).
If Genghis gets into a battle with you earlier on, make sure you build plenty of [Spearman%20%28Civ5%29](Spearmen), [Pikeman%20%28Civ5%29](Pikemen), and [Lancer%20%28Civ5%29](Lancers) as they can counter his mounted units well.
Trivia.
Recent discoveries in genealogical mapping suggest that about 8% of men in Asia (roughly 0.5% worldwide) can trace their ancestry directly back to Genghis Khan.
Intro.
Greetings o great Temujin, immortal emperor of the mighty Mongol Empire! Your fists shatter walls of cities and your voice brings despair to your enemies. O Khan! You united the warring tribes of Northern Asia into a mighty people, creating the greatest cavalry force the world has ever witnessed. Your people's cunning diplomacy divided their enemies, making them weak and helpless before Mongolia's conquering armies. In a few short years, your people soldiers conquered most of China and Eastern Asia, and the empire continued to grow until it reached west into Europe and south to Korea. Indeed, it was the greatest empire ever seen, dwarfing those pathetic conquests of the Romans or the Greeks.
Temujin, your people call upon you once more to lead them to battle and conquest. Will the world once again tremble at the thunderous sound of your cavalry, sweeping down from the steppes? Will you build an empire that stands the test of time?
