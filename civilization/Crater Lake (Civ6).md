Strategy.
Crater Lake's tile has a yield of 5 and 1 . Since faith is often hard to generate early in the game, founding a city next to the lake can provide a vital head start with founding an early .
Like ordinary lake tiles, the yields of Crater Lake's tile can be increased using certain bonuses. If the wonder tile is owned by a city with a Lighthouse and Seaport, the yield of its tile will increase by 1 and 2 respectively. Owning the wonder will also increase the Lake's yields by 1 and 1 . The bonus of the city-state further increases the tile yields by 1 , and by an additional 1 once the has been reached. [Nan%20Madol%20%28Civ6%29](Nan Madol's) bonus of +2 will apply to any [District%20%28Civ6%29](district) built next to the Crater Lake.
