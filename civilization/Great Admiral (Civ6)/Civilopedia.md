# Great Admiral (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Some are born with salt water in their veins, and so take to a life at sea. In the past, these were the “great” admirals, leading voyages of exploration, trading shots across the bow with other warships, and terrorizing innocent merchant vessels. Once men found that they could sail across open water and not (usually) drown, ships of all sorts took to the shallow and deep seas. Yi Sun Shin, Cristoforo Colombo, Horatio Nelson, Isoroku Yamamoto, David Farragut, and the list goes on of those who made a name for themselves at sea. Thanks in large part to their efforts, the world shrank and civilization expanded. But, maybe they had no choice. As Jacques Yves Cousteau (who would have been a heck of an admiral if he were so inclined) wrote: “The sea, once it casts its spell, holds one in its net of wonder forever.”
