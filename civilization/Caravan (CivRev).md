# Caravan (CivRev)

The Caravan is the emissary of a [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20CivRev](civilization's) economy. By guiding these units to foreign [City%20%28CivRev%29](cities), you will immediately get a wealth of [Gold%20%28currency%29%20%28CivRev%29](gold) added to your treasury, the amount of which depends on the distance the Caravan has traveled from the city in which it was built. The owner of any city where a Caravan arrives also receives a small amount of gold. Like [Settlers%20%28CivRev%29](Settlers), however, Caravans are defenseless and can be captured by another civilization, though this will cause a war.
