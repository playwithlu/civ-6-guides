The Quarry is another early -boosting improvement, albeit one that can only be built on certain resources. It is, however, less oriented towards aiding and more oriented towards providing a more diverse set of benefits. With the [Stone%20Circles%20%28Civ6%29](Stone Circles) [Pantheon%20%28Civ6%29](pantheon) every Quarry turns into a major generator, which is very important early-to-mid game.
Just like the [Mine%20%28Civ6%29](Mine), Quarries provide a +1 [Adjacency%20bonus%20%28Civ6%29](adjacency bonus) to your [Industrial%20Zone%20%28Civ6%29](Industrial Zones). However, unlike the Mine, you can't choose where you will place a Quarry.
As of the [Civilization%20VI%20June%202019%20Update](June 2019 Update), Quarries provide twice the adjacency bonus to Industrial Zones than Mines and [Lumber%20Mill%20%28Civ6%29](Lumber Mills) do, so keeping near your cities can provide an easy boost to your industrial capabilities.
Building a Quarry triggers the for [Masonry%20%28Civ6%29](Masonry).
