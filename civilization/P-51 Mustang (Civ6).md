As the only unique air unit, the P-51 Mustang allows the Americans to rest easy if a civilization with a strong air force tries to pick a fight with them. It receives a combat bonus against other air fighter units, on top of its superior Combat Strength compared to the standard Fighter. It also earns XP 50% faster, allowing it to quickly earn s that make it sturdier against anti-air units or more powerful against bomber units and land units. In addition, its superior flight range allows it to deploy farther away from [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities), effectively extending the maximum of the unit from the standard 13 [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles) to 15 tiles.
