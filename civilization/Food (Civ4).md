# Food (Civ4)

Food () is one of the three basic economic inputs found in "[Civilization%20IV](Civilization IV)". It is produced by [Tile%20%28Civ4%29](tiles) when they are [Worker%20%28Civ4%29](worked) by population in a [City%20%28Civ4%29](city). See the [Production%20%28Civ4%29](Production) article for more info.
For each unit of [Population%20%28Civ4%29](Population), two (2) units of food are consumed . For a city's population to remain stable, [Citizen%20%28Civ4%29](Citizens) must work [Tile%20%28Civ4%29](tiles) such that the total yield of Food is equal to the amount of food consumed .
If is "less" than , such that there is a negative net food yield , then the city will shrink, and its food reserves will be consumed. If all food reserves are consumed, then the city will enter Starvation, and the city will lose a unit of Population. If food reserves are reduced exactly to zero, there will be no Starvation, and no Population will be lost; population is lost only if the food reserves would drop to less than zero.
If is greater than , then the food bar will be filled; if it is totally filled, then the city's population will grow by one (1). If the city contains a [Granary%20%28Civ4%29](Granary), then the food bar will start at 50% after growth.
Terrain.
Food is produced inherently by all types of [Terrain%20%28Civ4%29](terrain) with these exceptions:
Tile Improvements.
Additional food may be generated by these [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ4%29](tile improvements):
Resources.
All [Resource%20%28Civ4%29%23Food%20Resources](food resources) ( Bananas, Clams, Corn, Cows, Crabs, Deer, Fish, Pigs, Rice, Sheep, and Wheat) generate food. These resources add +1 Food to their tile even before they are improved and some more when they are improved. The luxury resources [Sugar%20%28Civ4%29](Sugar) () and [Whale%20%28Civ4%29](Whales) () generate food without any improvements, as well. In addition, [Spices%20%28Civ4%29](Spices) () and [Wine%20%28Civ4%29](Wine) () generate food when improved.
