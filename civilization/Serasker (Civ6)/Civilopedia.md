# Serasker (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Serasker is the old Ottoman title for a vizier who commands an army. Only trusted viziers were given this responsibility, as the Sultan would then be enabling a potential rival with a considerable force to potentially overthrow him. This was one of the titles given to Ibrahim Pasha during his life.
