Great Library entry.
The Tundra, an inhospitable terrain for most creatures, is the perfect location for caribou. Unlike coniferous forests where Caribou can also be found, the tundra has wide open spaces that allow the animals to escape from their slower enemies, wolves. Caribou hides and meat are highly prized, but their antlers are their most distinctive and valuable component. Unlike deer, both male and female caribou grow antlers that are periodically shed. For centuries, native Indians have used antler for decorations, weaponry, and religious and medicinal purposes.
