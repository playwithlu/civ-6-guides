# Wars of Religion (Civ6)

Wars of Religion is a Military [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
If you're a warmonger who's managed to found a [Religion%20%28Civ6%29](religion), Wars of Religion will give your [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](units) an advantage in combat with followers of other religions. You can make optimal use of it when playing as a [Leaders%20%28Civ6%29](leader) who receives both religious and military bonuses, such as [Philip%20II%20%28Civ6%29](Philip II), [Chandragupta%20%28Civ6%29](Chandragupta), or [Tamar%20%28Civ6%29](Tamar).
Similar to a [Alliance%20%28Civ6%29](Military Alliance), the policy only works against units and not cities.
