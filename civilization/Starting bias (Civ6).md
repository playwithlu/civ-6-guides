# Starting bias (Civ6)

Some [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) have a starting bias, which affects the starting positions they get assigned on map generation. This is done so that each civilization can gain [Terrain%20%28Civ6%29](terrain) that best benefits their abilities, infrastructure, and [Unique%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](unique units). The bias is usually based on historical data.
Upon generation, the [Map%20%28Civ6%29](map) is split into equal parts for each civilization that is in the game. Each civ starts far enough from the others so that they have enough space to grow. The exception is with the [M%C4%81ori%20%28Civ6%29](MƒÅori), who do not get any land allocated to them. Civs' starting positions (that is, where their initial units are situated) will be distributed around the map according to their start biases. If a section has a lot of rainforest, it is likelier that [Brazilian%20%28Civ6%29](Brazil) will be placed there instead of [Arabian%20%28Civ6%29](Arabia). Start biases are ranked by tiers, with tier 1 being the strongest and tier 5 the weakest. It is not guaranteed that each section will directly correlate with a civ, as the map generates without taking into consideration which civs are in the game.
Some [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](City-states) have starting biases too:
