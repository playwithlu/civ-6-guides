Great Library entry.
Although the early Technocracy produced wondrous advances, it also produced a great amount of discontent in its citizens who complained bitterly about fading personal liberty. In order to quell this unhappiness, the government logically turned to technology - in the form of Mind Control. Prominent scientists developed neural implants that fed off of microwave transmissions and directly stimulated the pleasure/pain regions of the brain. In Project Happiness, the government implanted these chips into every person's brain, instantly transforming a grumbling people into a pleasantly stupefied workforce.
