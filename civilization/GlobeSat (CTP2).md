Great Library entry.
In the 1950s, as the United States and the Soviet Union expanded their espionage and surveillance efforts, both nations launched a series of rockets into space which deployed spy satellites. By 1960, the Corona, the first US surveillance satellite, successfully dropped a canister from orbit containing 3000 feet of exposed film. By the 1990s, spy satellites added extremely sensitive digital cameras and electronic listening equipment. When mobile satellites were deployed that could change orbital paths to avoid anti-satellite targeting, both nations possessed the capability to observe every square foot of the world, vastly increasing their snooping potential.
