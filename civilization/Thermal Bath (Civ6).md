Strategy.
The Thermal Bath is an interesting replacement for the standard [Zoo%20%28Civ6%29](Zoo), a rather underutilized building in an underwhelming and often neglected district. This building encourages the Hungarians to look for and settle near [Volcanoes%20%28Civ6%29](Volcanoes) where [Geothermal%20Fissure%20%28Civ6%29](Geothermal Fissures) are available (likely a simple task thanks to their sizable start bias towards this terrain feature). Under various conditions, the Thermal Bath supplies as many as or even twice as many as the [Stadium%20%28Civ6%29](Stadium) at only three quarters of the production cost, not to mention extra regional bonus and early , thus if you manage to settle near a Geothermal Fissure, you can easily make all of your cities within 6 tiles ecstatic without wasting 480 more on building a [Stadium%20%28Civ6%29](Stadium) for more .
Unlike the normal Zoo, the Thermal Bath does not grant +1 to [Marsh%20%28Civ6%29](Marsh) and [Rainforest%20%28Civ6%29](Rainforest) tiles in the city.
