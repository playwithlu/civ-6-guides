# Nuclear accident (Civ6)

A nuclear accident is a [Disasters%20%28Civ6%29](disaster) in "" that can occur in an [Industrial%20Zone%20%28Civ6%29](Industrial Zone) with a [Nuclear%20Power%20Plant%20%28Civ6%29](Nuclear Power Plant). It is the only man-made disaster featured in the game.
Mechanics.
Once built, a Nuclear Power Plant starts to age. The age of a Nuclear Power Plant (displayed in-game as Reactor Age when hovering over the [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) [Project%20%28Civ6%29](project) [Recommission%20Nuclear%20Reactor%20%28Civ6%29](Recommission Nuclear Reactor)) is defined as the number of turns that have passed since the Power Plant was first constructed, converted to, or last recommissioned.
As the Reactor Age increases, the likelihood of a nuclear accident increases, as does the potential severity of the accident.
Completing the city project Recommission Nuclear Reactor resets the Reactor Age to 0 (in the city with the aging Nuclear Power Plant).
There are three levels of accidents, each successively more severe and made possible by higher Reactor Age:
Any unit ending its turn on a tile with fallout will suffer 50 damage. A [Builder%20%28Civ6%29](Builder), [Military%20Engineer%20%28Civ6%29](Military Engineer), [Legion%20%28Civ6%29](Legion) or [Toa%20%28Civ6%29](Toa) can scrub the fallout.
Prior to the [Civilization%20VI%20April%202019%20Update](Antarctic Late Summer Update), a nuclear accident could be inadvertently triggered by pillaging the Nuclear Power Plant (either with a military unit, or by having a [Spy%20%28Civ6%29](Spy) carry out the [Espionage%20%28Civ6%29%23Espionage%20Missions](Sabotage Production) mission). Also, subsequent to this update, the Recommission Nuclear Reactor project will automatically repair a pillaged Nuclear Power Plant.
