# Interceptor (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Towards the end of World War I, as long-range bombing raids became more fearsome and frequent, several designers began building fighter planes specifically to prevent these; they termed them "interceptor aircraft." Between the wars, as it became obvious that everyone was going to bomb targets in each other's homelands (following the Italian Giulio Douhet's theories), there was a push to design interceptors; these designs took two forms: relatively lightweight and speedy fighters to hit the bombers aloof, and heavier and long-range fighters to operate in adverse weather and at night. During the Cold War, both the United States and Soviet Russia maintained entire wings of interceptors (not that they'd have done much good when the nukes were unleashed).
