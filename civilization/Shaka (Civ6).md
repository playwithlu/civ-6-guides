Intro.
 Clever Shaka, king of the Zulu, your soldiers shall win you an empire. The Impi warriors at your command outflank and outfight all who oppose them. The unyielding Zulu armies will prove your strength lies in numbers. You need not war with every neighbor—but let them think you might.
In-Game.
Shaka's unique [Agenda%20%28Civ6%29](agenda) is Horn, Chest, Loins. He tries to form as many [Unit%20%28Civ6%29%23Combining%20units](Corps and Armies) as possible, and dislikes civilizations who do not form their [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](units) into Corps and Armies.
His [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader ability) is Amabutho. He may form Corps with [Mercenaries%20%28Civ6%29](Mercenaries) and Armies with [Nationalism%20%28Civ6%29](Nationalism), and his Corps and Armies receive a +5 bonus to their base Combat Strength.
Detailed Approach.
Shaka's Corps and Armies are his true strength in warfare. In addition to building a strong military base, early development in his [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) will be important in unlocking the Mercenaries and Nationalism [Civic%20%28Civ6%29](civics), allowing him to start creating superior Corps and Armies of units far earlier and faster than any other civilization. Training the formidable [Impi%20%28Civ6%29](Impi) unit will also help in this endeavor, through their low production and maintenance costs. Gaining and maintaining [Loyalty%20%28Civ6%29](Loyalty) in conquered cities is less of a problem for the Zulu, a much needed skill for controlling their expansive empire.
