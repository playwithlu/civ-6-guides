Game Info.
Advanced bomber unit of the [Information%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Information Era). Upgrades from the [Bomber%20%28Civ5%29](Bomber). Requires .
Strategy.
The Stealth Bomber is the ultimate bomber unit, possessing huge range, a greater Ranged Combat Strength, and an additional ability to avoid enemy fighters and anti-aircraft defenses, thanks to its next-gen radar-avoiding technology. As if that weren't enough, it has the Air Recon ability, which means that everything within 6 tiles of its starting location is visible at the beginning of the turn.
On the downside, Stealth Bombers cannot be transported aboard [Carrier%20%28Civ5%29](Carriers). Fortunately, their rebase range of 40 tiles is often large enough that they can fly over oceans, as long as you possess a [City%20%28Civ5%29](city) on the other side of it.
