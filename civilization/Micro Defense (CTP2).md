The Micro Defense helped counter the emerging threat of biological and nanotechnological warfare attacks on cities. To combat the silent, invisible attacks perpetuated by s, and to help prevent future applications of nano-warfare, nanotechnology experts hastily modified prototypical nanite air purifiers to handle nano-warfare. Using nanites to monitor the air in and around a city, the micro defense could locate and isolate both biological and nanotechnological weapons and neutralize them. Micro Defense nanites were also specially designed to replicate themselves and evolve to combat new strains of pathogens should they be released.
