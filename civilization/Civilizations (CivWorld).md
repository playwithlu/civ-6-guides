# Civilizations (CivWorld)

By default, new players are not members of any civilization, and start out as independent [Nation%20%28CivWorld%29](Nations). In "[CivWorld](CivWorld)", there are 16 civilizations available to the players:
The civilizations are the major competitors in the game, each of which can comprise more than one Nation (player). Once a player has founded a civilization, any other player can join it. For game balance reasons, the maximum number of players in a given civilization cannot be higher than 20% of total players in the game. If a civilization is full, you need to find another one to join.
Independent players cannot be attacked, but they also cannot unlock most of the [Achievements%20%28CivWorld%29](achievements) nor have access to [Civic%20%28CivWorld%29](Civics) and [Wonder%20%28CivWorld%29](Wonders). A player can leave a civilization and become independent again, free to join another one.
