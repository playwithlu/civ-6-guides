Leader's defining quote.
"Risks of Flowering: considerable. But rewards of godhood: who can measure?"
-- Usurper Judaa Marr, "Courage : To Question"
Background.
Judaa Marr was the commander of the Usurper scout ship locked in battle with its Caretaker counterpart above [Chiron](Chiron) moments before their near-fatal collision and subsequent crash-landing on Planet's surface via escape pod. Not only is Judaa shocked and disturbed by both the hostile native activity and the presence of offworlders that exacerbate it, but his hated rival, Conservator Lular H'minee of the Caretakers, is alive and well with her minions on Planet's surface.
Personality.
Though Human data on Judaa Marr is limited at best, it is confirmed that "he" (actual sex is unknown; gender and gender roles are a fluid, superficial concept in Progenitor culture) is a cruel, manipulative, power-hungry individual that is held in both cult-like reverence and deeply-rooted terror by his very own followers. Like the rest of the Progenitor race, Judaa is largely apathetic of mankind, seeing them as inferior beings as evidenced by their social experiments on Humans and gruesome reconstitution of them as food after destroying a Human base. There are even accusations of him feasting on living Human prisoners, adding to his tyrannical reputation. And like the rest of those who follow the Usurper ideology, Judaa Marr is hell-bent on exploiting the power of the Six Manifolds to achieve transcendence to aid him in his pursuit of galactic conquest.
