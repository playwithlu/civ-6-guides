# Rainforest (Civ6)

Rainforests (sometimes called Jungles) are a [Terrain%20%28Civ6%29%23Features](terrain feature) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". Rainforests appear on [Plains%20%28Civ6%29](Plains) and [Plains%20%28Hills%29%20%28Civ6%29](Plains Hills) [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles) near the equator of the [Map%20%28Civ6%29](map), often in thick belts which form an impenetrable barrier.
In "" can also spawn on Rainforests.
Strategy.
Rainforests provide growth and protection for [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) living within them, and provide adjacency bonuses to Campuses due to their rich biodiversity. They also house many useful [Resource%20%28Civ6%29](resources), such as and . Note that in "Civilization VI" you do not need to cut down the Rainforest to access resources in it!
Both [Brazilian%20%28Civ6%29](Brazil) and [Kongolese%20%28Civ6%29](Kongo) especially benefit from cities near Rainforests due to their unique traits.
Originally, it was not possible to improve Rainforests. The [Civilization%20VI%20June%202019%20Update](June 2019 Update) allowed [Lumber%20Mill%20%28Civ6%29](Lumber Mill) improvements to be built on Rainforest tiles after discovering the [Mercantilism%20%28Civ6%29](Mercantilism) [Civic%20%28Civ6%29](civic), greatly increasing their output.
Large patches of Rainforest can be chopped to force a city to grow, which is especially useful if the city was already at its cap. The larger Population may also enable the city to build more districts. The player needs to strike a balance between the short term and growth benefit of removing the Rainforest versus the potential of a mid-game Lumber Mill. Note that removing features will anger any [Leaders%20%28Civ6%29](leaders) you've met that follow the Environmentalist [Agenda%20%28Civ6%29](agenda).
The main drawback of Rainforests is that they decrease Appeal (unlike [Woods%20%28Civ6%29](Woods)), making them unsuitable for [Neighborhood%20%28Civ6%29](Neighborhoods) or tourist attractions. They also differ from Woods in that they cannot be replanted once removed.
