# Hanging Gardens (Civ4)

Strategy.
The Hanging Gardens improves the health of your [City%20%28Civ4%29](cities) and adds an additional [Population%20%28Civ4%29](population) point in them. It increases the odds of its city generating a [Great%20Engineer%20%28Civ4%29](Great Engineer).
The more cities you have, the bigger the bonus. Team games will have a very large bonus, as the wonder affects a whole team. [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ4](Civilizations) founded around jungles will notice the greatest impact (as this wonder counteracts the poor growth without adding more unhealthiness).
