# Luboric (Civ5)/Civilopedia

Appearing in the natural world as a nondescript, dull green ore, luboric glows under high temperatures. It is much more powerful and volatile than its predecessor, coal, and acts as the ultimate energy source for factories and vehicles alike. The chain of reactions and mechanisms required to utilize luboric are complex and unprecedented in the science of energies. Whereas most fuel sources yield their energy when burned, luboric is unfazed by flame, its green glow the only apparent reaction. To unlock the enormous potential present within chunks of luboric ore, it must be submerged in a solution of enzymes and subjected to both heat and pressure. The key reaction is not combustion, but dissolution. Its toxic gaseous exhaust must be carefully guided; if the fumes get trapped in a valve or corner for more than a few seconds it will eat through metal. Only with precautions will its legendary energy be loosed from its chemical bonds.
