# Twilight Veil (Civ6)/Civilopedia

When facing a larger foe, there's no shame in using the tools of deception and misdirection to overwhelm them. Perhaps a little shame, but once you've defeated your foe, who will be left to tell the tale?
The Twilight Veil is one such technique, using concealment to circumvent an opponent's awareness. If they can't see you, they can't hit you. But beware: it's easy to get lost in the shadows.
