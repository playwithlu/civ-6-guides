# Chariot (Civ4)

The Chariot is replaced by the following [Unique%20unit%20%28Civ4%29](unique units):
The Chariot can upgrade to either a Horse Archer or a Knight in Vanilla and Warlords, but can only upgrade to a Knight in Beyond the Sword.
Strategy.
Build this most primitive of the mounted combat units when speed is important, but stay on the offensive as it gets no defensive bonuses.
Chariots are particularly effective against [Axeman%20%28Civ4%29](Axemen), against whom they receive a big attack bonus, but are vulnerable to [Spearman%20%28Civ4%29](Spearmen) and [Pikeman%20%28Civ4%29](Pikemen).
