The development of Writing meant that the accumulated knowledge of a society no longer needed to be memorized and passed along orally. It could be written down, stored, and consulted later. This made possible a great body of knowledge in written texts that could be transferred throughout the world. The storehouse for the accumulated texts was called a Library, after the Latin word liber, meaning book. The great Libraries of the ancient world, especially the ones at Alexandria and Pergamum, became leading centers of science and scholarship. The librarians actively collected the books of the world, accelerating the spread of new knowledge.
