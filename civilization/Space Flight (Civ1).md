Civilopedia entry.
Following the development of the first guided missiles in World War II, the science of Rocketry advanced to the point where direct space exploration became possible. Space Flight advanced from simple sub-orbital flights to manned missions to the Moon. Work continues today on building space stations and reusable space vehicles. In the near future there may be a manned mission to Mars. In succeeding generations, new advances may make manned travel to other star systems practical.
