Great Library entry.
Cryonics is the science of freezing living tissue for indeterminate periods before bringing that tissue back to life. In the mid 22nd century, Cryonics at last fulfilled its promise of safe resuscitation. Surprisingly, this impacted religion more than any other field as the faithful flocked to cryonics labs. These believers sought desperately to "cross over," and be reborn. In an aside, this brought a temporary end to the age-old obsession with space aliens.
