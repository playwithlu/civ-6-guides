# City Walls (Civ2)

 City Walls are [List%20of%20buildings%20in%20Civ2](buildings) in "[Civilization%20II](Civilization II)" that grant defending units a 3x bonus vs ground attacks. Additionally, cities with walls do not suffer any loss when defending units are defeated by ground units that are affected by walls.
Civilopedia entry.
Before the establishment of centralized governments capable of supporting strong, national armies, individual cities were left to fend for themselves when it came to defense. As a result, many cities constructed city walls to protect against raiders and bandits. City walls represented a major investment in both time and materials, requiring years to complete and constant repairs to maintain their strength and integrity. However, these walls turned the city into a fortress capable of withstanding all but the most determined attack.
