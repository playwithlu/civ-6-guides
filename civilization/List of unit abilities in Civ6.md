# List of unit abilities in Civ6

Unit abilities are [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](unit) traits that are gained passively or by an additional condition. Although somewhat similar to {{Promotion6}}s, they are not earned by gaining [XP](XP) or through [Technology%20%28Civ6%29](technological) research (for [Giant%20Death%20Robot%20%28Civ6%29](Giant Death Robots)).
There are also unit combat modifiers, which are covered in detail on the [Combat%20%28Civ6%29](combat) page. They have additional impact on the combat strength of the units based on the circumstances under which combat occurs (e.g. ideal/unfavorable [Terrain%20%28Civ6%29](terrain), [Flanking%20and%20Support%20%28Civ6%29](flanking/support bonuses), fortification, unit damage, {{Alliance6}} bonuses). These modifiers are not listed on this page.
