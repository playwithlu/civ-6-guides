# Cardiff (Civ6)

Cardiff is an industrial [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-state) in "".
Strategy.
Cardiff is very different from other city-states, since its bonus is completely meaningless pre-[Industrial%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Industrial Era) but becomes immensely useful once [Buildings%20%28Civ6%29](buildings) that require are unlocked. If you are a maritime civilization with many [Coastal%20%28Civ6%29](coastal) [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities), this is the city-state to aim for when the Industrial Era rolls around since coastal cities do not have a lot of land for -generating [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](tile improvements) before the [Offshore%20Wind%20Farm%20%28Civ6%29](Offshore Wind Farm) is accessible and the [Harbor%20%28Civ6%29](Harbor) district is almost a must-build for these cities. Surprisingly, the [Biosph%C3%A8re%20%28Civ6%29](Biosphère) wonder will also apply to Harbors, giving you even more and .
A fully built Harbor with Suzerainty of Cardiff will grant its city 6 , which is equal to a [Hydroelectric%20Dam%20%28Civ6%29](Hydroelectric Dam) and superior to the 4 an [Oil%20Power%20Plant%20%28Civ6%29](Oil) or [Coal%20Power%20Plant%20%28Civ6%29](Coal Power Plant) will grant a city (although the latter may still want to be built for reasons other than ), but is inferior to the 16 a [Nuclear%20Power%20Plant%20%28Civ6%29](Nuclear Power Plant) gives. However, if you have the aforementioned Biosphère, harbor buildings will then provide 6 instead of 2, for a total of 18 from a fully developed Harbor.
