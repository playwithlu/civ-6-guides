# Assassin (Civ3)/Civilopedia

While there are as many different types of assassins as there are ways to kill people -- assassination being murder
for hire -- the term ‘assassin’ comes from a secret Muslim sect, founded by Hassan ben Sabbah in the 11th century.
This sect was a militant group of the Nizari branch of Ismaeli Muslims, which believed in the murder of its enemies
as a religious duty. These militants were called hashshashin, an Arabic word meaning ‘hashish-eaters,’ because the
members were thought to be under the influence of that drug when they went on their missions. The sect flourished in
Syria and Persia, and eventually spread over much of the Middle East, until the Mongols and Mamelukes subdued it during
the 13th century. Other famous assassin groups were the ninjas of Japan and the Thuggee cult of India.
