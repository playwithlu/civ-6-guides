# Inquisitor (Civ3)/Civilopedia

An Inquisitor is a representative of the Holy Inquisition, the papal office charged with 
ferreting out and eliminating heresy and doctrinal errors. Contrary to popular impression, 
medieval inquisitors had fairly limited powers, although in practice there were few checks on 
their authority. However, one major difference between inquisitors and other ecclesiastical (and 
secular) enforcement officers was that inquisitors had very broad discretion about what lines of 
inquiry to pursue. Inquisitors were permitted to use torture in interrogation in 1251 C.E., about 
thirty years after the initial Inquisition was created.
