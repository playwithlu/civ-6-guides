# Taj Mahal (Civ4)

Strategy.
Building the Taj Mahal begins an immediate [Golden%20Age%20%28Civ4%29](Golden Age) for your [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ4](civilization). It increases its [City%20%28Civ4%29](city's) odds of generating a [Great%20Artist%20%28Civ4%29](Great Artist).
This wonder is fairly powerful if you also have the [Mausoleum%20of%20Maussollos%20%28Civ4%29](Mausoleum of Maussollos).
