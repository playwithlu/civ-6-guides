The term "flak" was an abbreviated name for Fliegerabwehrkanone, the 88-millimeter German-made antiaircraft cannon that was the bane of allied bombers in World War II. While most rapid-firing antiaircraft guns employed much smaller shells, like the 40-millimeter "Bofors guns" preferred by Allied forces against dive-bombers and low-flying aircraft. Flak cannons, some up to 120 mm, were particularly effective against high-flying, slow-moving bombers. The shells, fired up to 2 miles in the air at rates as high as 120 rounds a minute, used radio-waved proximity fuses that would explode within a certain range of the target. Despite continued developments in the early 1950s, flak cannons and other heavy antiaircraft guns were eventually replaced by surface-to-air missiles in the late 1950s and early '60s.
