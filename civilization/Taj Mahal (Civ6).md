# Taj Mahal (Civ6)

The Taj Mahal is a in "". It must be built along a [River%20%28Civ6%29](River).
Strategy.
The Taj Mahal increases the value of Historic Moments its owner triggers, making it easier for him or her to maintain [Golden%20Age%20%28Civ6%29](Golden Ages) as they advance through the [Era%20%28Civ6%29](eras). [Georgian%20%28Civ6%29](Georgia's) bonuses to Golden Ages make this a wonder they'll want to build, and they or any other [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) that builds it can benefit greatly from choosing Heartbeat of Steam or To Arms! as a Dedication, since both of these provide opportunities to earn +2 Era Score bonuses.
This wonder becomes far more significant if playing with [Dramatic%20Ages%20%28Civ6%29](Dramatic Ages), since the only Ages are Golden or [Dark%20Age%20%28Civ6%29](Dark). Having bonus Era Score to help reach Golden Age levels can be an extremely important part of game strategy.
