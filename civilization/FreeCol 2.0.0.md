# FreeCol 2.0.0

[FreeCol](FreeCol) 2.0.0 is the tentative name for a [FreeCol%20versions](FreeCol version) to be what FreeCol users and designers think a [Sid%20Meier](Sid Meier) "Colonization II" should have been like. Now that [Sid](Sid) has been involved in something very like that, FreeCol can do better. According to [https%3A//sourceforge.net/forum/message.php%3Fmsg_id%3D6477438](at least one reviewer), it already has done better.
We can use forum pages here to discuss the idea. Give them names starting with "Forum:FreeCol 2:" so that they are easier to keep track of.
