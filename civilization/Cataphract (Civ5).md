Strategy.
The Cataphract is the most heavily-armored mounted unit at this stage of the game, and is much stronger (+3) than the normal Horseman. Its special abilities make it even more formidable: defensively it can use [Terrain%20%28Civ5%29](terrain) bonuses, unlike other mounted units, and against [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities) it only has a 25% penalty instead of the standard 33 percent. Its only drawback is that it moves a bit slower.
The Cataphract loses all its advantages when upgraded to a [Knight%20%28Civ5%29](Knight), so make sure to use the unit well in the early game.
