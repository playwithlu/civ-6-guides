# Camp (Civ4)

A Camp is a [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ4%29](tile improvement) that can be built upon the discovery of [Hunting%20%28Civ4%29](Hunting). It improves sources of [Deer%20%28Civ4%29](Deer), [Furs%20%28Civ4%29](Furs), and [Ivory%20%28Civ4%29](Ivory). Unlike most improvements, the camp does not need to clear forests.
