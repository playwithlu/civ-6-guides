# Portuguese (Civ5)

The Portuguese people represent a [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilization) in "".
Strategy.
The Portuguese are one of the dominant trading nations in the game, oriented towards sea trade. Throughout the game, their [Trade%20route%20%28Civ5%29](Trade Routes) produce double the revenue from [Resources%20%28Civ5%29](resource) diversity. As if this weren't enough, their [Unique%20unit%20%28Civ5%29](unique naval unit), the [Nau%20%28Civ5%29](Nau), is able to conduct special trade missions that provide one-time boosts, in addition to an [XP](XP) bonus. What's more, thanks to their [Unique%20improvement%20%28Civ5%29](unique improvement), the [Feitoria%20%28Civ5%29](Feitoria), they can gain access to almost all luxuries "without" having to trade for them, thus leaving more and resources for other sorts of trading deals!
Because their main power comes from [City-state%20%28Civ5%29](city-states), Portugal should be concerned primarily with them, which points towards a [Diplomatic%20victory%20%28Civ5%29](diplomatic victory). Develop the Portuguese as a seafaring civilization while developing the [Patronage%20%28Civ5%29](Patronage) policy tree, try to rush [Astronomy%20%28Civ5%29](Astronomy), and start producing Naus ASAP. Then explore the world while trading, and send out [Worker%20%28Civ5%29](Workers) to build Feitorias in all city-states you consider to be strategic for you.
