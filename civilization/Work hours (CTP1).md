The workday has varied greatly through history. In ancient times, most citizens worked from dawn to dusk. The Industrial Revolution and the rise of interior lighting only expanded these hours. In the 19th Century, factory workers toiled twelve to sixteen hours a day packed elbow to elbow in slavish conditions. Only the rise of the worker's movement in the late 19th and 20th century ended such brutality.
