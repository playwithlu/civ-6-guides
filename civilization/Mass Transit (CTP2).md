Mass Transit is designed to move large numbers of people in and around cities, suburbs and large metropolitan areas. As modern urban planning efforts began to separate urban areas into industrial, commercial and residential areas, planners developed complex public transit systems to enable people to cheaply and efficiently move between their homes and workplaces.
Originally privately owned and operated, mass transit systems became more complex and expensive to operate, prompting many city and county governments to take over. There are two basic kinds of mass transit: fixed- and nonfixed-route. Fixed-route usually involves rail and trolley systems in below surface, surface and above-surface modes. Nonfixed-route refers to travel on streets and highways. Some systems utilize ferries, boats, hydroplanes and even hovercrafts where geography and commuter need demands it.
