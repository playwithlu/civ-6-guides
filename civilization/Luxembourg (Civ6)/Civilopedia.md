# Luxembourg (Civ6)/Civilopedia

The tiny principality of Luxembourg lies between France and Germany, and moreover is the center of a major rail junction between the countries. Capture of these railyards was critical for the German plan to invade France, and consequently the invasion of Luxembourg was one of the first actions of the war in 1914.
