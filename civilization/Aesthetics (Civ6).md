# Aesthetics (Civ6)

Aesthetics is an Economic [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
Aesthetics is the next Economic Policy that enhances [Adjacency%20bonus%20%28Civ6%29](adjacency bonuses), this time for the [Theater%20Square%20%28Civ6%29](Theater Square). However, getting adjacency bonuses for this {{District6}} is most problematic of all districts - only [Wonder%20%28Civ6%29](wonders) provide a standard bonus, while other nearby districts provide the usual minor bonus. As a result, your Theater Squares will have few or no bonuses unless you manage to surround them with other districts and/or build lots of wonders.
In light of this, Aesthetics becomes usually outclassed since another policy ([Meritocracy%20%28Civ6%29](Meritocracy)) can potentially provide an equal or much better {{Culture6}} bonus. The only case in which you will be able to make good use of Aesthetics is if you build many wonders, and manage to place them around your Theater Squares in such a way as for them to have adjacency bonuses of more than 2.
Alternatively, [Japanese%20%28Civ6%29](Japan) and [Greek%20%28Civ6%29](Greece) can make wonderful use of Aesthetics due to their bonuses to Theater Square/[Acropolis%20%28Civ6%29](Acropolis) adjacency giving them consistently high yields. [Ludwig%20II%20%28Civ6%29](Ludwig II's) [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader ability) also allows him to leverage this policy for early {{Tourism6}} after researching [Castles%20%28Civ6%29](Castles).
