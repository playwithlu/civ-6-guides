# Plantation (Civ5)

Game Info.
Advanced agricultural improvement. Requires [Calendar%20%28Civ5%29](Calendar).
Strategy.
Plantations allow your empire to make use of a wide variety of luxury resources. They can also be used to improve resources, but this isn't worth the trouble on many occasions. Even though a Plantation gives +2 , building one requires your [Worker%20%28Civ5%29](Workers) to cut down the [Jungle%20%28Civ5%29](jungle) first. As jungle itself provides 1 and 1 , and the Plantation loses 1 , building a Plantation nets only +1 , or +1 on a hill. At the same time, you will lose the 2 potential from the jungle, so consider carefully whether getting 1 extra from the tile or 2 from the native jungle is more important to you.
You should also keep in mind that if you have Oral Tradition, you "will" have to cut down the jungle to gain the bonus .
