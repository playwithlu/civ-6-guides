# American G.I. (Civ3)/Civilopedia

The American "GI" (for "General Infantry") was probably the best equipped, if not the best trained, soldier
of WWII. His rapid-firing M1 Garand, as well as a plethora of automatic weapons -- along with an ample supply of
ammunition -- meant that the firepower of the U.S. infantryman was seldom equaled. This high firepower was
especially felt by the Nipponese infantryman, who was typically equipped with a
slower-firing bolt-action rifle and less automatic weapons. Unlike his Japanese counterpart, however, the
American soldier was not as well trained in night fighting, nor for living in the jungle.
