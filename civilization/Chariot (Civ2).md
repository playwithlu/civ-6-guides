# Chariot (Civ2)

The Chariot is a ground unit in [Civilization%20II](Civilization II).
Civilopedia entry.
The chariot was the first true fighting vehicle. It was used by ancient armies to transport archers and other troops to the battlefield, where they would disembark and fight. The chariot was turned into a fearsome offensive weapon by the Assyrians, whose archers and spearmen fought from inside the chariot itself. Few enemies were able to withstand an onslaught of Assyrian chariots. This devastating form of attack was soon adopted by many of the Assyrian's enemies, who used the chariot against them with good effect.
