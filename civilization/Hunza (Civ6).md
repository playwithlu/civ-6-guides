Strategy.
The usefulness of Hunza's [Suzerain%20%28Civ6%29](Suzerain) bonus varies over time. In the early game, you want your s to be short so that you can quickly create [Roads%20%28Civ6%29](Roads) and establish s, so it's not worth going out of your way to become the Suzerain of Hunza. A land can reach a maximum distance of 15 [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles), resulting in a mere +3 at the cost of flexibility, as it will take a much longer time to finish. A sea isn't impossible, but a very rare sight before researching [Cartography%20%28Civ6%29](Cartography). In the late game, a dense network of s will allow you to establish long s across oceans and [Continent%20%28Civ6%29](continents) and bring in a lot of extra . However, there are several other ways to easily earn late in the game, making Hunza a somewhat underwhelming city-state. That being said, if you have to choose between Hunza, [Bandar%20Brunei%20%28Civ6%29](Bandar Brunei), and [Venice%20%28Civ6%29](Venice) ([Amsterdam%20%28Civ6%29](Amsterdam) under some rulesets), Hunza is the best choice - you can actively try to maximize the amount of you receive from its bonus.
