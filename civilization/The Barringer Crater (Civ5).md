# The Barringer Crater (Civ5)

The Barringer Crater is a [Natural%20wonder%20%28Civ5%29](natural wonder) in "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)". It spawns in [Desert%20%28Civ5%29](desert), [Tundra%20%28Civ5%29](tundra), and [Mountain%20%28Civ5%29](mountain) tiles.
Strategy.
The Barringer Crater is one of only four natural wonders which provide aÂ  bonus, and that makes it quite desirable in the early game. Try to settle a [City%20%28Civ5%29](city) nearby ASAP to make full use of the bonus while it means something.
