Great Library entry.
In Asia Minor during the 2nd millennium BC, wrought iron began to replace bronze in tools and weaponry. By the 3rd century BC, it was a well-established material in China, India and much of the Mediterranean. Iron's dominance was due in large part to its availability. Whereas bronze required both copper and tin, both of which were scarce, iron was an abundant natural resource. Wrought iron and, later cast iron, was a principle material for both peace and war for many centuries.
