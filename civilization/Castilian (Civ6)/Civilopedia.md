# Castilian (Civ6)/Civilopedia

The region of Castile occupies much of the central area of todayâ€™s nation of Spain. During the Medieval Age, the kingdom was usually at war with the Muslim regions in southern Spain. The unification of the crowns of Castile and the neighboring kingdom of Leon would set the stage for Castile to become the dominant power in the Iberian Peninsula.
