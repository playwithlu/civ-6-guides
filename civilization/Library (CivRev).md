Civilopedia entry.
A library is a building where written materials - tablets, scrolls, books, etc. - are collected for public or private use. Before the invention of the printing press books were rare, precious items, each individual copy requiring hundreds of hours of painstaking labor to create. Only the wealthiest cities could afford a library, and those that had them had a significant technological and cultural advantage over cities that did not.
