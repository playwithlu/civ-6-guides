# Valletta (Civ6)

Valletta is a militaristic [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-state) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
Valletta is one of the more game-changing city-states. It allows to be used for expansion, defense, and production if mere spreading of one's [Religion%20%28Civ6%29](religion) is not the most pressing goal. Strong generation and [Suzerain%20%28Civ6%29](Suzerain) status with Valletta allows every new or undeveloped [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) to get up and running at ridiculous speed, fueling expansion without weak spots in defense.
The rate of exchange when purchasing [Building%20%28Civ6%29](buildings) is 2 for 1 . It's fairly easy to generate more than , and it is "in addition" to rather than instead of it. Not having to spend on the [Granary%20%28Civ6%29](Granary), [Water%20Mill%20%28Civ6%29](Water Mill), and [Monument%20%28Civ6%29](Monument) means you'll be able to build [Holy%20Site%20%28Civ6%29](Holy Sites) and their buildings faster, though you'll have to postpone purchasing [Missionary%20%28Civ6%29](Missionaries) and [Apostle%20%28Civ6%29](Apostles) until your empire's generation is higher.
Suzerainty of Valletta also allows you to purchase [Walls%20%28Civ6%29](Walls) with . When undefended cities are being attacked by [Barbarian%20%28Civ6%29](Barbarians) or enemy [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](units), being able to protect them with Walls instantaneously is a great advantage. [Encampment%20%28Civ6%29](Encampment) buildings, too, can be bought with . The [Barracks%20%28Civ6%29](Barracks), [Stable%20%28Civ6%29](Stable), [Armory%20%28Civ6%29](Armory), and [Military%20Academy%20%28Civ6%29](Military Academy) all provide additional and/or , so being Valletta's Suzerain can be invaluable for quickly ramping up the potential and Population limit of your cities.
[Georgian%20%28Civ6%29](Georgia) has strong synergy with Valletta thanks to the [Tsikhe%20%28Civ6%29](Tsikhe). By the time they unlock it with [Siege%20Tactics%20%28Civ6%29](Siege Tactics), they'll most likely have founded a religion and have strong generation. Even if they've previously neglected Walls, they can easily use to purchase [Ancient%20Walls%20%28Civ6%29](Ancient) and [Medieval%20Walls%20%28Civ6%29](Medieval Walls), then move on to the Tsikhe to turn their cities into impenetrable fortresses. Moreover, the Tsikhe will essentially pay for itself if built this way thanks to its innate generation...and it goes without saying that [Tamar%20%28Civ6%29](Tamar's) ability to generate twice as many s in cities following Georgia's religion will help her gain Suzerainty of Valletta with ease.
Finally, [Flood%20Barrier%20%28Civ6%29](Flood Barriers) are also available for purchase via Valletta in "". If you purchase them before your [Coastal%20%28Civ6%29](coastal) [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles) are submerged by [Flood%20%28Civ6%29%23Coastal%20floods](floods), your empire will be able to ignore some of the worst effects of [Climate%20%28Civ6%29%23Phases%20of%20Climate%20Change](climate change).
