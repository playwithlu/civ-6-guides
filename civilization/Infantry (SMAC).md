Game info.
Infantry units move slowly but are inexpensive and have important advantages in battle. Infantry units gain a +25% combat advantage when attacking enemy bases directly.
Names for infantry combat units might include:
And, of course, infantry of any type might be known simply as Infantry.
Noncombat units using the Infantry chassis include the default Formers (infantry chassis, [Terraforming%20Module%20%28SMAC%29](terraforming module), and fission reactors), Supply Crawlers (the default supply unit, which has a Fission Reactor, the Supply module, and an Infantry chassis; if the above chassis and module is used even with a more advanced reactor, the unit is merely known as "Supply"; this is rarely seen, as the more advanced reactors make supply vehicles with more mobile chasses more cost-effective), and the initial Colony Pod (using the infantry chassis and Fission Reactor).
