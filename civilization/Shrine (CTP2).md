Great Library entry.
Shrines had as many forms and functions as the religions that employed them. They also were referred to by many different names: Church, Synagogue, Temple, and Mosques. Depending on the faith, shrines functioned as places to worship in groups or alone, house relics or mark a spiritually significant location. Some shrines were simple structures, little more than a roof over sacred relics and prayer flags. Others were elaborate monuments, like the pyramids of Egypt, which served primarily to house the tombs of kings. Often, religious centers were the center of a town or region, and often represented the zenith of a culture's craftsmanship and architectural skill.
