# Planetary Survey (CivBE)

Game Information.
Planetary Survey is a Tier 0 [Secondary%20Tech%20%28CivBE%29](Secondary Tech) that can be researched from [Habitation%20%28CivBE%29](Habitation).
Planetary Survey gives the final brush in the initial adaptation to the new world. It establishes a reliable GPS system, together with a set of additional orientation techniques which grant land units mastery of the seas of the new planet. They gain the Embarkation ability, allowing them to cross water, and the [Worker%20%28CivBE%29](Worker unit) gains the ability to construct the [Work%20Barge%20%28CivBE%29](Work Barge) on water resources. 
There is no affinity linked to this technology
"Rising Tide".
In the "Beyond Earth" expansion, "Rising Tide", units automatically have the embarkation ability. Instead, planetary survey allows for [City%20%28CivBE%29](floating cities) to move from coastal tiles to deep ocean tiles.
