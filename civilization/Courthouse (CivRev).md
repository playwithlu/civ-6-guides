Civilopedia entry.
Courthouses are buildings where appointed officials rule on legal issues and mete out justice to the citizenry. The rule of law is one of the cornerstones of civilization. Societies can only advance when the weak are protected from the strong and brute force no longer reigns. In the 1700s BC the Babylonian king Hammurabi created one of the earliest systems of law in human history; although flawed by modern legal standards, the "Code of Hammurabi" is widely regarded as one of the great triumphs of civilization over barbarism.
