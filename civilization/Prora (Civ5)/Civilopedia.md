# Prora (Civ5)/Civilopedia

Built between 1936 and 1939, Prora was to be a massive beach resort on the Baltic island of Ruegen. The massive megalomaniac complex was intended to provide vacations for German workers. As originally planned, the Prora Resort would consist of eight blocks of ten housing units, capable of providing rooms for 20,000 vacationers. The complex, if completed, would also have included restaurants, cinemas, swimming pools, gymnasiums, ballrooms and other amenities, all served by a rail station and a quay for cruise ships. The outbreak of World War II halted construction; during the war the buildings were used to house refugees and later served as a military hospital. After the war, the complex was occupied by Soviet units for a period, and then stripped of all useable materials, down to the wiring and plumbing. Aside from a museum for East German history, most of the complex has fallen to decay.
