# Modding (Civ6)/List of Popular Gameplay Mods

These are mods that add new gameplay mechanics or heavily edit the current ones to the point of making them completely different. Gameplay mechanics can include absolutely anything that could be considered a part of the game that the player needs to interact with.
Non-gameplay mods.
While not adding any gameplay content, these mods are not purely aesthetic and cannot be deactivated without breaking saved games.
