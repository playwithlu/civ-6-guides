# Manipulation (C-evo)/Top four

The combination of [C-evo](C-evo)'s first four manipulations produces an interesting short game, generally between 20 and 40 turns. 
Basics.
Nations need to access all three rare minerals and build with them (or capture suitable {{LinkC-evo|Space Port}}s) while fending off powerful {{LinkC-evo|unit}}s produced by rivals using {{LinkC-evo|future technologies}}. Build many cities because each can produce a military or civil unit or {{LinkC-evo|building}}, and grow, each turn. Your computer-driven opponents seem to be unaware of that.
First three turns.
Then you go for a {{LinkC-evo|Revolution}} (and if you switch to {{LinkC-evo|Fundamentalism}} you have no {{LinkC-evo|morale}} or {{LinkC-evo|unit-support}} problems while the slower {{LinkC-evo|research}} is irrelevant) while the transition can affect only one city - but you may find that another Engineer is built and a third is ordered but delayed.
Later.
Early Engineers should move away (preferably on passenger planes) for just one or two turns then build new cities.
Research.
First research a basic {{LinkC-evo|ground unit}} (e.g. 204/204/1.5 {{LinkC-evo|Fanatic}} with {{LinkC-evo|Artillery}}) and a minimally-armed but long-range passenger plane (e.g. 0/51/12.5x4, carrying one unit) and identically-numbered {{LinkC-evo|spy plane}}. 
Then go for {{LinkC-evo|Artificial Intelligence}} so that you can build strong {{LinkC-evo|bomber}}s (with one or more spare {{LinkC-evo|fuel tank}}s, depending on topography) as soon as threatened: level 10 should handle most enemy {{LinkC-evo|marines}}, {{LinkC-evo|missile launcher}}s, and early ships, but go to higher levels unless enemies are close in case enemies develop much stronger units.
Buildings.
Ideally build a Military Academy, in a city that's not the closest to the {{LinkC-evo|Arctic}} or Antarctic, before building {{LinkC-evo|army unit}}s. Just before or while designing your first bombers, build airports in cities that are closest to enemies.
City growth.
Don't be too worried by warnings of {{LinkC-evo|starvation}}, because the city growth usually neutralizes it. In fact, if you are building an {{LinkC-evo|Army of Slaves}} or a {{LinkC-evo|spaceship}} part, the starvation seems to be ignored. Minimize starvation by building Algae Plant, Supermarket, and Harbor.
The only value in letting a city grow is to build engineers or an army of slaves.
If any city reaches size 7, you could be prudent to build an Aqueduct so as not to waste the chance of growth next turn, but an Engineer might be of more value. Similarly at size 11, a Sewer System or an Engineer.
Wonders.
Build {{LinkC-evo|Eiffel Tower}} early if you think you may be able to use {{LinkC-evo|Lighthouse}} or {{LinkC-evo|Hanging Gardens}} or {{LinkC-evo|Sun Tzu}}.
Game reports.
Several games have been the subject of reports, with a wide range of {{LinkC-evo|map}} sizes and {{LinkC-evo|land}} percentages.
