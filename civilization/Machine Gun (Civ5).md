Strategy.
The Machine Gun is the next-level ranged weapon of modern warfare, with design improvements over the earlier Gatling Gun which allow it to launch heavier bullets at a greater speed. The result is double the strength of the earlier weapon, but still with a one-[hex](hex) range only. Put Machine Guns in your [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities) for defense, or use them on the front lines in strategic positions for additional firepower.
