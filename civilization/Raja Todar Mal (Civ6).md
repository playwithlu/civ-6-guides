Strategy.
If you're a warmonger or an isolationist, most of your s are likely to be internal. This is when Raja Todar Mal is most useful: after activating him, change your s so they go from your small [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) (likely with few s) to your large, well-developed cities to get the most coinage. Don't forget about [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](policy cards) like [Triangular%20Trade%20%28Civ6%29](Triangular Trade) to further your output. [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](Civilizations) and [Leaders%20%28Civ6%29](leaders) with bonuses for domestic s like [Pachacuti%20%28Civ6%29](Pachacuti), [Polish%20%28Civ6%29](Poland), [Poundmaker%20%28Civ6%29](Poundmaker), and [Tokugawa%20%28Civ6%29](Tokugawa) should aim for Todar Mal.
