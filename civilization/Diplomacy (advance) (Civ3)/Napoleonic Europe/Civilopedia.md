# Diplomacy (advance) (Civ3)/Napoleonic Europe/Civilopedia

Napoleon liked to say that "Governments keep their promises only when they are forced, or when it
is to their advantage to do so." Political diplomacy during the Napoleonic era was as rife with
subterfuge and chicanery as any in world history. Political alliances shifted as the wind blew.
Mutual Protection Pacts (called Coalitions) were struck often between
nations trying to seek physical and economic security against France.
