# Diplomacy (advance) (Civ3)/Mesopotamia/Civilopedia

Diplomacy in some form or another would have predated recorded history, in the form of hunting and
marriage agreements between tribes. Diplomatic messengers were usually inviolable and would frequently carry
some kind of emblem showing their "diplomatic" status. With the development of forms of writing these early
diplomatic processes became more formalized. Not coincidentally, the earliest reliable evidence of diplomacy is
from the Mesopotamian period. Here records of treaties between different city-states have been found dating
back to 2850 BC, with the oldest complete texts of a treaty being one between Ramses II of Egypt and Hittite
leaders from around 1280 BC.
