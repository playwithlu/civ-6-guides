# Sailing (Civ5)

Game Info.
One of the great achievements of early civilizations, Sailing develops the means to travel the seas by building [Trireme%20%28Civ5%29](Triremes), and to access sea resources by building [Work%20Boat%20%28Civ5%29](Work Boats). For now, your vessels can only travel in coastal waters.
Sailing also enables access to the second Trade unit - the [Cargo%20Ship%20%28Civ5%29](Cargo Ship) - and to your second Trade route.
