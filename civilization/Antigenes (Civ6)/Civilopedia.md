# Antigenes (Civ6)/Civilopedia

The one-eyed Antigenes began his career under Philip II, served faithfully as Alexander's general throughout his campaigns, and was eventually rewarded for his service with the satrapy of Susiana. Unfortunately for Antigenes, he had the misfortune of siding with the wrong successor state, and ended his career burned alive in a pit.
