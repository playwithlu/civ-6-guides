# Industrial Economy (Civ4)/Final Frontier/Civilopedia

Industrialism, raising its sooty head in the manufacturing cities of eighteenth-century England, continued to be the driving force of progress throughout the next three hundred years. Relying on rapid and repetitive production, with little concern for much beyond their quotas, Industrial Economies remain some of the most productive in human history. Yet the incalculable amount of waste created by these economies remains one of the key causes of the deterioration of Earth's ecosystem and the initiation of the human flight into space. Industrialism would see a revival when Colonies were founded on new, unspoiled Star Systems. The desire to produce "more, faster" would once again become the ultimate priority for governments desperate to gain any edge.
