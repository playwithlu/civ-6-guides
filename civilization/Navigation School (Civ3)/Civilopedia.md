# Navigation School (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Prince Henry the Navigator of Portugal paved the way for the Age of Discovery when he
founded a school of navigation in Sagres on the southwest tip of Portugal. 
At his school, he assembled the best possible mathematicians, cartographers, 
shipbuilders, and astronomers, mariners and together they taught the future navigators 
of Portugal in great secrecy. Henry himself never took to the sea, though through 
his teaching, organization, and leadership, he deserves much credit for launching the 
period of European global dominance that followed for the next 500 years.
