# Mausoleum of Maussollos (Civ4)

Strategy.
The Mausoleum of Maussollos increases its builder's [Golden%20Age%20%28Civ4%29](Golden Ages) by fifty percent. It also increases the chances of a [Great%20Artist%20%28Civ4%29](Great Artist) appearing.
This wonder has little impact alone, but can be greatly useful if Golden Ages form a key part of your strategies. If you're emphasizing a particular type of [Great%20Person%20%28Civ4%29](Great Person), any other "waste" Great People can be used to start Golden Ages instead, and this wonder serves as compensation.
Alternatively, if you can afford to, aim to get both this wonder and the [Taj%20Mahal%20%28Civ4%29](Taj Mahal), to emphasize the latter's bonus.
