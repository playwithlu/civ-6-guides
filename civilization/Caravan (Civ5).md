# Caravan (Civ5)

Game Info.
Land trading unit.
Strategy.
The Caravan is the first trading unit in the game, appearing very early in the [Ancient%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Ancient Era). Research [Animal%20Husbandry%20%28Civ5%29](Animal Husbandry) to unlock it, along with your first Trade route option, then build a Caravan to establish trade with your neighbors. In "", [International%20trade%20route%20%28Civ5%29](Trade Routes) are essential to keep your balance positive.
Caravans may be based in any city, be it inland or [Coastal%20%28Civ5%29](coastal), and can establish Trade Routes with other cities on the same landmass. So don't base a Caravan on a small island - it won't be able to trade with anyone! In such cities, use a [Cargo%20Ship%20%28Civ5%29](Cargo Ship) instead.
Note that you may only build (or purchase) trading units if you have free Trade Route slots available.
Starting in the [Atomic%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Atomic Era), the Caravan will have the graphic of a truck.
Be warned that the Caravan, as a civilian unit, is defenseless and will be destroyed if any hostile force raids your Trade Route! Protect it as best you can, especially from the [Barbarian%20%28Civ5%29](Barbarians)! They move 2 tiles at the start of each turn, regardless of the presence of roads or railroads.
