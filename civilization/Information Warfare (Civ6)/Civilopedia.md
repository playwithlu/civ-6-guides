# Information Warfare (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Even ancient military theorists understood the importance of warping the enemy's sense prior to going to battle. From these ancient truisms have come increasingly sophisticated ways of influencing the attitudes of the enemy population to reduce war support within the enemy state. In the present day, this can include manipulating social media, creating and spreading counternarratives on the conflict, and providing alternate facts. Often these are disguised so as to appear as coming from within the target state, thus making opposition seem broader and more socially acceptable than it is in reality. This can have truly pernicious effects within the target state.
