# Goods (CTP2)

Goods are trade items that can be found in different [Terrain%20%28CTP2%29](terrains) on the world map in "[Call%20to%20Power%20II](Call to Power II)". They include raw materials, precious stones, foodstuffs, and finished products. There are both common and rare goods, though both of these do not appear on all types of terrain.
A civilization with goods can earn gold by trading them with its own and other civilizations' [City%20%28CTP2%29](cities), with their price depending on their scarcity in the world and how far away they are from a city that will buy them.
