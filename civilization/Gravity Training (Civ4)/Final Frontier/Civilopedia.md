# Gravity Training (Civ4)/Final Frontier/Civilopedia

One of the most important steps in the advancement of modern warfare has been the development of gravity training facilities. The first interplanetary invasions of rebellious colonies, initiated by the PDE, were terribly botched affairs, with the majority of the invading force fainting as they hit 4 times the Earth's gravity upon entering the enemy atmosphere. With the development of Gravity Training, disseminated through Training Compounds, soldiers could now endure the gravitational forces generated by craft entering a planet's atmosphere. These developments also prompted the creation of the first dedicated Invasion Ships that made global invasions much more effective than in the past.
