# Cobra Strike (Civ6)/Civilopedia

There have long been rumors of a prohibited fighting style, an arcane art whose viciousness knew no rival. And some say that this technique had one move, one strike above all others, whose lethality was such that even a casual sparring match could result in one opponent's unfortunate end.
While conventional wisdom in the martial world says the Cobra Strike has been lost to history, one wonders if some brave (or reckless) souls were able to keep it alive.
