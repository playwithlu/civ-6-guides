# Norwegian (Civ6)/Vikings, Traders, and Raiders!

The Norwegian people represent a playable [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) from the [Vikings%2C%20Traders%2C%20and%20Raiders%21%20%28Civ6%29](Vikings, Traders, and Raiders!) [List%20of%20scenarios%20in%20Civ6](scenario) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". They are led by [Harald%20Hardrada%20%28Civ6%29/Vikings%2C%20Traders%2C%20and%20Raiders%21](Harald Hardrada), and their [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](civilization ability)Â is "Viking," which allows their [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](units) to ignore additional {{Movement6}} costs for embarking and disembarking.
