# Exploding Palms (Civ6)/Civilopedia

There are times when a fighter, in the heat of battle, may find themselves consumed by the red mist of combat. One might even think their palms were exploding with supernatural force. The warrior monks of history are believed to have harnessed this sort of technique, using this "power" to strike down one or more opponents.
Of course, this is all hearsay, the words of the victors or, perhaps, the terrified survivors.
