# Leaders

Leaders are symbolic representatives of the [civilizations](civilizations) in the "[Civilization%20%28series%29](Civilization)" and "[Call%20to%20Power%20games](Call to Power)" games.
In the first three "Civilization" games, each civilization had only one leader who was inseparable from the civ they led. However, "[Civilization%20IV](Civilization IV)" added the possibility of not only choosing your civ but your leader as well, giving each civ up to three different leaders to choose from. See the [list%20of%20civilizations](list of civilizations) article for a summary of available civs and leaders.
"Unmet" will be displayed instead of the actual name of any leader the player has yet to meet.
