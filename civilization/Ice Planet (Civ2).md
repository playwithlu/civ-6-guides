Intro.
Sometime in the far off future, the human race develops the technology to travel between the stars. Not sure of what they will find on their voyage to the unknown, the humans assemble the most elite troops on the planet into a single force aptly named the Galaxial Troops. With high hopes they set out to the closest known planet in another galaxy - [Jharlei](Jharlei): The Ice Planet. What they found on this seemingly barren world turned their historic mission into a fight for survival.
An ancient alien force called the Kydextrians landed before the humans. They have come to Jharlei in search of a rare element, called Tronadium, that is required by the royal egg-layer. This Royal Kydextrian Hive Empress, named Gila by the native Ventry race, is the key to the survival of these hideous xenophages. The Kydextrians have begun their quest to rid the planet of any other life and claim the planet for their own. As the Ventry Nation, your goal is to simply survive and fend off this alien menace. As the Galaxial Troops, your mission is to stay alive long enough to rebuild another spacecraft to return home. Finally, as the Kydextrians...kill or be killed.
