Great Library entry.
In 2244, three centuries after the emergence of jet fighters and the first space shuttle launch, the Germans and British co-produced the first space fighter. This space fighter, named the Sun Storm, also functioned as an effective atmospheric combat aircraft. When Space Fighters launched from a space station they could attack standard fighters almost without warning. The Sun Storm served as the dominant combat aircraft until the Russians improved the range and armament of their own Space Fighter.
