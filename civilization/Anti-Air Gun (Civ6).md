# Anti-Air Gun (Civ6)

The Anti-Air Gun is an [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Support](support unit) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
The Anti-Air Gun employs flak shells to shoot down incoming enemy aircraft. It defends all friendly units in its [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tile) and adjacent tiles from [Air%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](air units), damaging or destroying them before they strike. It also offers some protection from [Nuclear%20weapons%20%28Civ6%29](nuclear weapons): if a bomber is delivering a nuke within 1 tile, the attack will fail if the Anti-Air Gun brings the bomber below 50% [HP](HP).
Only one Anti-Air Gun will engage enemy aircraft at a time.
Like all support units, the Anti-Air Gun will be instantly killed if an enemy [Military%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](military unit) enters the tile it occupies. Although it cannot intercept enemy aircraft while embarked, it can still provide [Flanking%20and%20Support%20%28Civ6%29](Support bonuses) to adjacent [Naval%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](naval units) that are intercepting a target.
