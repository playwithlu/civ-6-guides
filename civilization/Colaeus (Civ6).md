# Colaeus (Civ6)

Colaeus is a [Great%20Merchant%20%28Civ6%29](Great Merchant) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Unique ability.
Grants 1 free copy of the [Luxury%20Resources%20%28Civ6%29](Luxury) [Resource%20%28Civ6%29](resource) on this tile to your capital city. Gain 100 .
Strategy.
If possible, send Colaeus to a faraway [Continent%20%28Civ6%29](continent). This will increase the chances of finding a Luxury resource not present in your home [Territory%20%28Civ6%29](territory) so you won't have to bother trading for it with a potential future rival.
In the [Monopolies%20and%20Corporations%20%28Civ6%29](Monopolies and Corporations) [Game%20mode%20%28Civ6%29](game mode), using Colaeus on a specific luxury resource of which you already own a single copy will not allow you to construct an [Industry%20%28Civ6%29](Industry) (as opposed to luxuries gained from [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-states), which don't need to be improved).
