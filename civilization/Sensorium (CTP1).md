In early ages, man's only method of creating experience was by actually experiencing it, drug induced hallucinations or, to a lesser degree, through art forms. During the Digital Age, neural jack users could create experiences by stimulating key nerve centers of the brain. Neural jack experience was solely personal and oftentimes limited and unreliable. In 2752, however, Linus Traum developed the Sensorium. Unlike previous systems, Traum's Sensorium was a predictive system that could generate sensation and "transport" the user to any environment requested. Unlike the neural jack, the Sensorium could be a shared experience. Over time, the Sensorium spawned a whole new economic genre dedicated to creating compelling Sensorium scenarios.
