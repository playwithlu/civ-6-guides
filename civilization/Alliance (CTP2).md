# Alliance (CTP2)

Gameplay.
An Alliance is the supreme achievement of {{LinkCTP2|Diplomacy}} in "Call To Power II", representing a strong bond between nations, molded through years of friendship, trust, and mutual {{LinkCTP2|Regard}} for one another. 
The conditions for an Alliance are simple: Both nations must share a {{LinkCTP2|Peace Treaty}} and a Military Pact with each other. They must also have an extremely high {{LinkCTP2|Regard}} for each other.
The benefits of an Alliance are many: Both nations may travel in each other's territory, regardless of borders. Their Units may ignore the [zone%20of%20control](zone of control) restrictions normally in place when moving next to allied {{LinkCTP2|Units}} and {{LinkCTP2|Cities}}. Finally, both nations share {{LinkCTP2|map}} information for the duration of their Alliance, providing each other with updates each turn.
Alliances are the key to the {{LinkCTP2|World Peace Victory}}, in which the player wins the game by forging an Alliance with every empire on the map.
