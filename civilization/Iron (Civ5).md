 Iron is required for the strongest early-game frontline units and also for [Frigate%20%28Civ5%29](Frigates), an important midgame ship. This makes it a vital resource for all early-game expansionist [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilizations), like the [Hunnic%20%28Civ5%29](Huns).
 Iron is found practically everywhere, which makes it a relatively easy-to-access resource. Still, it's more common in out-of-the-way locations, such as [Tundra%20%28Civ5%29](Tundra) and [Snow%20%28Civ5%29](Snow) [Terrain%20%28Civ5%29](terrain).

Take advantage of this by constructing military training buildings like the [Barracks%20%28Civ5%29](Barracks) in the city, as well.
