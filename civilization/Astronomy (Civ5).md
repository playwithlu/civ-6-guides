# Astronomy (Civ5)

Game Info.
With the Astronomy technology you've opened the seas of the world. Your new ship type, the [Caravel%20%28Civ5%29](Caravel), can travel in coastal waters and deep ocean without trouble. They're also one of the fastest ships in the water, even in future eras.
Embarked units gain the ability to enter deep ocean now that you understand Astronomy. All land units travel faster on the water than they did before, though they're still vulnerable to attack. Escort your units carefully!
[Observatory%20%28Civ5%29](Observatories) are -producing buildings that can only be built when a city is founded next to a mountain. Observatories are slightly more efficient than [University%20%28Civ5%29](Universities), and what's more - they add a science bonus in an era when there is none! Use this to turn a city in a research center and boost your output while your rivals still struggle.Â
