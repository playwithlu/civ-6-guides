# Rock Band (Civ6)

The Rock Band is an [Atomic%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Atomic Era) [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Civilian](civilian unit) in "", dedicated to pursuing the [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Culture Victory). It can only be purchased with and must be named before being able to perform.
Mechanics.
Selecting a Rock Band highlights all [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles) on which it can activate its unique ability, "Perform Rock Band Concert". As usual, activating the ability terminates the unit's turn (and possibly its existence). Rock Bands must always perform in foreign lands.
Each performance applies a one-time pressure burst towards the [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) within whose [Borders%20%28Civ6%29](borders) it takes place. The formula is as follows:
formula_1
The formula consists of three factors:
In addition to the burst, each performance has a few possible outcomes:
Each Rock Band receives a free promotion as soon as it is purchased (although the player cannot promote the unit within the same turn of purchase because purchased units start with no ). The Rock Band will have access to three Rock Band Promotions chosen randomly from the table below after it earns a promotion. Having the [Hallyu%20%28Civ6%29](Hallyu) [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](policy card) active at the time a Rock Band gains a promotion allows it to access all possible Rock Band Promotions.
A performance by a higher-level Rock Band has a better chance of not disbanding the unit and attaining a higher performance Tier. The probabilities of getting performance tiers are as follows:
Examples.
Example #1.
A new Rock Band unit (0 Album Sales) performs a concert on a Wonder tile (1000 venue tourism value). Depending on the randomly generated performance tier the outcomes are as follows:
Example #2.
A Rock Band unit with 400 Album Sales performs a concert on an Entertainment Complex tile with an Arena (250 venue tourism value). Depending on the randomly generated performance tier the outcomes are as follows:
Strategy.
Rock Bands' goal is to tour foreign lands and perform concerts there to awe their citizens directly, thus spreading your civilization's fame and advancing its progress towards a Culture Victory. An interesting feature is that they must be named before their first performance. A unique set of "[Civilization%20%28series%29](Civilization)" theme-appropriate names was created to make randomly generated Rock Band names interesting, but of course you are allowed to invent your own names.
The impact of a Rock Band unit depends on the number of performances before it disbands, and much less so than on the performance Tier of a single performance. Continuing performance (i.e. survival) of a Rock Band depends on its effective level. Thus it is advantageous to dedicate the first promotion to a venue-specific level upgrade than on the more enticing effects such as Goes to 11 or Religious Rock.
The player can time the purchase of Rock Bands with the turn of policy change, thus enabling the use of [Hallyu%20%28Civ6%29](Hallyu) to let the player choose the promotion most applicable to the situation of their empire.
