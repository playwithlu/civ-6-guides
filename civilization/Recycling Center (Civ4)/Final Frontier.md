Civilopedia entry.
Remanufacturing organic materials, which have only four or five major elements, is child's play in comparison to the complicated recycling of industrial and commercial materials. The only machine yet built that can handle such a wide array of elemental compounds is the aptly-named Universal Recycler. Part supercomputer, part organic digester, the Universal Recycler, developed by the MaKGarry Corporation, uses a complex series of algorithms to determine a material's makeup and most effective recycling method. While suspicious environmentalists have claimed that when a material fails to match any of the prescribed recycling methods the machine simply opens a minor black hole to dispose of the offending object, posing great risk to the entire planetary Star System, Company spokesmen rigorously deny such accusations. Regardless, waste that enters the Recycler will never affect the health of humanity ever again.
