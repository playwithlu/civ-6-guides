The following is a list of policy cards in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)" and its expansions.
List of Policy Cards.
These are separated by type, and ordered by the [Civic%20%28Civ6%29](civic) timeline you will gain them.
Government legacy cards.
These cards are available after constructing a building of the corresponding tier. They can be slotted only after having adopted the corresponding form of government, but not while it is currently active.
Dramatic Ages Policy Cards.
These policies are unique to the [Dramatic%20Ages%20%28Civ6%29](Dramatic Ages) [Game%20Mode%20%28Civ6%29](game mode). Golden Age Policies can only be enacted in a Golden Age, and Dark Age policies can only be enacted in a Dark Age unless you are playing as [Georgian%20%28Civ6%29](Georgia).
The following Dark Age policy cards from the base game are modified in the Dramatic Ages game mode. If a base game Dark Age policy card is not mentioned here, that card is available in this game mode without any changes.
