# Amphitheatre (Civ3)/Civilopedia

The art of storytelling eventually led to drama as a form of entertainment for the masses. The rise of drama
eventually necessitated a structure in which to conduct public performances, thus was born the amphitheatre. The
ancient amphitheatre was typically a semi-circular or elliptical structure in which a central stage was surrounded
by rising tiers of seats. Earliest forms would commonly have been carved directly into a hillside. The ancient
Greeks perfected the amphitheatre, constructing them of carefully hewn stone capable of seating several
hundred spectators.
