# Globe Theatre (Civ5)

Strategy.
One of the first -oriented wonders, the Globe Theatre offers 2 slots for [Great%20Work%20%28Civ5%29](Great Works of Writing) with a nice and usually easily achievable [Theming%20bonus%20%28Civ5%29](theming bonus). Just have 1 [Great%20Writer%20%28Civ5%29](Great Writer) ready, and when you get the free Writer from completing the wonder you can instantly activate the bonus.
Alternatively, you can grab the [Leaning%20Tower%20of%20Pisa%20%28Civ5%29](Leaning Tower of Pisa) (unlocked with the same [List%20of%20technologies%20in%20Civ5](technology)) and choose a free [Great%20Engineer%20%28Civ5%29](Great Engineer) to finish this wonder nearly immediately, grabbing two wonders for the price of one.
