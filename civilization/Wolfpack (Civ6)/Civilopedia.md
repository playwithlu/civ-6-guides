# Wolfpack (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Admiral Karl Donitz coined the term Rudeltaktik (or "tactics of a pack") to describe his strategy of U-boat warfare in the Atlantic; it was the Allies that used "wolfpack" to refer to the mass-attack of gathered subs against convoys â€“ less accurate, but more metaphoric. As the war progressed, rather than simply wandering about until a target was found for their torpedoes, U-boats patrolled separately but strung out along coordinated lines across convoy lanes. When a U-boat captain spotted a convoy, he signaled the others of the "pack" to gather and launch a series of attacks on the merchants while bypassing their overstretched escorts. It was highly effective, until advances in detection gear and anti-sub weaponry won the Battle of the Atlantic in late 1944.
