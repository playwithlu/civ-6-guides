# Exotic Birds (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Mesoamericans used a variety of different bird feathers as a currency and for their headdresses and costumes. The most commonly used feathers were from the Quetzal bird, found in the Guatemalan highlands. Quetzalcoatl, the feathered serpent, legendary god-king for the Aztecs and the Mayas (who called him Kukulcan) shares his name with this bird.
