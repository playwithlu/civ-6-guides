# Protestantism (Civ3)/Civilopedia

The Protestant Reformation of the medieval Catholic church began when Martin Luther
posted his 95 Theses on the door of the church in Wittenberg in 1517. His teachings spread
quickly through northern Europe. Additional fuel was added to the fire through the efforts
of John Calvin in Geneva, Switzerland. By the middle of the 16th Century, even such 
previously pious Catholics as Henry VIII, king of England, had adopted the Protestant banner.
The Catholic church began to recognize the need for reform, and soon launched the
Catholic Counter Reformation in response.
