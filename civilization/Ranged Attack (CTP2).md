# Ranged Attack (CTP2)

Units with ranged attack capability are ideal for supporting offensive and defensive units. Their ranged attack enables them to attack enemy targets from the rear line in battle. However, if there are no units to hold the front line, ranged units will be moved to fight at close quarters. Most ranged units are poorly equipped to fight this way, however, and should, as much as possible, be included with offensive and defensive units.
