# Grants (Civ6)/Civilopedia

A grant is a gift of public money for a research project. Governments sponsor primary research with the hopes that this will spur application of the research, and in turn lead to improvements in quality of life or new products and services. The Internet is a wonderful example of a grant-funded research project which went on to have a profound impact in history.
