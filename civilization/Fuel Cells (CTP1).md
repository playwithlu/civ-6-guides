# Fuel Cells (CTP1)

Fuel Cells is an advance in "".
Summary.
The seventh Construction Advance turns a Civilization's attention from the problems of large-scale construction to that of small-scale construction. Fuel Cells, operating through the use of microscopic catalysts, make possible Eco-Transit, ending commuter pollution. Similarly, microscopic filters allow for cheap water purification in the Aqua-Filter.

In the late 20th century, the world depended on gasoline, an adequate source of power, but a difficult substance to synthesize. Unlike gasoline, the Fuel Cell ran on a hydrogen/nitrogen fuel created from soybean and solar power. When combined with oxygen and the Fuel Cell catalyst, this nitrogen fuel resulted in electrical discharge and water. Cleaner than gas and powered by soy and the sun, the Fuel Cell gave mankind a reprieve from pollution.
