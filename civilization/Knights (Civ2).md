The Knight is a ground unit in [Civilization%20II](Civilization II).
Civilopedia entry.
Knights were heavily armored, mounted men-at-arms in medieval Europe. Like the samurai of ancient Japan, knights followed a strict code that covered their behavior both in battle and in their personal pursuits. Fighting astride powerful horses, armored knights had a distinct advantage over enemies on foot and remained the dominant force on the battlefield when battles were primarily fought hand-to-hand. Occasionally, brilliant tactics allowed knights to be outmaneuvered, but it wasn't until the development of gunpowder that knights were rendered obsolete.
