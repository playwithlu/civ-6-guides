# Salt (Civ5)

Game Info.
Luxury resource added in "".
Strategy.
 Salt is quite a unique resource: it is food-oriented, thus giving a bonus of 1 and 1 instead of the usual 2 , but it is accessed with a [Mine%20%28Civ5%29](Mine). What's more, the Mine's bonus is 1 "and" 1 (increased by +1 with [Chemistry%20%28Civ5%29](Chemistry)) instead of the usual 1 . This means the combined yield of a Salt resource on a [Plains%20%28Civ5%29](Plains) tile is 3 , 3 , and 1 - a combination quite unusual for a luxury resource.
 Salt is often found in inhospitable [Terrain%20%28Civ5%29](terrain) such as [Desert%20%28Civ5%29](Deserts) and [Tundra%20%28Civ5%29](Tundra), making it quite valuable for [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilizations) such as [Russian%20%28Civ5%29](Russia) or [Arabian%20%28Civ5%29](Arabia). Use it to supply to a nearby [City%20%28Civ5%29](city), as well as trade it as a luxury.
 Salt also gains 1 with the Earth Mother belief.
