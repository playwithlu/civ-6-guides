# Pikeman (Civ5)

Game Info.
[Medieval%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Medieval Era) front-line unit. Upgrades from the [Spearman%20%28Civ5%29](Spearman).
Strategy.
The Pikeman is a next-generation Spearman, armed with a much longer and deadlier weapon and breastplates. It receives a bonus when fighting against mounted units, which makes it pretty much the only unit that can hope to stand up against a rampaging [Knight%20%28Civ5%29](Knight). A Pikeman fortified in defensive [Terrain%20%28Civ5%29](terrain) is a Knight's worst nightmare. Pikemen are, however, weak versus other melee units and tend to be severely damaged by siege weapons used to defend [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities).
Pikemen are useful as melee units when you don't have access to (or [Steel%20%28Civ5%29](the technology)) for the more powerful [Longswordsman%20%28Civ5%29](Longswordsman).
