# Beta Centauri Guide (CivRev2)

As the Americans.
One reason it's a good reason to play as the Americans is because of their production boosts. 
As the British (English).
I don't know if the British have the naval support in the modern era, but if they do, then this can be put to the max use. 
Steps:
If you've met another civilization, then you've probably established a "lasting peace" among them. If you didn't, then you're two steps ahead of me.
The following is a list of reasons to declare war on your neighbors.
"How?"
Well, in other scenarios, you don't have to keep creating armies because the threat of Great Walls and superior Technology kept the other jerk-leaders in check. For example, when you first meet a civilization in CivRev2, and you are fortunate enough to have a Great Wall, no matter what happens, they will always offer peace. In Beta Centuri,they'll still offer peace, but it will be because they've just met you. Later, they'll come at you with Stealth Bombers, Drones, and Jet Fighters. So, you'll need to "Reagan it up" and build, build, and build some more. Create an Air Force/Wing, build a Sea Fleet, and an Army, so then you're protected against outside attack.
A Laser Defense is basically an upgraded Wall system.
