# Thermal Bath (Civ6)/Civilopedia

The culture of bathing in Hungary has deep roots from both the East and West, and the country is dotted with numerous natural thermal springs. Some of the most famous baths were built near Budapest, including the grand Szechenyi, the luxurious Art Nouveau styled Gellert, and the ancient Rudas (which still preserves much of its Ottoman style). The baths and their buildings boast grand architecture and artwork, and huge bathing pools. Hungary may have the largest proportion of thermal baths per capita of any country in the world, and they are a popular draw for tourists.
If you go to a Hungarian thermal bath, you have a number of choices available to you. You can relax in the warm indoor pools and soak in the salubrious mineral waters. You may get a massage. You can visit a sauna, or douse yourself in cold water should you choose. You should definitely have a friendly chat with your companions. The quality of the water at each bath is said to benefit a specific set of conditions, which would seem to warrant an in-person comparisonâ€”for science's sake, of course.
