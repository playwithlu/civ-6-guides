# Cataract (Civ6)/Civilopedia

The six cataracts of the Nile river vary between shallows and rapids. Depending on the water level, it was possible to cross the cataracts by fording or by boat. Traditionally, Egypt claimed the portion of the Nile north of the First Cataract, while Nubia claimed the portion to the south.
