Strategy.
The Habitation System increases the Population limit of the planet it's built on, which is vital for long-term growth.
Civilopedia entry.
One needs only look to history's premier metropolis of Philadelphia to see the wonders of a well-designed Habitation System. A perfected recycling system, employing a series of genetically modified E. coli bacteria to consume organic material, blends seamlessly into the city's surrounding countryside, purifying waste water to allow reuse, so all that drains into nearby Delaware Bay is a trickle of water. By harnessing this technology, blossoming Colonies can quickly turn man's most abundant resource, his waste, into usable sources of water, allowing such Colonies to outgrow their less efficient neighbors. In combination with new controlled-environment technology, the supportable population of a region is greatly increased through the use of such systems.
