# Mech. Inf. (Civ2)

The Mechanized Infantry is a ground unit in [Civilization%20II](Civilization II).
Civilopedia entry.
The introduction of armored tanks meant that armies could quickly break through enemy defensive positions and move aggressively forward on the battlefield. Such a quick advance, however, left the ground won in the advance largely undefended. Mechanized infantry, which was first used during World War II, was designed to be able to move in quickly and defend the area behind the tanks. Infantry were mounted in armored vehicles, such as half-tracks and Armored Personnel Carriers (APCs), to carry them quickly and safely along with the rapidly advancing armored divisions.
Trivia.
The model of the Mechanized Infantry unit is based on the vehicle.
