# Oligarchy (Civ5)

Oligarchy is a [Social%20policies%20%28Civ5%29](social policy) in "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)". It is part of the [Tradition%20%28Civ5%29](Tradition) tree.
The formation of an Oligarchy is the beginning of feudalism, when a particular group of people native to this part of the country take the power and hold it by any means necessary. This benefits greatly local defense, since this group undertakes the obligation to pay any units from the central army stationed there, and is interested in helping it out by any means necessary. After all, they defend their interests!
Strategy.
Adopting Oligarchy is necessary to progress further down the tree, so it is generally a no-brainer. To make best use of it, keep a unit stationed in each city - this will offset its maintenance cost, freeing up {{Gold5}} for other, more important purposes. And, of course, it greatly increases the defensive power of a city, which is extremely useful for defense-oriented empires in all stages of the game.
