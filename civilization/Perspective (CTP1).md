Great Library entry.
Perspective is a uniquely western art form developed in the 14th century. Unlike previous art forms, perspective placed man and man's eye at the heart of the painting, seeking to recreate the vision of man. This departure from the more godlike point of view of early artistic styles exposed a shift in thinking about man's role in the universe.
