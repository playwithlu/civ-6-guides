In-Game.
Elizabeth I's unique [Agenda%20%28Civ6%29](agenda) is Trade Agreement. She tries to have as many {{TradeRoute6}}s as possible, likes [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) that send {{TradeRoute6}}s to her [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) and dislikes civilizations that do not send {{TradeRoute6}}s to her cities.
Her [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader ability) is Drake's Legacy. She receives +2 {{TradeRoute6}} capacity upon recruiting her first {{Admiral6}}. She also earns +3 {{Gold6}} for each specialty {{District6}} in the origin city when sending {{TradeRoute6}}s to [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-states) and twice the normal yields for plundering {{TradeRoute6}}s.
Detailed Approach.
Trade and {{Admiral6}}s are the central focus with England under Elizabeth’s rule. The [Royal%20Navy%20Dockyard%20%28Civ6%29](Royal Naval Dockyard) gives you additional naval [Movement%20%28Civ6%29](movement) and {{Admiral6}} points. Use the additional naval movement with the [Sea%20Dog%20%28Civ6%29](Sea Dog) [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](unit) to plunder enemy {{TradeRoute6}}s and receive increased booty with Drake’s Legacy. Once you receive your first {{Admiral6}} you receive 2 extra {{TradeRoute6}}s; send them to City-States to quickly fill your treasury.
