# Garrison (Civ3)/Civilopedia

After conquering a territory, the Romans were masters at putting its people back to work. One of the ways in
which they would do this was to recruit men from the local populace to guard their own settlement, now oft fortified,
especially if on the outskirts of the empire. The garrison unit thus represents a band of men armed with second-line
weapons and with enough training enough to man the local defenses. Unless under extreme circumstances, such a garrison
unit would not campaign alongside Roman legions as it simply did not have the requisite skill and training to conduct
complicated offensive operations.
