# City (CivBE)

A city is the basic unit of a [Colony%20%28CivBE%29](colony), and easily its most valuable asset.

Outposts.
Newly founded cities begin as 0- outposts, which can't produce anything and are vulnerable. An Outpost grows into a full City over time, once it has acquired all adjacent tiles. Establishing Trade Routes with an Outpost accelerates this process. If an Outpost is captured by a rival faction, it is destroyed (it becomes a [Derelict%20Settlement%20%28CivBE%29](Derelict Settlement)); it is not converted (unless that faction has purchased the Might virtue Liberation Army). Outposts cannot be attacked without declaring war on the owner.
