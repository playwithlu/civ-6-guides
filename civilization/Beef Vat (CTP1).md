Effect.
Unmatched in food production, the Beef Vat simmers away night and day at synth-beef creation. The convenience of unlimited food comes at a price; pollution increases for each food unit created. Though the people's carnivorous impulses are temporarily appeased, the Earth pays the price for their rapacity.
Great Library entry.
By the end of the 22nd century the world population surpassed twenty billion and faced a global food and water shortage. When the genetically engineered wheat-bean failed to end the crisis, agri-business created the Beef Vat. The Beef Vat took sulfide-eating bacteria found in oceanic hot springs and spliced them with common Hereford stock. The resulting bovine synth consumed sulfides while retaining much of the look and feel of beef, thus ending the urban food riots of Amerstdam. Let them eat steak!
