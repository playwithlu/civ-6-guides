# Food Tanks (CTP1)

Gameplay.
Food Tanks are the largest of the space based farm tiles. They use genetically enhanced crops to create +60 {{LinkCTP1|food}} when worked. This improvement costs 2,200 PW and takes two turns to build in space.
Great Library entry.
Food Tanks provided a new means of storing and delivering food between Food Pods and colonists. Vacuum refrigeration served as an efficient means of food storage.
