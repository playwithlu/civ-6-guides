Summary.
Unified Physics, the fourth Electrical Advance, enlightens and empowers mankind by describing all physical behaviors with a single overarching mathematical law. With this new understanding, the Forcefield becomes a major defense, increasing the strength of the city's defenders by 12.
Great Library entry.
While working with superconducting materials, scientists noted strange peculiarities in the behavior of energy at the atomic level. These observations led to the Unified Physics Theory, an explanation of physics that fully explained and unified theories of magnetic fields, gravity, and radiation into a single theorem. Oddly enough, the inventor claimed to have reached this understanding while under the effects of cryogenic freezing.
