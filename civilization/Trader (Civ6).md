# Trader (Civ6)

The Trader is an [Ancient%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Ancient Era) [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Civilian](civilian unit) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is used to service s.
Strategy.
The Trader functions much like the [Trade%20Convoy%20%28CivBE%29](Trade Convoy) from "". It is able to establish a single over land or water (after researching [Celestial%20Navigation%20%28Civ6%29](Celestial Navigation)) to any [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) in range, whether from your own empire or a foreign one.
Land route range is 15 [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles) while sea route range is 30 tiles. These ranges, however, may be extended by establishing s in cities. Afterwards, passing through any city with a refreshes the range of the unit, effectively doubling it.
What's more, a Trader automatically creates [Roads%20%28Civ6%29](Roads) as it travels! This makes it immensely important, especially in the early game when the [Military%20Engineer%20%28Civ6%29](Military Engineer) isn't available yet.
From the [Modern%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Modern Era) onward, the land model for Traders changes from a cart to a cargo truck and the water model changes from a sailboat to a container ship. These are purely cosmetic effects and don't affect the range or yields of s in any way.
