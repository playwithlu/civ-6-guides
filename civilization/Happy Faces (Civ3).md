# Happy Faces (Civ3)

City improvements, wonders, entertainers, and luxuries produce either content or happy faces in the
city where they exist.
Each happy face affects the [Happiness%20%28Civ3%29](mood) of one citizen.
If there aren't enough people of the appropriate sort in a city, the effects of any extra faces are lost.
