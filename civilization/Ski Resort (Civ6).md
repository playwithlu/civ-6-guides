The Ski Resort is a standard [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](tile improvement) in "". It can only be built on a [Mountains%20%28Civ6%29](Mountain) [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tile).
Strategy.
Although Ski Resorts do not provide as much as [Seaside%20Resort%20%28Civ6%29](Seaside Resorts) or [National%20Parks%20%28Civ6%29](National Parks), they are much more consistent and their placement is not a hassle requiring a lot of planning. Since you cannot build Ski Resorts next to each other, the only calculation you need to do when putting down this improvement is how to maximize the number of Ski Resorts you can place on a long mountain range.
As funny as it sounds, there are no [Terrain%20%28Civ6%29](terrain) restrictions on Ski Resort placement. Mountains from the poles to the deserts can be turned into Ski Resorts, so desert-dwelling [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) like [Malian%20%28Civ6%29](Mali) or [Nubian%20%28Civ6%29](Nubia) can still make use of this improvement. And for more fun, if you "shake" the map screen, you'll trigger a mini snowstorm on your Ski Resorts.

If a Ski Resort is built outside a city's workable radius (i.e., more than 3 [hex](hex)es away from the [City%20Center%20%28Civ6%29](City Center)), the city will receive the but not the .
