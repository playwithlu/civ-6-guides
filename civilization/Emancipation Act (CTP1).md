The Emancipation Proclamation was the culmination of the Abolitionist movement dating back to the Age of Reason in the 18th century. The Proclamation, issued by Abraham Lincoln on the first of January 1863, furthered military and political purposes as much as any Abolitionist agenda. The Proclamation explicitly freed all slaves in rebelling states; states still within the Union were unaffected.
