# Airship (Civ5)

Game Info.
First airship unit, able to move over land and sea. Powerful against land targets, but vulnerable to [Flyer%20%28ESS%29](Flyers).
Strategy.
The Airship is able to move over land and sea, shortening the distance needed to travel to the battlefield and opening up chances to strike enemies from a direction they do not expect. Its large cannons can attack enemy Airships nearby or rain destruction down on targets below. Flyers and Anti-Air Guns pose a threat, so take them out early or bring other unit types for support.
