# Hoplite (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Hoplites will always be associated with the phalanx unit formation. This tactic involved 
tightly packed groupings of eight or 16 rows of soldiers, who, against other citizen-soldiers, move and attack
in unison scattering less densely organized enemy forces. This tactic worked well, but broke down when facing
more mobile and well-trained professional soldiers. The Roman legions victory over the Macedonian phalanx at Pydna in 
168 BC effectively ended the Hoplite's battlefield usefulness.
