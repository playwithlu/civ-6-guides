# Cruiser (Civ1)

The Cruiser has a visibility range of two sea squares, and can bombard units in coastal land squares.
Civilopedia entry.
The Cruiser is the modern equivalent of the Frigate. Although much more powerful than its sailing forebear, it is still designed to be a sea raider and escort. In addition, it can conduct naval bombardment of land targets like a Battleship, but with much less firepower. It also costs much less than a Battleship and moves faster. A Cruiser is not generally able to stand up to enemy Battleships in combat, but it can still fulfill useful scouting functions and attack unescorted Transports.
