# Leif Erikson (Civ6)

Leif Erikson is a [Great%20Admiral%20%28Civ6%29](Great Admiral) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". His unit provides +5 Combat Strength and +1 to Medieval and Renaissance era naval units within 2 s.
[Great%20People%20%28Civ6%29](Retiring) Leif Erikson allows all [Naval%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](naval units) to move over [Ocean%20%28Civ6%29](Ocean) [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles) without the normal [Technology%20%28Civ6%29](technology) requirement. In "", in addition, his retirement grants +1 range for all naval units.
Strategy.
While Leif Erikson's ability sounds powerful in [vanilla](vanilla) "Civilization VI" and "", there are two problems with it. The first is that [Cartography%20%28Civ6%29](Cartography) is very easy to rush and on the same branch of the [List%20of%20technologies%20in%20Civ6](tech tree) as the [Harbor%20%28Civ6%29](Harbor), so if your output is high, you're likely to discover Cartography before you get Leif Erikson. The second is that maritime [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) - including [Norwegian%20%28Civ6%29](Norway), whose [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](units) can cross Ocean tiles earlier - should prioritize discovering Cartography because it leads to the [Shipyard%20%28Civ6%29](Shipyard), the [Frigate%20%28Civ6%29](Frigate), and [Industrialization%20%28Civ6%29](Industrialization).
In "Gathering Storm", Leif Erikson's ability is more useful not only because of the added bonus, but because the path to Cartography is more complex with the addition of the [Buttress%20%28Civ6%29](Buttress) technology. It is especially powerful for [Jo%C3%A3o%20III%20%28Civ6%29](Jo√£o III), whose units can already see farther than normal.
