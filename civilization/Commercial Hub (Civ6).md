# Commercial Hub (Civ6)

The Commercial Hub is a specialty in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)" dedicated to trade and economics. It requires [Currency%20%28Civ6%29](Currency).
Buildings.
The following buildings can be constructed in a Commercial Hub:
Strategy.
This district is your main economic booster. Historically, water trade has always been more effective than land trade, and this district's adjacency bonuses show this marvelously! A Commercial Hub on a [River%20%28Civ6%29](River) or right next to a Harbor is a must-have combo in any empire.
Note that the description "+2 from each adjacent river" is incorrect - the district gets +2 for being adjacent to at least one river. For instance, if you put it on the upstream tile where two rivers merge, the bonus will still be only +2 .
There isn't much more strategy involved with this district than the place you put it. It will simply help your flow.
In addition, if a [Spy%20%28Civ6%29](Spy) is detected during an [Espionage%20%28Civ6%29](espionage) mission, a Commercial Hub is needed to escape via land vehicle. With this escape route and the Siphon Funds mission, cities with Commercial Hubs make tempting targets for enemy [Spy%20%28Civ6%29](Spies). Players who wish to perform counterspy missions should place their Commercial Hubs adjacent to other districts where enemy Spies can perform special missions, such as [Spaceport%20%28Civ6%29](Spaceports), [Theater%20Square%20%28Civ6%29](Theater Squares), and [Neighborhood%20%28Civ6%29](Neighborhoods). This will increase your Spies' chances to level up through Counterspying and protect your income.
