# Nano-attack (CTP1)

Great Library entry.
Starting in 2112 Ecoterrorists programmed nano-viruses, mechanized termites, to feed themselves on the equipment and resources of factories, refineries, and other critical production targets. Though programmed to avoid living targets, nano-viral agents destroyed the infrastructure and economies of cities, taking down buildings as well as forcing people out of work. Environmentalists recognized this side effect as the price of a green planet.
