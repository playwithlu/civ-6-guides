# Siege Tower (Civ6)

The Siege Tower is a {{Link6|Classical Era}} [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Support](support unit) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". Its purpose is to breach [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) [Walls%20%28Civ6%29](defenses).
Strategy.
The Siege Tower is the second ancient siege-support unit, along with the [Battering%20Ram%20%28Civ6%29](Battering Ram). It affects [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Melee](melee units) (and also [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Anti-cavalry](anti-cavalry units) in "").
The Siege Tower is the opposite of the Battering Ram in the sense that units will do major damage to the city and minor damage to the wall, whereas the ram allows major damage to the wall. In the first case, melee units are able to climb over the wall, ignoring it completely, while in the second case they use the ram to ignore the wall's natural strength which protects it from conventional weapons.
Note that these two support units do not increase damage at all, but they remove penalties.
The Siege Tower becomes [obsolete](obsolete) (cannot be produced anymore) after researching [Civil%20Engineering%20%28Civ6%29](Civil Engineering); also, it becomes completely useless when the target [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) develops [Urban%20Defenses%20%28Civ6%29](Urban Defenses).
Since the [Civilization%20VI%20June%202019%20Update](June 2019 Update) the Siege Tower has been useless against anything more advanced than [Medieval%20Walls%20%28Civ6%29](Medieval Walls). This practically forces attackers to use [Catapult%20%28Civ6%29](Catapults) and their upgrades once the [Renaissance%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Renaissance Era) hits, since they become the only thing effective against wall-defended cities in the middle game. This state of affairs will persist all the way to the [Modern%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Modern Era) when airplanes and balloons provide additional ways of attacking cities from outside their defensive perimeters.
