# C-evo advances affecting naval units

Many of [C-evo](C-evo)'s [advance%20%28C-evo%29](advance)s add some factor to future [unit%20%28C-evo%29](unit) design or allow a [building%20%28C-evo%29](building) that strengthens all units in a [city%20%28C-evo%29](city). Some advances your enemies research allow the effect of your units to be reduced; of course, that and the other class of advance works both ways.
"Notes: 
"The Manual divides advances into four groups, based roughly on chronology, but an alphabetical listing has advantages and is used here. Other arrangements of these data are possible and are likely to be created as alternatives by selective copying from this table when it has all links in."
"Abbreviations:
""Cost to" stands for "[Cost%20multiplier%20%28C-evo%29](Cost multiplier) increased to"; see http://c-evo.org/forum/p-397-1.html and http://c-evo.org/forum/p-397-1-1-1.html for relevant forum postings about cost
""Max wt" stands for "Maximum [weight%20%28C-evo%29](weight) [of that type of unit] rises to"
""Str" stands for "[Strength%20multiplier%20%28C-evo%29](Strength multiplier)"
""Trans" stands for "[Transport%20multiplier%20%28C-evo%29](Transport multiplier)"
 The term "multiplier" is perhaps misleading for "additive" "factors", but it is correct, because the number reached by all the addition is what is then multiplied by the number of modules to give the total construction cost of the unit (excluding other enhancements that are not modules but have their own cost requirements).
Advances for carrying capacity of future naval unit designs.
Submarines can carry ground units in v 1.0 but not in v 1.2.
Advances for strength of future naval unit designs.
Total strength without any Artificial Intelligence or Material Technology: 128
Note that [Masonry%20%28C-evo%29](Masonry) and [Engineering%20%28C-evo%29](Engineering) (which is derived from it) allow [City%20Walls%20%28C-evo%29](City Walls), which add 200% of any defender's basic defensive strength in a city, but for naval units the effect is only half.
Advances for maximum [weight%20%28C-evo%29](weight) of future naval unit designs.
Note that "ships with a weight of 6 or more take double support".
Each module costs 8
Defensive strength must be 1, 2, or 3 modules (each having strength 4); and you may add weapons modules (each strength 4) and transport modules (each costing 4 but counting as 2 modules for "weight"), up to maximum of 5 modules' worth of weight (or 7 if you have Seafaring; not included in following list); defensive strength is probably irrelevant because there will be few attackers early in the game and the first AI attackers will probably have strength 64. 
Earliest possible units available with [Map%20Making](Map Making).
New designs (all with speed 3.5).
You should almost certainly wait until you have researched [Seafaring](Seafaring) (which is needed for Harbors), because it increases the weight limit from 5 to 7, allowing another armor module or two weapons modules or (more importantly) another transport module. However, there is a cost: ships of weight 6 or more have double maintenance cost. If all that you want is to carry more ground units, you can wait for later advances that let you carry more units on each transport module, particularly Engineering, which adds nothing to the cost: see above.
