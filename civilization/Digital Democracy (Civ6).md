# Digital Democracy (Civ6)

Digital Democracy is a form of Tier 4 [Government%20%28Civ6%29](government) in "". It is unlocked by the [Distributed%20Sovereignty%20%28Civ6%29](Distributed Sovereignty) [Civic%20%28Civ6%29](civic).
Strategy.
Digital Democracy is an ideal form of government for players pursuing a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Cultural Victory), as it will keep their [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) happy and allow their [District%20%28Civ6%29](districts) to provide extra . The Combat Strength penalty for [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](units) can be offset by slotting [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](policy cards) such as [Global%20Coalition%20%28Civ6%29](Global Coalition) and [Their%20Finest%20Hour%20%28Civ6%29](Their Finest Hour) (if one previously adopted [Democracy%20%28Civ6%29](Democracy)), or forming s with [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) that have a strong military to discourage attackers. Players seeking to win a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Diplomacy](Diplomatic Victory) should not shun this government either, as its boost will hopefully translate into unlocking valuable [Future%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Future Era) policies which provide to secure final Diplomatic Victory votes of the [World%20Congress%20%28Civ6%29](World Congress) in their interest.
