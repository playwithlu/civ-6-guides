Strategy.
Naresuan's Elephant is an early version of the [Lancer%20%28Civ5%29](Lancer), enjoying an additional bonus against other mounted units. Like the other elephant units, it moves more slowly, and requires no .
The Naresuan's Elephant trades mobility for additional strength and the ability to decimate enemy cavalry, making it very dangerous on the field. The only units of the [Medieval%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Medieval Era) somewhat effective against them are [Pikeman%20%28Civ5%29](Pikemen) combined with ranged attacks, so be wary of such combinations when you field your elephants!
