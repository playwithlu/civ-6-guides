Great Library entry.
On October 24, 2095, 150 years to the day after the establishment of the United Nations, an international organization of Empathic Diplomats created the World Peace Center, dedicated to the preservation of peace and the pursuit of global harmony. Representatives of every nation in the world convened regularly and, using specially designed headsets, could communicate without difficulty, regardless of native language. The event marked a turning point in foreign relations for many of the countries involved and several nations established permanent embassies with each other.
