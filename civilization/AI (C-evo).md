The AI (artificial intelligence) controlling non-human nations in the free game "[C-evo](C-evo)" may be the standard version or any other that someone has created.
AI's available.
In addition to the standard AI that comes with C-evo, a number of different AI's (programs that play C-evo) with different skills and strategies are available. Most of the following links are direct links to the zipped files to download:
Strategy and tactics.
As with the commercial and the other free "[Civilization%20%28series%29](Civilization)"-like games, there are a variety of strategies possible, though the ultimate launch of a [Spaceship%20%28C-evo%29](spaceship) is the only way of officially winning. The game goes through several somewhat distinct phases, based on the [Advance%20%28C-evo%29](advances) a player has researched:
Given that the AIs are supposed to operate in a range of map sizes and unknown environments (sea/land, hostile/friendly opponents) they often have different counter-strategies for each (overlapping) phase.

Technical resources.
On the [http%3A//www.c-evo.org]("C-evo" webpage), the game, its source code, AI modules, player contributions such as many additional nations, maps, mods, and utilities are available.
The game has an open AI interface, which means the player can replace the standard AI contained in the package with other AI algorithms, either for all nations or for individual nations. The documentation of the AI's DLL-interface is available from the project homepage. There is also an AI development kit.
