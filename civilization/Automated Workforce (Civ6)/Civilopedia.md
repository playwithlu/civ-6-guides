# Automated Workforce (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Advances in computer-assisted work began in manufacturing, with robots engaging in work that humans normally performed. Naturally, this led to the replacement of humans by robots in many industries. There were absolutely no unintended consequences from this event, nor are there any impacts still reverberating through the political and economic world. Now, with the proliferation of machine learning and big data, many analytical jobs that were previously the domain of highly-paid specialists -- designers, actuaries, underwriters, bankers, clinical diagnosticians, and so forth -- can now be done by machines. There will be absolutely no downsides, unintended consequences, or negative outcomes from this transformative change in the workforce. I, for one, welcome our rising computer overlords, and offer to couch their increasingly-severe prescriptions for humanity in only the sweetest of words.
