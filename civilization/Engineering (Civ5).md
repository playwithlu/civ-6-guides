# Engineering (Civ5)

Game Info.
Engineering is the next step in practical building. Thanks to it, and mathematics, men learn to design complex structures and machines without having to actually build them to see them working. This opens up an infinite universe of possibilities and allows many surprising technological advancements, such as more efficient movement on roads by building bridges over rivers (which eliminates the river-crossing movement penalty), or transportation of water over large distances thanks to the [Aqueduct%20%28Civ5%29](Aqueduct) systems.
This technology is lower on the tree, near many of the more militant pieces from this era. 
Workers also learn how to create [Fort%20%28Civ5%29](Forts). They preclude other tile improvements in the hex, but they make it easier for military units to hold the line against incoming forces.
Take Engineering to push your civilization toward major defensive technologies like [Machinery%20%28Civ5%29](Machinery) (for [Crossbowman%20%28Civ5%29](Crossbowmen)) and [Physics%20%28Civ5%29](Physics) (for [Trebuchet%20%28Civ5%29](Trebuchets)). If you're holding off a major foe, this is absolutely the best route to take.
