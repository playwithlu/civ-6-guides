Neural Reprogramming is the process of altering the neural pathways of the brain in order to hinder any undesirable actions or thought processes.
The {{LinkCTP2|Behavior Modification Center}} {{LinkCTP2|city improvement}} uses Neural Reprogramming to permanently "reform" criminals, making crime a much more manageable problem in {{LinkCTP2|Cities}}.
Great Library entry.
In the year 2020, neurologists and genetics experts teamed up to develop a reliable system for replacing damaged brain cells with healthy, normal cells. The applications of this system were enormously successful, enabling doctors to treat brain disorders, restore aneurysm victims to full functionality and repair damage from hereditary brain defects.
Later in the 21st century, law enforcement organizations capitalized on the behavioral modification potential of neural reprogramming. With the Behavioral Modification Center, criminals could be reprogrammed to reenter society, the parts of their brain compelling them to commit crimes replaced with socially acceptable impulses.
