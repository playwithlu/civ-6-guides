# Vampire Castle (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Stoker’s Dracula lived alone – undead brides aside - in a castle in the Carpathian mountains of Transylvania. When Jonathan Harker comes to conduct his business with the Count, Dracula must dress up as his own coachman, cook Harker’s meals, and, of course, make sure Harker stays locked in his room. From the balcony overlooking the Transylvanian forests, the Count broods over his past and future conquests. The inspiration for Dracula’s castle is today popularly attributed to Bran Castle in Romania, although neither Stoker nor Dracula’s supposedly real-world counterpart Vlad Tepes had anything to do with the place, instead, the castle was selected by the Romanian government as the place most evocative of the Count’s home. It remains, though, the quintessential vampire’s castle: a brooding structure on a cliff overlooking a dark forest where wolves still prowl.
