# Propaganda (Civ6)

Propaganda is a Military [Policy%20Cards%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
If you're playing as a dedicated warmonger and the penalty is taking a toll on your [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities), you can use Propaganda to help lift your people's spirits. It's a decent go-to policy if you have nothing else to put in one of your [Government%20%28Civ6%29](government's) Military slots. Note that it replaces [Retainers%20%28Civ6%29](Retainers), so you'll no longer be able to receive an extra in garrisoned cities once Propaganda becomes available.
