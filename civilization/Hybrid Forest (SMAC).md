# Hybrid Forest (SMAC)

 is a [base%20facility%20%28SMAC%29](base facility) in "[Sid%20Meier%27s%20Alpha%20Centauri](Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri)".
Strategy.
You get +1 Energy and Nutrient from forests. You get an extra 50% psych and economy. It removes ecodamage from terraforming 100% (You need Tree Farm first before you can build this). Very useful for big bases, since you can get 3/2/2 resources from forests. It's expensive, though, so you need a pretty big production capacity first.
