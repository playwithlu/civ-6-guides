# Triplane (Civ5)

Game Info.
First flying fighter unit of the [Modern%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Modern Era). Requires .
Strategy.
The Triplane is the first fighter unit available. It is much faster and lighter than the [Great%20War%20Bomber%20%28Civ5%29](Great War Bomber), and armed with a deadly machine gun that is most useful against other airplanes. Use it to defend against enemy aircraft (via the Interception mode), and to clear the way for bombing runs (via the Air Sweep action). The Triplane is also capable of delivering some damage to other enemy ground or naval units, although it's not as effective as a bomber.
You can also use Triplanes to scout enemy positions by placing them in strategic bases near enemy territory (or bringing [Carrier%20%28Civ5%29](Carriers) with Triplanes close to it). All fighter-type units automatically make a reconnaissance sweep of the area around their bases each turn (with their Air Recon ability), revealing it to you.
Triplanes' [Promotions%20%28Civ5%29](promotions) are aimed at improving the basic defensive qualities of the units. You can choose to develop either their interception abilities, or their Air Sweep effectiveness (via the Dogfighting promotion).
Of course, Triplanes are not uber-units - just like everything else in the game, they have a counter. They're extremely vulnerable to anti-aircraft weapons, such as the [Anti-Aircraft%20Gun%20%28Civ5%29](Anti-Aircraft Gun). Be very wary of those when using aircraft! See the rules on [Air%20combat%20%28Civ5%29](air combat) for more information.
