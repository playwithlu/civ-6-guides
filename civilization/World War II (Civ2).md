# World War II (Civ2)

World War II is a [Scenario%20%28Civ2%29](scenario) in "[Civilization%20II](Civilization II)". It starts in June 1940 and ends in June 1947.
Picture [Europe](Europe) plus slices of [Africa](North Africa), [North%20America](North America), Greenland, and east past the Caspian Sea to include the Indus valley. There are seven players:
Before any human gets a chance to play, [World%20War%20II%20%28Civ2%29/Axis](Axis) forces crash through to [Paris](Paris) and take the neutral [Amsterdam](Amsterdam) as well.
Hardly anyone knows the secret of [Advanced%20Flight%20%28Civ2%29](Advanced Flight) yet, but research is faster than it looks. With one turn representing 2 months, in only 7 years a player can win lots of "Objective" [City%20%28Civ2%29](cities) for a result such as "Marginal Axis defeat".
The Atlantic seems peppered with [Submarine%20%28Civ2%29](Submarines), so the Americans (as the western wing of the [World%20War%20II%20%28Civ2%29/Allies](Allies) faction) would be wise to produce only [air%20unit](air unit)s and send them by way of the existing airbases on Greenland and other islands until all Axis ports are taken.
[World%20War%20II%20%28Civ2%29/Russians](Russia) has huge productive capacity but needs roads then rail to get army units to the western front faster.
[World%20War%20II%20%28Civ2%29/Turks](Turkey) and the [World%20War%20II%20%28Civ2%29/Neutrals](Neutrals) are quite small, but if you play past the closing date, you can win with either of them. Even [World%20War%20II%20%28Civ2%29/Spanish](Spain) can become top nation with a bit of luck and a substantial extension of the official closing date! See if your allies, the Allies, will give you [Robotics%20%28Civ2%29](Robotics); if they do, and you are on a low [Difficulty%20level%20%28Civ2%29](difficulty level), you can fairly comfortably take [World%20War%20II%20%28Civ2%29/French](France), North Africa, [Italian](Italy), Turkey, and most of the Axis mainland possessions.
There are [Barbarian%20%28Civ2%29](Barbarians) on the [Irish](Irish) isles (2), the Alpes (2), and the [Middle%20East](Middle East) (4).
