Plasma did not become a viable military technology until the development of fusion. Prototypical particle accelerators, based on the research of noted plasma physicist David Ray, were implemented in such fearsome assault vehicles as Leviathans and Plasma Destroyers. By firing particle beams at their target, they were capable of melting through conventional armor, and could cripple a target's electrical systems, rendering it little more than a defenseless mass. Plasma weaponry undoubtedly increased the intensity of battles, forcing the nations of the world to desperately equip their armies with the means to meet the threat that plasma warfare posed.
