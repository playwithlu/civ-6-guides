# Alexander (Civ6)

Alexander III (20/21 July 356 BC â€“ 10/11 June 323 BC), better known as Alexander the Great, was from 336 BC until his death, and is widely regarded as one of the most accomplished in history, believed to have never been defeated in battle. He leads the [Macedonian%20%28Civ6%29](Macedonians) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Alexander's Macedon is the one [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) that is prepared to go to war and stay at war for the entire game. With no [War%20weariness%20%28Civ6%29](war weariness), the ability to learn from captured culture, and the ability to heal when capturing [Wonder%20%28Civ6%29](wonders), Alexander can keep moving forward on his quest to reach the world's end.
Intro.
 Great warlord, Alexander, beneath your sword shall Macedon spread throughout the world. Every kingdom shall be a unique challenge to overcome, but the rewards will be great if you remain true and brave. Turn away from peace, for there is no way to establish your legacy but from conquering vast lands. Charge, Alexander, and lead your people to glory!
In-Game.
Alexander's unique [Agenda%20%28Civ6%29](agenda) is Short Life of Glory. He likes civilizations that are at war with nations other than Macedon and dislikes civilizations that are at peace. In "", against him will decay at twice the usual rate.
His [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader ability) is To the World's End. It eliminates war weariness in his [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) and allows his [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](units) to heal when he captures a city with a wonder. It also allows him to produce the [Hetairoi%20%28Civ6%29](Hetairoi), a [Unique%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](unique unit) that replaces the [Horseman%20%28Civ6%29](Horseman).
Detailed Approach.
Alexander's classical era military is one of the scariest opponents you can ever meet. With both the Hetairoi and [Hypaspist%20%28Civ6%29](Hypaspist) unique units, Macedon is the rare civilization that has two unique units active at the same time. If their units are trained at the [Basilikoi%20Paides%20%28Civ6%29](Basilikoi Paides), Macedon advances in technology without having to expend the time on developing a campus. Further advancement comes in the field as they capture enemy cities with a [Campus%20%28Civ6%29](Campus), [Encampment%20%28Civ6%29](Encampment), [Holy%20Site%20%28Civ6%29](Holy Site) or [Theater%20Square%20%28Civ6%29](Theater Square). And with no war weariness penalties and the ability to recover from combat damage when they capture a city with a wonder, Alexander's plan is to go to war and stay in conquest mode until the world is Macedonian.
