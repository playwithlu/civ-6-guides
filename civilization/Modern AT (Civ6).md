# Modern AT (Civ6)

The Modern AT (short for "Modern Anti-Tank") is an [Information%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Information Era) [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Anti-cavalry](anti-cavalry unit) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It upgrades from the [AT%20Crew%20%28Civ6%29](AT Crew) (or its replacements).
Strategy.
The Modern AT uses anti-tank missiles that can quickly reduce [Helicopter%20%28Civ6%29](Helicopters) to scrap metal and allow it to fight [Modern%20Armor%20%28Civ6%29](Modern Armor) on even ground. If your enemies have access to the [Resource%20%28Civ6%29](resources) needed to field advanced cavalry units, you'll definitely want to have some Modern ATs on hand to repel their armored assaults.
Like other anti-cavalry units, the Modern AT is at a disadvantage against [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Melee](melee units), so avoid pitting it against [Mechanized%20Infantry%20%28Civ6%29](Mechanized Infantry) and the like whenever possible.
