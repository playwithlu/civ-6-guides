Intro.
Our leaders have failed us. The Red Death comes for us all. Our old civilization could not stand the test of time.
Our only hope lies in a single colony ship waiting in orbit for the last survivors of this world. We can remotely pilot the lander, but the other factions are jamming our signal. The only way we will survive is for us to eliminate the other factions.
Welcome to the last civilization of this world.

## Overview

In an irradiated wasteland inspired by "" and similar franchises, players assume control of one of eight [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) ("factions") and fight to secure a spaceship and escape the planet. The radioactive mass enveloping the planet is known as the "Red Death," and any [Units%20%28Civ6%29](units) that end their turn in it sustain damage and are unable to heal. The amount of damage inflicted by the Red Death increases as the game progresses, but units can avoid taking damage by remaining inside the "Safe Zone," which shrinks every few turns as the Red Death spreads.
Players are eliminated when they have no remaining Civilians. The last player with a surviving Civilian wins.
Units.
Civilians and six kinds of military units - [Infantry%20%28Civ6%29](Infantry), [Machine%20Gun%20%28Civ6%29](Machine Guns), [AT%20Crew%20%28Civ6%29](AT Crews), [Helicopter%20%28Civ6%29](Helicopters), [Rocket%20Artillery%20%28Civ6%29](Rocket Artillery), and [Tank%20%28Civ6%29](Tanks) - are available in Red Death, all with modified [Promotions%20%28Civ6%29](promotion) trees. All units are also modified to have faster HP regen (+20 per turn) and gain full XP from Raiders until they reach level 6.
Each player starts with one Infantry and one Machine Gun. New units are then available randomly in city ruins and Raider's Camps, and you can gain new units and supplies in the following ways:
Strategy.
You should always escort your Civilian unit with a combat unit, because otherwise it's game over. If you meet another faction, try not to engage in combat too early, and instead scout around for Ruined Cities. But if the other person goes after you, then definitely fight! Recommended factions are the [Cultists%20%28Civ6%29](Cultists), because their extra will aid in finding other people before they find you, and the [Mutants%20%28Civ6%29](Mutants) because they can worry less about being stuck in the Red Death.
