# Blacksmith (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Blacksmiths are people who work, repair and shape iron with a forge, anvil, hammer, and other specialized
tools. The term can apply specifically to one who prepares and fits horseshoes, but the more general term
is used for this scenario. The work is difficult, and the physical demands upon the smith are extreme. In
western culture, smiths were highly regarded members of their community, but in eastern culture, most notably
India (where metalworkers belong to the Untouchable caste), the smiths were looked upon as a necessary evil.
