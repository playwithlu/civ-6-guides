Great Library entry.
Soon after genetic tailoring enabled people to customize the lives of their offspring, further genetic research enabled people to create new bodies for themselves in order to extend the life cycle. The Body Exchange Center used a complex neural interface system to transfer their consciousness from their old brains into their new ones. The system also downloaded neurological data into the new body's nervous system, smoothing the transition to a new physical form. With life extension, humanity was a significant step closer to immortality.
