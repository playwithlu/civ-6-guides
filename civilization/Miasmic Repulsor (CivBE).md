# Miasmic Repulsor (CivBE)

Game info.
This satellite emits specific radiation which clears miasma from affected tiles. The clearing effect starts from the center and spreads outwards in its range of 2 tiles. 
Given the fact that Miasma can greatly harm your colony in its infancy, these units are the most frequently used satellites in the early game.
