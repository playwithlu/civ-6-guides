# Maintenance cost (CivBE)

Maintenance is the {{EnergyBE}} cost that must be paid for [Units%20%28CivBE%29](units), [List%20of%20buildings%20in%20CivBE](buildings), and [Tile%20improvement%20%28CivBE%29](improvements). It can be reduced by the {{LinkBE|Master Control}}.
Some improvements cost {{HealthBE}} rather than {{EnergyBE}}.
