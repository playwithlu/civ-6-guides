# Colonization (Civ6)/Civilopedia

The urge to procreate is a basic human trait, as true of civilizations as of individuals. In early times, these were usually established by maritime city-states on distant (relatively) shores; the Greeks and Phoenicians scattered them around the Mediterranean coasts in what they considered uninhabited lands. The Romans created colonial cities on the fringes of their empire across Western Europe, North Africa, and West Asia. Early Chinese dynasties pursued a similar policy. Through the troubled Middle Ages, the only people to undertake large-scale settling were the foot-loose Vikings, but once other Europeans began crossing the oceans they all started planting colonies all over the globe â€¦ and squabbling over who got what.
