# Cloves (Civ5)

Game Info.
Luxury resource added in "". Unique to [Indonesian%20%28Civ5%29](Indonesia).
Strategy.
 Cloves are a unique luxury resource which appear only in one of the first three Indonesian [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities) founded on landmasses other than the one their is on. As such, the resource appears right on the city tile, is instantly accessed (doesn't need an [List%20of%20improvements%20in%20Civ5](improvement)), and can never be lost because the city itself can never be razed.
Note that this resource overwrites the original resource on the tile (if any), so try not to settle these first three cities on top of other resources - you're going to lose these!
