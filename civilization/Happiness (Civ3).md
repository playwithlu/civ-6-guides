# Happiness (Civ3)

Citizen moods.
Each citizen is either happy, content, or unhappy.
What Makes 'em Glad?
To combat unhappiness in your cities you can build improvements or take actions that produce happy or content [Happy%20Faces%20%28Civ3%29](Happy Faces). Each happy face changes the mood of one citizen from content to happy; each content face alters a citizen from unhappy to content.
A city in which more people are unhappy than happy falls into [civil%20disorder%20%28Civ3%29](civil disorder).
Content citizens and specialists are ignored.
Cities that are very happy may celebrate a [We%20Love%20the%20King%20Day%20%28Civ3%29](We Love the King Day).
