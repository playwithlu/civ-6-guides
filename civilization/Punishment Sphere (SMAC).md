# Punishment Sphere (SMAC)

 is a [base%20facility%20%28SMAC%29](base facility) in "[Sid%20Meier%27s%20Alpha%20Centauri](Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri)". Quells all drones at this base with the penalty of -50% labs and no talents.
Strategy.
In bases you aren't using for research, it can be useful. Free Market comes with a -5 Police rating, making it cheaper to build this than to build and support military units with the police bonus.
Why do you need research anyway? At this stage of the game you'll be spending over a thousand energy for one tech, that will just wind up stolen by a 30-mineral Probe Team. Set your labs to 0% and flood the map with Probe Teams of your own.
