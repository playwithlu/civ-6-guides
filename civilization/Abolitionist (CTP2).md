Great Library entry.
Despite the existence of slavery in nearly every major nation throughout the ancient world, some people disapproved of the "peculiar institution" of slavery and, sometimes, mobilized forces to free slaves from bondage. Although they often worked to combat slavery within their own societies, abolitionists attempted to free their countrymen from servitude in other nations. The anti-slavery movement did not gain prominence until after the Age of Enlightenment.
