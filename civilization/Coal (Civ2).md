More than 300 million years ago, plant life growing in swamps began to decompose. Layers of sand and mud covered the decomposing plants, and the decaying plants were compressed by the combined weight of water and sediment. Over time, the plant matter hardened and became coal. Coal deposits are mined all over the world, and coal was one of the major fuel sources in the world through the 1970's. In many countries, concern over the environmental effects of the burning of coal has led to a decline in its use. The smoke produced by burning coal has a high acid content, and creates an environmental condition known as "acid rain", which is harmful to plant and animal life. Despite the environmental concerns, some of the largest coal mines in the each still produce more than 450,000 metric tons annually, making coal mining a very profitable industry.
Commodity.
As a commodity, coal appears in with s, with , s, s, and s also increasing supply to a lesser extent. Coal is more abundant in [city%20size%20%28Civ2%29](large cities); on continents with odd [continent%20number%20%28Civ2%29](numbers) other than #1; and for that have not yet developed 20 [List%20of%20advances%20in%20Civ2](technologies). 
The value of a coal or is multiplied by 2Â½ times if it is in demand. Demand increases with city size (no city under size 5 will demand coal), technological advancement, and distance from the map's equator. Demand for coal is doubled with the development of and .
Coal cannot appear as a supplied or demanded until a civilization has developed 32 technologies, causing an in-game mismatch between when it is most available and when it is most used. It's not worth holding coal caravans in reserve for the industrial age and many are probably best utilized for building s.
Resource.
Coal is a resource that appears in s, increasing their production by two. The visible coal resource does "not" make supplies of the commodity coal more likely, except insofar as it counts as four hill tiles rather than one.
