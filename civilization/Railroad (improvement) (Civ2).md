2 shields will increase to 3 shields. 3 shields will increase to 4 shields. 4 shields will increase to 6 shields etc.
Civilopedia entry.
Railroads revolutionized transportation by providing a relatively cheap and fast method of moving people, raw materials, finished goods, and troops over great distances.

Units moving along a railroad expend no movement points. Railroads increase Shield and Trade production by 50 percent (rounded down).
