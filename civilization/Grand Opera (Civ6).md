Grand Opera is an Economic [Policy%20Cards%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
The increased this policy provides from [Buildings%20%28Civ6%29](buildings) in [Theater%20Square%20%28Civ6%29](Theater Squares) is extremely helpful if you're aiming for a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Cultural Victory) (though in ' and ', these [District%20%28Civ6%29](districts) will need to be in large [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) and have high adjacency bonuses to fully benefit from the policy).
Notably, the [Civics%20%28Civ6%29](civic) that unlocks Grand Opera doesn't lead to anything else. However, if you've been focusing on throughout the game, discovering it will actually benefit you rather than bogging down your civic development as it will for players who aren't culturally oriented.
