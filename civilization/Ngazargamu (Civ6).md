# Ngazargamu (Civ6)

Ngazargamu is a militaristicÂ [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-state) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It replaces [Carthage%20%28Civ6%29](Carthage) under rulesets in which [Phoenician%20%28Civ6%29](Phoenicia) is a playable [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization).
Strategy.
Ngazargamu provides a whopping 60% discount on purchasing land [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](units) in [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) with all three [Encampment%20%28Civ6%29](Encampment) [Building%20%28Civ6%29](buildings), which is a late-game dream for any civilization whether it's used for attacking or defending. If you have good {{Gold6}} income and at least one Encampment in one of your cities, becoming [Suzerain%20%28Civ6%29](Suzerain) of this city-state should be a high priority.
Despite the in-game description, it also gives a discount on {{Faith6}} purchases of land combat units, including [Nihang%20%28Civ6%29](Nihangs). This synergizes well with the [Grand%20Master%27s%20Chapel%20%28Civ6%29](Grand Master's Chapel) and [Lahore%20%28Civ6%29](Lahore).
Right now, the percentage discounts from multiple sources stack additively instead of multiplicatively, so if you play as [Malian%20%28Civ6%29](Mali), further purchasing discounts from the [Suguba%20%28Civ6%29](Suguba) and [Democracy%20%28Civ6%29](Democracy) can give you a whopping 95% on all land units - an exceptionally powerful combo.
