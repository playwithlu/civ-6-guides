# Scythian (Civ3)/Civilopedia

As the Roman Empire expanded its borders to encompass vast regions never controlled by any one empire, several bands of nomads and small tribes continued to florish in the far reaches of the fledgling empire.
One such nomadic group known as the Scythians began their recognized existence in the early parts of the 8th century BC, settling between the Don and the Carpathians in 750 BC As their cultural existence expanded, the Scythian king Partatua married an Assyrian princess in 764 BC. This bond helped to create an even more powerful race, and soon the nomads sought further lands for themselves. In late 653 BC, the Scythians launched an invasion aimed at the Median empire. The Medes, however, were not as weak as the Scythian masters had predicted, and the Scythians had turned back in defeat by 626 BC. In 514 BC a Persian invasion under the banner of King Darius was repulsed. As the Scythian empire started to take shape, King Atheas united all Scythian tribes and expanded their territory to the border with Macedonia, where in 360 BC they would come face to face with the Roman Empire.
