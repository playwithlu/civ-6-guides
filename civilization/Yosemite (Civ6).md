# Yosemite (Civ6)

Yosemite is a two-tile impassable in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". Yosemite may be found on and tiles. Each Wonder tile provides +1 , +1 , and +2 to adjacent tiles.
In "", discovering Yosemite grants +1 [Era%20Score%20%28Civ6%29](Era Score), or +3 Score if the player is the first to do so.
In "", Yosemite provides +1 in addition to +1 and +1 to adjacent tiles.
Strategy.
Each Yosemite tile provides +1 and +1 to adjacent non-wonder tiles (see diagram). However, as with all impassable wonders, the individual wonder tiles of Yosemite offer no benefits, and cannot be developed or improved. Yosemite is usually most effective when it is near the outskirts of a (or even slightly beyond its borders), since the wonder tiles themselves are functionally dead space. If a city is strategically placed in this fashion, it receives the adjacency benefits of the wonder without sacrificing valuable space.
Note that the wonder tiles can be incorporated into - if a player wishes to found a Park, then it may be more efficient to place the city nearer to the wonder.
