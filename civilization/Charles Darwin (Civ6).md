# Charles Darwin (Civ6)

Charles Darwin is an in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Unique ability.
Gain 500 (on Standard [Speed%20%28Civ6%29](speed)) for each [Natural%20wonder%20%28Civ6%29](Natural Wonder) [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tile) here or adjacent.
Strategy.
Before you recruit Darwin, you should check what natural wonder you intend to use him on. Depending on your current output, expending him on a 1-tile wonder like [Crater%20Lake%20%28Civ6%29](Crater Lake) may not be worth it. If you have easy access to a 4-tile wonder, however, Darwin should be a high priority. Below is a list of all of the natural wonders where Darwin can be activated to provide his maximum of 2,000 :
Another Industrial Era Great Scientist, [James%20Young%20%28Civ6%29](James Young), provides two s from the Industrial or [Modern%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Modern Era). The most expensive Modern Era [Technology%20%28Civ6%29](technologies) cost 1250 each, so Young provides at most 1000 (1250 * 2 * 0.4) . Therefore, Charles Darwin is always a better choice if he can be activated with four adjacent natural wonder tiles. The exceptions are when playing as the [Chinese%20%28Civ6%29](Chinese) or [Babylonian%20%28Civ6%29](Babylonians) or with the [vanilla](vanilla) ruleset, in which case James Young can provide up to 1250 (1250 * 2 * 0.5) .
Finally, it is worth noting that activating Darwin adjacent to the [Gal%C3%A1pagos%20Islands%20%28Civ6%29](Gal√°pagos Islands) will unlock an [Steam%20achievements%20in%20Civ6](achievement).
