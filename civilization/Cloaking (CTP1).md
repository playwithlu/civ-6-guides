Based on research into sub-atomic multi-dimensional wormhole manipulation, scientists developed Cloaking, allowing them to create space craft capable of phasing in and out of existence. Inspired by the wormhole, scientists developed methods to counter-project forces into parallel planes, allowing for invisible travel. However, despite the tactical beauty of this space craft, it was still vulnerable. Collisions with solid objects invariably still led to destruction.
