Strategy.
The City Center is the heart of a city, and is built as soon as the city is founded. It possesses health and a defense value, and if [Walls%20%28Civ6%29](Walls) are present, can perform a ranged attack against intruders. If the City Center falls to invasion, the city in its entirety is considered captured.
Most civilian units will be spawned here upon production or acquisition, and so will all support units. If no [Encampment%20%28Civ6%29](Encampment) district exists for this city, military units will spawn here as well. If the city is founded on a coastline, naval units can be created here even without a [Harbor%20%28Civ6%29](Harbor) district. However, if a Harbor district exists, naval units will be built there instead. Also, the City Center can house 1 aircraft.
Since the City Center is still considered a district, any districts constructed next to it will gain the respective adjacency bonus.
If the City Center is flooded, it is not possible to complete any building or project in the City Center, including a [Flood%20Barrier%20%28Civ6%29](Flood Barrier).
