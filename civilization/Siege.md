# Siege

To put a [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) under siege, every passable [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tile) adjacent to its [City%20Center%20%28Civ6%29](City Center) needs to be in an attacking [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](unit's) [zone%20of%20control](zone of control). Cities under siege will not regenerate their [HP](HP) each turn, making them easier to capture.
[Victor%20%28Castellan%29%20%28Civ6%29](Governor Victor's) [Defense%20Logistics%20%28Civ6%29](Defense Logistics) title will prevent his city from being put under siege.
