# Neuschwanstein (Civ5)

Neuschwanstein is a {{Link5|Modern Era}} [List%20of%20wonders%20in%20Civ5](Wonder) in "".
Game Info.
City must be built within 2 tiles of a [Mountain%20%28Civ5%29](mountain) that is inside your territory.
Strategy.
Neuschwanstein is a very useful Wonder, and highly beneficial if built in one of a civilization's cities that meets the requirements for it (i.e. a city within 2 tiles of a [Mountain%20%28Civ5%29](mountain) inside the civilization's territory). A big empire with many [Castle%20%28Civ5%29](Castles) will reap especially great benefits from Neuschwanstein.
If a player who constructs Neuschwanstein adopts the [Professional%20Army%20%28Civ5%29](Professional Army) policy from the [Honor%20%28Civ5%29](Honor) tree (or, in "", adopts the [Ideology%20%28Civ5%29%23Autocracy](Autocracy) ideology and selects the [Fortified%20Borders%20%28Civ5%29](Fortified Borders) tenet), that player's Castles will provide a total of +3 {{Gold5}}, +2 {{Culture5}}, and +2 {{Happiness5}} each.
Given that the [AI](AI) has a tendency to avoid settling cities near mountains, AI players will rarely, if ever, attempt to build this Wonder. This can be a considerable advantage, because once [Railroad%20%28improvement%29%20%28Civ5%29](Railroads) has been researched, {{City-State5}}s will give quests for Neuschwanstein, and it can be built without competition (given a city that has a mountain nearby, that is).
Note that mountainous [Natural%20wonder%20%28Civ5%29](Natural Wonders) within 2 tiles of a city ([The%20Grand%20Mesa%20%28Civ5%29](The Grand Mesa), [Mt.%20Fuji%20%28Civ5%29](Mt. Fuji), [Old%20Faithful%20%28Civ5%29](Old Faithful), [Cerro%20de%20Potosi%20%28Civ5%29](Cerro de Potosi), [Mt.%20Kailash%20%28Civ5%29](Mt. Kailash), [Mt.%20Sinai%20%28Civ5%29](Mt. Sinai), [Sri%20Pada%20%28Civ5%29](Sri Pada), [Uluru%20%28Civ5%29](Uluru), [King%20Solomon%27s%20Mines%20%28Civ5%29](King Solomon's Mines) and [Mt.%20Kilimanjaro%20%28Civ5%29](Mt. Kilimanjaro)) often may not count as mountains for the purpose of building Neuschwanstein.
