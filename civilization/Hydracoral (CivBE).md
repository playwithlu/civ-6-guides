# Hydracoral (CivBE)

Hydracoral is a stationary [Aliens%20%28CivBE%29](alien) unit in "". They can be cleared out for an XP bonus.
Hydracoral have three levels:
Ranged units are better choices for clearing these out. Melee units like s will take damage, whereas Hydracoral cannot strike back against ranged units. This being said, attacking Hydracoral will increase alien anger.
Unlike the most Aliens which grow around [Alien%20Nest%20%28CivBE%29](Alien Nests), new Hydracoral will grow around older Hydracoral, and old Hydracoral will increase its level over time if it isn't cleared.
Hydracoral can not be [Leash%20Alien](leashed), however, they are part of the [Marvels%20%28CivBE%29%23Hydracoral%20Overmind](Hydracoral Overmind) marvel quest. If completed, players can see everything all of the Hydracoral on the map can see.
