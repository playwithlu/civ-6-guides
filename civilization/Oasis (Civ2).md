Civilopedia entry.
In rare instances, underground reservoirs or rivers beneath a desert may run near the surface, forming a lake in the middle of an otherwise barren region of land. The presence of water allows plants to grow, and may even attract animal life. An oasis makes it easier for human settlements to survive in desert climates by providing rich soil for the growing of food crops. Since they are so rare, oases are fiercely guarded by desert dwellers who are lucky enough to stumble across them.
