# Jaeger (Civ3)/Civilopedia

"Jaeger" is a Prussian name for a hunter. In the Prussian army, elite light infantry were typically recruited
among professional foresters and game wardens. The term was used by other nationalites as well, like the
Russians, whose Jaeger infantry were decent soldiers, good on both the attack and on the defense.
