# Insulae (Civ6)

Insulae is an Economic [Policy%20Cards%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
This is a great middle game Policy to use if you have big [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) whose limit has been reached. Before the [Neighborhood%20%28Civ6%29](Neighborhood) there are few opportunities to increase beyond [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](tile improvements), and this Policy is one of them (although 1 isn't such a big deal, it's still something). You can use the Policy in one of your Economic slots on a more-or-less permanent basis, and swap it with something else as the strategic situation dictates. The Population growth in the city will be boosted while the Policy is active, and stunted while it's not.
Note that recently founded cities won't benefit from Insulae - you need at least 2 s in the city in order for it to apply. So, having care with starting Fresh Water supplies for a city is still paramount.
