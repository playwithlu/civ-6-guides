# Insulae (Civ6)

Insulae is an Economic [Policy%20Cards%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
This is a great middle game Policy to use if you have big [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) whose {{Housing6}} limit has been reached. Before the [Neighborhood%20%28Civ6%29](Neighborhood) there are few opportunities to increase {{Housing6}} beyond [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](tile improvements), and this Policy is one of them (although 1 {{Housing6}} isn't such a big deal, it's still something). You can use the Policy in one of your {{EconomicPolicy6}} Economic slots on a more-or-less permanent basis, and swap it with something else as the strategic situation dictates. The {{Citizen6}} Population growth in the city will be boosted while the Policy is active, and stunted while it's not.
Note that recently founded cities won't benefit from Insulae - you need at least 2 {{District6}}s in the city in order for it to apply. So, having care with starting Fresh Water supplies for a city is still paramount.
