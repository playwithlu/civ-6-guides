# Kievan (Civ3)

The {{CleanPageName}} people (sometimes Kievan Rus' people or Kyivan Rus' people and called Kyivans or Rus' people for short) represent Kievan Rus', a playable [Civilizations%20%28Civ3%29](civilization) from {{Link3|The Middle Ages}} [List%20of%20scenarios%20in%20Civ3](scenario) in "". They are led by {{Link3|Rurik}}.
Description.
The Kievan Rus are {{Link3|commercial}} and {{Link3|religious}}. They start the game with all twelve [Advance%20%28Civ3%29](technologies) from {{Link3|Ancient Times}} plus {{Link3|Norse Tradition}} and can build the {{Link3|berserk}} as their {{Link3|unique unit}}. They prefer to research from the Byzantine optional path of the tech tree (despite their early Viking roots).
