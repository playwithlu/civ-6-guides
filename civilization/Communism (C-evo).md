# Communism (C-evo)

[Communism](Communism) in the free game [C-evo](C-evo) is an Industrial Age [advance%20%28C-evo%29](advance) available mid-game and a [government%20%28C-evo%29](government) type of the same name.
The government type compares favourably with [Monarchy%20%28C-evo%29](Monarchy), by eliminating all [corruption%20%28C-evo%29](corruption) and by adding an additional [material%20%28C-evo%29](material) resource to every [tile%20%28C-evo%29](tile) that produces two or more. The only disadvantages are:
Its advantage over Monarchy is particularly apparent for coastal cities that use many [coast%20%28C-evo%29](coast) tiles with an [Offshore%20Platform%20%28C-evo%29](Offshore Platform) when The [Lighthouse%20%28C-evo%29](Lighthouse) Wonder is operative: each coast tile produces three material units.
Mere discovery of the advance, without needing to adopt the government type, allows any future design of an [air%20unit](air unit) or a [ground%20unit](ground unit) to have the [Fanatic%20%28C-evo%29](Fanatic) [unit%20special%20feature%20%28C-evo%29](unit special feature) unless the government is [Bemocracy%20%28C-evo%29](Bemocracy), [Future%20Society%20%28C-evo%29](Future Society), or [Republic%20%28C-evo%29](Republic). The striking effect of [Fanatic%20%28C-evo%29](Fanatic)ism is that if your unit dies in combat it imposes twice the standard amount of damage on the victor, which will kill the victor too if your strength was over 50% of the victor's.
