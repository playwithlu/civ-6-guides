Great Library entry.
The Great Sphinx of Giza, over sixty feet tall and 172 feet long, bears an expression of blood thirsty expectation which led early Arabic visitors to call it "The Father of Terrors." Legend has it that the pharaoh Thutmosis IV at around 1400 BC received a divine message telling him to dig in the sand, whereupon the Sphinx was unearthed after thousands of years. The age of the Sphinx came under considerable debate in the 1990's. Conventional Egyptology has credited the pharaoh Chephen with the building of the Sphinx in 4500 BC. However, based on the weathering, some scientists have speculated that the Sphinx may be twice as old.
