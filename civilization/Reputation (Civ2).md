# Reputation (Civ2)

Reputation is a concept in Civilization II that punishes players for doing dishonorable things like sneak attacking other Civilizations. 
A player's reputation is determined by the number of "black marks" a player earns. Each treaty violated results in 2 black marks. However, if another Civilization in which already have a treaty incites you to declare war on another Civilization that a player has a treaty with, then that player only receives one black mark, and that black mark does not count for the civilization asking you to break the treaty. 
International incidents created by [Espionage%20%28Civ2%29](espionage) may also harm a civilization's reputation. 
Regaining Reputation.
Reputation points can be regained. Black marks are deleted one at a time, over a number of game turns. The formula for regaining reputation is:
Turns it takes to lose one black mark = (24 x [Difficulty%20level%20%28Civ2%29](Difficulty Level))
Where Difficulty Level = 1 for Chieftain, 2 for Warlord, etc.
However, unless a player builds the Eiffel tower, a player will never regain a spotless reputation.
The Eiffel Tower.
The wonder resets a player's reputation level to Spotless. Future violations of treaties will only lead to a single black mark and a player's reputation is regained at twice the default rate. However, a player's reputation will never be spotless again if a player violates treaties after the wonder is built.
