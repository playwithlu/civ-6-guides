Great Library entry.
The origins of tool making can be found in prehistoric times, when early man employed naturally sharp stones to, among other things, dig, hunt and cut animal hides. The human impulse to fashion useful items out of natural substances, such as stone, wood and bone is what set humans apart from other animals. Tool making developed over the course of prehistory and was one of the advances that made ancient societies capable of feeding, clothing and defending themselves. Advances continued, and in 11th millennium BC, Palestinian natives created reaping knives by setting flint blades into primitive handles. Simple metal working dates back to 4500 BC, in which people fashioned ornamental and utilitarian items out of gold, silver and copper. By heating and hammering metal, treating and tanning hides and cutting wood into virtually any shape, early civilizations could create a tool for almost all of their needs, from armaments to farming implements.
