# Bermuda Triangle (Civ6)/Civilopedia

It started with reports about strange lights. It evolved into tales of missing and phantom-crew ships. Since the mid-19th century (and perhaps even earlier if Columbus’s journals are to be believed), ships and planes have been disappearing from the region known as the Bermuda Triangle. More than 50 ships and 20 planes allegedly have vanished within the triangle, never to be seen again. Although aliens are a popular theory for the mass disappearances of transportation and people, there are a few more mundane hypotheses to explain the triangle. Some scientists suggest that there are “air bombs” or microbursts that may have sunk the ships. Other scientists suggest giant “rogue waves” or magnetic shifts that lie about true north on compasses. In spite of the persistent legends and rumors, it is generally agreed that the frequency of disappearances and wrecks in the Bermuda Triangle aren’t any greater than any other section of well-traveled ocean.
