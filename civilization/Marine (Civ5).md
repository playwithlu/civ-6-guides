# Marine (Civ5)

Game Info.
Special front-line unit of the [Atomic%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Atomic Era).
Strategy.
The Marine is a later-game alternative to the [Infantry%20%28Civ5%29](Infantry), specialized in sea operations. Marines trade off part of the normal infantry armament for equipment allowing them to operate unhindered in [Water%20%28Civ5%29](water); thanks to it they can traverse the seas with reasonable security (especially compared to other land units), gain extended sight when [Embarkation%20%28Civ5%29](embarked) and are trained to attack from the sea and over [Rivers%20%28Civ5%29](rivers), making them ideal for overseas operations.
Use them when you need to start an offensive on another continent. They will be better defended while traveling in the [Ocean%20%28Civ5%29](ocean) (but that doesn't mean you shouldn't bring your fleet along). Thanks to the Amphibious [Promotions%20%28Civ5%29](promotion), they will also be able to immediately attack targets on the ground effectively.
