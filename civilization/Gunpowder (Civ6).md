# Gunpowder (Civ6)

Gunpowder is a [Renaissance%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Renaissance Era) [Technologies%20%28Civ6%29](technology) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It can be hurried by building an [Armory%20%28Civ6%29](Armory). 
Strategy.
The invention of gunpowder is to war what education is to social development. There is war before, and after gunpowder: there is war with swords, pikes and shields, and then there is war with guns, cannons and rockets. The quick-moving metal ball quickly renders medieval armor obsolete, and the sword-wielding soldier unable even to close with the enemy. Thus a new era in warfare is born.
Development of gunpowder provides the next-generation foot soldier, the first gun-armed unit in the game: the [Musketman%20%28Civ6%29](Musketman).
This tech unlocks only one item, but what an item that is! The Musketman is the next-gen frontline soldier, stronger than anything available at that time, and can give an important military edge to any civ, in offense or defense. Unfortunately, getting this tech is complicated: you need to research the entire central part, as well as many low-part techs of the tree in the [Medieval%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Medieval Era).
