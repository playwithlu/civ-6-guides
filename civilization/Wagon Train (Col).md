# Wagon Train (Col)

Wagon Trains are used for hauling goods and commodities over land. In order to trade most profitably with the Indians you should enter their 
settlements with wagons full of goods. A wagon train can transport any cargo a ship can, except colonists and artillery. Wagons have 2 cargo 
holds and can be assigned to trade routes. You may never build more wagon trains than you have colonies.
