# Embargo (CTP2)

Gameplay.
When a player embargoes a nation's {{LinkCTP2|trade}}, he or she is cutting off all trade relations with that nation. The embargoed nation is unable to create {{LinkCTP2|trade routes}} with the player's cities, which effectively prevents them from drawing any trade profits from them. In Call To Power II, players can use the {{LinkCTP2|threat}} of embargo as a {{LinkCTP2|diplomatic}} weapon. Once an embargo is in place, the player can {{LinkCTP2|offer}} to end the embargo. On the other hand, if players find themselves embargoed by another nation, they can {{LinkCTP2|request}} an end to the embargo through diplomatic correspondence.
