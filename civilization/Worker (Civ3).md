# Worker (Civ3)

Workers can stack on a single tile, and all work on the same task, completing it much faster than a single Worker.
Building a Worker.
A [City%20%28Civ3%29](city) that builds a Worker loses one [Citizen%20%28Civ3%29](citizen) from its population.
Worker Jobs.
Workers can improve the countryside to make it more productive, by changing [List%20of%20terrains%20in%20Civ3](Terrain) and building [Improvement%20%28Civ3%29](Improvements). The efficiency of a Worker (how quickly it works) depends upon its [Government%20%28Civ3%29](government) type.
Captured Workers from foreign [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ3](civilizations) work half as fast compared to native Workers.
Joining a City.
A Worker may also be used to increase the population of an existing city; when the Worker is active on a city, click the "Join City" button. The Worker disappears and the city's population gains one citizen. If the Worker was a foreign Worker that was captured, the new citizen's nationality will be of whatever civilization they were captured from. Your own Workers may be [capture%20%28Civ3%29](capture)d and used by rival civilizations.
