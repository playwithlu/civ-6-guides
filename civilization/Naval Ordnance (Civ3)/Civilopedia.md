# Naval Ordnance (Civ3)/Civilopedia

The development of gunpowder artillery is closely linked to the development of smithing and casting techniques. As smiths learned to cast more precise shapes in easier-to-work metals, cannons became safer and, more importantly, light enough to mount on ships. By the time of the Napoleonic era, ships mounted as many as 72 guns of varying sizes and ranges.
