# Manhattan Project (CivRev)

The Manhattan Project is a [Wonder%20%28CivRev%29](wonder) in "[Civilization%20Revolution](Civilization Revolution)".
Building this wonder allows you to build an [ICBM%20%28CivRev%29](ICBM) (Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile) that will instantly destroy anything, besides a player's [Capital%20%28CivRev%29](capital), in a square. There is only one Manhattan Project and only one missile, so use it wisely.
