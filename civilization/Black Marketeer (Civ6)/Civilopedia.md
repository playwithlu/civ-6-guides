# Black Marketeer (Civ6)/Civilopedia

A “black market” is a marketplace where illegal or unlicensed goods are bought and sold. Some governments tolerate certain black markets, especially if they feel the goods on sale are unlikely to topple the state. In fact, it can benefit a government to have a line on some of these goods, if they need to be acquired in a disavowable way.
