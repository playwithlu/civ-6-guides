# Cruiser (CivRev)

The Cruiser is a [Naval%20unit%20%28CivRev%29](naval unit) in "[Civilization%20Revolution](Civilization Revolution)". It replaces the [Galley%20%28CivRev%29](Galley) and the [Galleon%20%28CivRev%29](Galleon).
## Overview

Cruisers prowl the sea, chasing down and obliterating any smaller ships in their way. Only the [Submarine%20%28CivRev%29](Submarine) and the [Battleship%20%28CivRev%29](Battleship) can hope to match the Cruiser in sheer strength.
Like many other naval units, the Cruiser is faster than [Ground%20unit%20%28CivRev%29](ground units) - in fact, its movement of 5 is the highest of any naval unit. It also has a respectable 6 attack and [Defense%20%28CivRev%29](defense) and can provide 3 naval support. Despite all this, the Cruiser does not come with one element of naval units that even primitive vessels like the Galley have: the [Ranger%20Militia%20%28CivRev%29](Ranger Militia). The Cruiser also requires [Steam%20power%20%28CivRev%29](Steam Power) to be researched before construction.
