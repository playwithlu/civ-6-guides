Great Library entry.
During the 19th century, the world primarily relied on the Railroad or ship for fast transportation - both powered by coal or wood. It was not until the creation of a new type of fuel, one with the power-to-weight ratio necessary for a portable engine - gasoline - that the car was born.

He succeeded on both fronts, for the rise of mass production also ushered in the era of mass consumption.
