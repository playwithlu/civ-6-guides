# Filippo Brunelleschi (Civ6)

Filippo Brunelleschi is a in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Unique ability.
Grants 315 towards construction (2 charges).
Strategy.
Like [Isidore%20of%20Miletus%20%28Civ6%29](Isidore of Miletus) before him and [Gustave%20Eiffel%20%28Civ6%29](Gustave Eiffel) after him, Brunelleschi is the most useful for players seeking to rush a wonder. Brunelleschi can contribute a total of 630 towards wonders, which is two-thirds of the cost of a Renaissance Era wonder, and if you have built the [Mausoleum%20at%20Halicarnassus%20%28Civ6%29](Mausoleum at Halicarnassus) he can singlehandedly finish a Renaissance Era Wonder with the extra charge. The Renaissance Era is full of strong and impactful wonders such as the [Forbidden%20City%20%28Civ6%29](Forbidden City), [St.%20Basil%27s%20Cathedral%20%28Civ6%29](St. Basil's Cathedral), and the [Taj%20Mahal%20%28Civ6%29](Taj Mahal), so choose wisely what to spend Brunelleschi's charges on.
