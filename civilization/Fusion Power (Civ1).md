# Fusion Power (Civ1)

Fusion Power is generated by harnessing the nuclear reaction in which nuclei combine to form more massive nuclei with the simultaneous release of energy.
This new form of power reduces the risk of nuclear meltdown in [Nuclear%20Plant%20%28Civ1%29](nuclear plants).
It is the final advancement in "[Sid%20Meier%27s%20Civilization](Civilization)" and allows the research of [Future%20Tech%20%28Civ1%29](future techs).
Civilopedia entry.
Nuclear Fusion is the process by which two atomic nuclei combine to form one heavier atomic nucleus, giving off tremendous energy in the process. The difficulty with sustaining this thermonuclear reaction is that it requires very high temperatures for initiation and fuel containment. An answer to part of the problems of Fusion may lie in the development of Superconductors. Nuclear Fusion offers great promise as a source of electric power because a safe fuel is available in large quantities and the process does not create the radioactive waste that plagues Nuclear Fission. In Civilization, Fusion Power eliminates the risk of a Nuclear Power Plant meltdown.
