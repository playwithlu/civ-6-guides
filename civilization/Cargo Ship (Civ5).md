# Cargo Ship (Civ5)

Game Info.
Sea trading unit.
Strategy.
The Cargo Ship is one of the available trading units in the game, along with the [Caravan%20%28Civ5%29](Caravan), and is dedicated to sea trade. It may only be built and based in [Coastal%20%28Civ5%29](coastal) cities. It is used to establish a [International%20trade%20route%20%28Civ5%29](Trade Route) over the sea to other coastal cities. Cargo Ships have double the reach of a Caravan when it comes to range for the possible Trade Routes. Cargo Ships can transport or between coastal cities of an empire and also automatically carry [Religion%20%28Civ5%29](religious) pressure. They move 4 tiles at the start of each turn.
They can only be built (or purchased) if there is a free Trade Route slot available.
Cargo Ships are considered civilian units and may cross tiles controlled by another civilization, even without Open Borders. Like a Caravan, if an enemy raids a Trade Route, the Cargo Ship is destroyed and yields rather than being captured. When [Barbarian%20%28Civ5%29](Barbarians) plunder them, a second barbarian warship will be created.
