Civilopedia entry.
One of the spinoffs of research in the Refining of oil was the discovery of Plastics, organic compounds that can be molded under heat and pressure. Plastics appeared to be wonders of the Industrial Age and were found to be cheap and sturdy substitutes for more traditional materials in all manner of uses. But the widespread use of Plastics led to environmental problems because the material does not decay. Disposal by incineration was complicated because it melts, clogs equipment, and may give off harmful fumes.
