Civilopedia entry.
One of the preeminent scholars of China, Confucius chronicled his beliefs and teachings in a number of books, the most well known of which is the "Analects". This work of a mere nineteen chapters has influenced Chinese and world philosophy since roughly 200 BC. Emphasizing filial piety, humility, and propriety and an honest life, the "Analects" became a central pillar of knowledge in the training of Chinese students and bureaucrats. In face, nearly every official of the Chinese Emperor was expected to pass an examination that required them to quote directly from Confucius' works in order to receive a passing grade.
