Gameplay.
A bustling market where merchants and consumers converge to transact business, the Bazaar is the center of commercial activity of the city.
Great Library entry.
As Trade increased, merchants discovered a need for a meeting place where they could gather and trade on a regular basis. The Bazaar, which opened on specific days per week or per month so merchants could make as few forays into the city as possible, became the ancient center of commercial activity.
