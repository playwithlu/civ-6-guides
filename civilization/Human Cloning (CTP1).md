Although early efforts in the 20th century to achieve this goal were met with great controversy, scientists pressed forward. However, cloning had two large hurdles to clear: one medical and the other cultural. On the medical side, Human Cloning required more than just the creation of a zygote, whose DNA matched the cloning target. The egg required a controlled environment for maturation: an artificial womb. It was only after the creation of the artificial womb that the first human was successfully cloned. The biggest hurdle, however, was
