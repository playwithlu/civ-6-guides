Strategy.
The Cavalry is the strongest mounted (i.e., pre-armored) unit in the game. Armed with a short carbine and depending much more on mobility than their predecessors, they are devastating against melee, ranged, and siege units.
Use them to destroy [Musketman%20%28Civ5%29](Musketmen) and then break through the enemy's lines with their ability to move after attacking. Cavalry are quite vulnerable to the mounted-unit-killing [Lancer%20%28Civ5%29](Lancer), thanks to their Formation [Promotions%20%28Civ5%29](promotion) as well as a penalty against other mounted units. When considering which of these two mounted units to build, remember that Cavalry upgrade into armored units ([Tank%20%28Civ5%29](Tanks) in [Civilization%20V](vanilla) and [Landship%20%28Civ5%29](Landships) in the expansions), and will thereafter require to remain at full Strength.
