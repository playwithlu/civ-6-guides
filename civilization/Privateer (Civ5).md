# Privateer (Civ5)

Game Info.
[Renaissance%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Renaissance Era) naval melee unit.
Strategy.
The Privateer is a next-generation sail-based vessel, and arguably one of the best units added in the "" expansion. It represents perfectly the corsairs that plagued the Atlantic Ocean in the Renaissance, with its two special abilities:
The Privateer's combat strength is significant: although lower than that of a [Frigate%20%28Civ5%29](Frigate), it is perfectly suited for assaulting [Coastal%20%28Civ5%29](coastal) cities and taking other vessels through boarding maneuvers. Roam the seas with it, looking for a chance to score against lone enemy ships, or when in a fleet, use it to deliver the coup-de-grace in naval battles, so that you have a chance to capture the enemy ships.
And even better: all these abilities transfer when the unit is upgraded! Note that a Privateer upgrades straight to a [Destroyer%20%28Civ5%29](Destroyer), skipping ahead of the [Ironclad%20%28Civ5%29](Ironclad).
