History.
The commonwealth was started in 1931 with a treaty called the Westminister Statute and this treaty was ratified in 1949. From 1949 to the time that the United kingdom joined the European union this British commonwealth was a sort of Supra-national union of various states and nations. Similar to either the Soviet Union or the European union. Today this British Commonwealth is called The Commonwealth of Nations but it no longer has a supranational aspect and is more considered an International Organisation rather than a political union.
