# Monument to the Gods (Civ6)

Monument to the Gods is a [Pantheon%20%28Civ6%29](Pantheon) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It provides a 15% bonus when building [Wonder%20%28Civ6%29](wonders) from the [Ancient%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Ancient) and [Classical%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Classical Eras).
Strategy.
Useful wonders such as [Stonehenge%20%28Civ6%29](Stonehenge), the [Pyramids%20%28Civ6%29](Pyramids), the [Colosseum%20%28Civ6%29](Colosseum), the [Great%20Lighthouse%20%28Civ6%29](Great Lighthouse), the [Great%20Library%20%28Civ6%29](Great Library), and the [Terracotta%20Army%20%28Civ6%29](Terracotta Army) become available in the first two [Era%20%28Civ6%29](eras) of the game. Players whose strategy depends on one or more of these wonders should consider choosing Monument of the Gods to increase their odds of building them, especially when playing against the [AI](AI) on higher [Difficulty%20level%20%28Civ6%29](difficulty levels).
[Qin%20Shi%20Huang%20%28Civ6%29](Qin Shi Huang) should absolutely try to get this pantheon because of his pre-existing bonuses towards these early wonders. With his [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader ability), Monument to the Gods, [Autocracy%20%28Civ6%29](Autocracy), and [Corv%C3%A9e%20%28Civ6%29](Corv√©e), Qin Shi Huang's [Builder%20%28Civ6%29](Builders) can suddenly contribute 21% of a wonder's cost with each build charge instead of the usual 15%.
