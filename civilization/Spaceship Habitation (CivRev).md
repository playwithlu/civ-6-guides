Civilopedia entry.
Lacking yet the ability to put humans into long-term deep freeze hibernation, spaceship engineers must create spaces which will allow human colonists to survive decades of interstellar travel with both body and mind intact. The habitation pods will contain areas for work, exercise, education and recreation, all of which are deemed necessary for long-term human survival.
