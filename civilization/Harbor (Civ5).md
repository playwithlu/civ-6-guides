Strategy.
The Harbor is a Medieval-era building, vital for seafaring [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilizations). It forms "water routes" (see rules) between cities, allowing the connection of cities on islands or other continents with your {{Capital5}}. It also adds 1 {{Production5}} per sea resource. Due to [Carthaginian%20%28Civ5%29](Carthage's) [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ5%29](unique ability), they start with a free Harbor in all their coastal cities even if the prerequisite [List%20of%20technologies%20in%20Civ5](technology) has not yet been researched at that time.
