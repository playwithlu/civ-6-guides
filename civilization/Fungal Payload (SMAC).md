# Fungal Payload (SMAC)

 is a unit missile payload type in "[Alien%20Crossfire](Alien Crossfire)".
Game info.
The Fungal Payload weapons package can be used to create Fungal Missiles. It can be used only with the chassis.
A Fungal Missile detonation destroys any improvements in the square. Additionally, the detonation covers 1-4 squares of terrain with fungus, depending on the type. A Fission reactor covers one square, a Singularity reactor four squares. The detonation may also trigger native life forms from dormant spores. Fungal Missiles are considered delivery platforms instead of combat units, and so may not target bases or units.
