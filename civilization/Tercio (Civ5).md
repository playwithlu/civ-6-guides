# Tercio (Civ5)

Game Info.
[Unique%20unit%20%28Civ5%29](Unique) melee unit of the [Spanish%20%28Civ5%29](Spanish) [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilization). Replaces the [Musketman%20%28Civ5%29](Musketman).
Strategy.
The Tercio is the dominant military unit of the [Renaissance%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Renaissance Era), having larger combat strength and an additional bonus vs. mounted compared to the unit it replaces. This essentially makes it into a combination of a Musketman and a [Pikeman%20%28Civ5%29](Pikeman), effective against almost everything on the field. Its only drawback is that it is more expensive to build than the Musketman, though you can circumvent this limitation by spending to upgrade your [Longswordsman%20%28Civ5%29](Longswordsmen).
Unfortunately, the Tercio's bonus against mounted units does not carry over when upgraded. This is for game balance, as a player could produce hordes of Tercios and then never have to worry about enemy cavalry later in the game.
Tercios count as melee units (rather than gunpowder units like the Musketman) and thus benefit from the bonuses for building melee units given by the [Warrior%20Code%20%28Civ5%29](Warrior Code) [Social%20policies%20%28Civ5%29](policy).
