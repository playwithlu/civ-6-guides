History.
The Scotsman Alexander Graham Bell (1847 - 1922 AD) is credited with the invention of the telephone. Bell's interest in sound began in his youth: his mother was deaf and his father had developed a system to teach deaf-mutes how to articulate sounds. In 1876 Bell submitted an application for a US patent for a telephone, narrowly beating out other inventors striving to achieve the same goal. By the time of his death the Bell Telephone Company had a virtual monopoly on telephonic service in the United States, and Bell died a very wealthy individual indeed.
