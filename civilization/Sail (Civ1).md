Civilopedia entry.
Although the Trireme and its descendants ruled the waves for many years, eventually it was superseded by the Sailing Ship. Advances in naval architecture permitted the construction of large, sturdy vessels that could carry people, cargo, and guns, with a very small crew. Sailing Ships could also travel much greater distances than Triremes and over larger expanses of water with much less fear of foundering. This made exploration and conquest of new lands far simpler.
