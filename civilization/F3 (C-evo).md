# F3 (C-evo)

"[F3](F3)" is the keyboard function key used in the free-to-play game [C-evo](C-evo) to display in a pop-up window the [City%20Report](City Report), which lists all of your cities in ASCII order and has several columns of detail about each: generally size, growth, what it's building, and its net cost and total research.
The display may be reached also from the menu opened by a click on the government building icon near the bottom right of the map.
