# Terrace Farming (Civ3)/Civilopedia

The Incas were major terrace farmers because their rocky empire provided little flat and fertile farmland to cultivate. Terrace farms are built on mountainsides in step-like fashion. Rich soil is placed inside each terrace section, and stonewalls dividing each terrace support the soil and keep it from eroding away from rain or wind.
