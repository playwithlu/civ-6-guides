# Steel (C-evo)

Steel is an important mid-game in the free game [C-evo](C-evo).
Its most important almost-immediate value is allowing newly-designed s to have three modules instead of just two, though you may need to reduce the number of weapons modules to keep within the weight limit until you research Automobile. Units built with the "" attribute can have four Armor modules.
If you have built or are still building The Lighthouse when any nation discovers Steel, it will be of no further effect and you should try to build the Eiffel Tower so that the valuable effects of The Lighthouse are restored along with the effects of other obsoletable Wonders you may have.
