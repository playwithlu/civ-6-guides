# Isidore of Miletus (Civ6)

Isidore of Miletus is a in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Unique ability.
Grants 215 towards construction (2 charges).
Strategy.
Medieval Era Wonders cost 710 to make. 215 is a little more than a third of that. If you use Isidore twice on the same wonder, you only need 180 to complete it, a lot easier feat than the full price. Additionally, with the additional charge from the [Mausoleum%20at%20Halicarnassus%20%28Civ6%29](Mausoleum at Halicarnassus), he can finish it singlehandedly. This [Great%20Engineer%20%28Civ6%29](Great Engineer) is worth it every time if you want to make wonder construction a priority.
