# Teutonic Warrior (Civ3)/Civilopedia

The various Teutonic tribes which peopled the plains of Germania during the time of the Roman Empire
were well known to the Romans for their ferocious and uncouth warriors. Frequently armed with a large
battleaxe, spear, or crude sword, these warriors -- if well led and given the requisite numbers -- could
on occasion overpower a Roman unit. Just such an incident happened in 9 A.D. in the Teutoberger Wald
when Cheruscii warriors overwhelmed three legions of 18,000 men. It was there that Germanic warriors
sprung a series of carefully-laid ambushes on a long column of marching Romans, cutting their miles-long
column into smaller pieces which they annihilated at leisure.
