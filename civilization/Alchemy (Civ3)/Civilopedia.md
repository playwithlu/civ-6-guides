# Alchemy (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Alchemy is an ancient science concerned with the changing of metal into gold, the
discovery of a cure for all diseases, and the quest to prolong life, accepted by many
as a precursor to modern medicine and other sciences. Over the ages, alchemists have
toiled in their dark hovels for answers to the most important questions of our time.
