# Resources (CivBE)

Resources are special commodities found in limited quantities on the map. When a resource is "worked" it provides a bonus for your colony. Bonuses vary from increased yield (production, food, etc.) to a number of units of , , and , or some other strategic resources necessary for producing specific units and buildings.
Affinity Resources.
"Civilization: Beyond Earth" introduces three resources that are each special to the three Affinities in the game.
Even though a player with a certain Affinity has access to a resource to which he/she is not attuned, the player should still capitalize on it. Not only can the player benefit from the tile improvements, but also use the resource to trade with other colonies with different Affinities.
Strategic Resources.
Much like the above [%23Affinity%20Resources](Affinity resources), which must be classified as strategic as well, these can be used to make special units or buildings; though they are not tied to any of the Affinities.
Basic Resources.
These resources give bonuses to tile yields, and allow special improvements which raise yields even more. Some city buildings are also tied with resources, and may increase further yields.
