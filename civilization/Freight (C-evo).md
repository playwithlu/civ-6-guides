# Freight (C-evo)

[Freight](Freight) in [C-evo](C-evo) is a pre-designed [special%20unit](special unit) available quite early.
It requires the [Trade](Trade) advance. Standard cost is 60 resources. Strength is fairly insignificant at 0/6 and speed is the standard minimum 1.5.
Unlike the [Civ2](Civ2) freight unit, its incorporation in something else being built is not restricted to [Wonder](Wonder)s. It can be used to speed the production of anything except [colony%20ship%20part](colony ship part)s. However, like units and buildings being incorporated into new ones, it contributes only two-thirds of its resource cost. 
Cheaper than cash for a rush job, but should still be used sparingly. If you change your mind part-way through building a freight unit, you can't get all your resources converted to gold by simply switching to a building or Wonder: you must sacrifice the one-third of its resource cost, effectively redeeming the completed part of it there and then.
