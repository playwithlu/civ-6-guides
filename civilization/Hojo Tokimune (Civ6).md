His [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader ability) is Divine Wind.

Detailed Approach.
Japan gets just as good an [Adjacency%20bonus%20%28Civ6%29](adjacency bonus) from placing Holy Sites and [Campus%20%28Civ6%29](Campuses) next to each other as from putting them up against [Mountain%20%28Civ6%29](Mountains).
