The following is a comprehensive list of the historical figures in "[Civilization%20IV](Civilization IV)" and its expansions. The list matches the order in which they appear in the game, which is roughly based on chronological order. The links point to [Wikipedia](Wikipedia).
Great Generals.
The Great Generals are available in the ' and ' [expansion%20pack](expansion pack)s.
Great Spies.
The Great Spies are available only in the "Beyond the Sword" expansion pack. The last ten names on the list are taken from "Beyond the Sword" beta testers and not historical figures.
