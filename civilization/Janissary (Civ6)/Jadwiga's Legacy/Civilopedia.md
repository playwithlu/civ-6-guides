# Janissary (Civ6)/Jadwiga's Legacy/Civilopedia

The Ottomans take the children of their conquered lands and turn them into soldiers they call janissaries. They teach the children how to speak, to think, and to fight. Then they send them to conquer more landsâ€”to take more children. A janissary's fearsome reputation comes in part from the muskets, which may as well be portable artillery. They will be the tip of the Ottoman spear thrust toward Austria's soft belly.
Vienna is the gateway to Poland. It must not fall. We cannot allow our children to suffer the same fate.
