The caravel was a small sailing ship with three or four masts, a broad bow, and a high, narrow stern.. Though often used as a warship, the caravel could also carry just over 100 metric tons of cargo. Caravels were commonly used by the Spanish and the Portuguese for both commerce and exploration. Christopher Columbus' three ships, the "Nina", "Pinta", and "Santa Maria", were all caravels.
