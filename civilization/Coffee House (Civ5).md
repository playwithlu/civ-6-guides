# Coffee House (Civ5)

Game Info.
Unique building of the [Austrian%20%28Civ5%29](Austrian civilization). Replaces the [Windmill%20%28Civ5%29](Windmill).
Strategy.
This main feature of the Coffee House is its boost. However, unlike the Windmill it replaces, the Coffee House's bonus applies to everything its [City%20%28Civ5%29](city) produces (not just [Building%20%28Civ5%29](buildings)), and it may be built in any city, even those founded on [Hill%20%28Civ5%29](hills). This makes the additional bonus to [Great%20People%20%28Civ5%29](Great People) generation especially useful, as the only other common building enhancing Great People generation, the [Garden%20%28Civ5%29](Garden), is restricted to specific cities.
