The Stable is a basic military [Building%20%28Civ6%29](building) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is built in the (or one of its replacements).
Strategy.
A Stable offers the same bonuses as the [Barracks%20%28Civ6%29](Barracks), but boosts cavalry units instead of infantry. It also becomes available a little later, at the beginning of the [Classical%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Classical Era). Note that you can't have both a Stable and a Barracks in the same Encampment!
Surprisingly, the Stable also gives 25% combat experience to all siege units, without explicitly stating so. This has been the case since the release of "Civilization VI", but it is often unnoticed by players. Now, it can be easily confirmed by hovering your mouse over the icon on the unit panel, following the quality of life change introduced by the [Civilization%20VI%20June%202019%20Update](June 2019 Update).
