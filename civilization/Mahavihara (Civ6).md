The Mahavihara is a special [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](tile improvement) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It can be built by a player that is the [Suzerain%20%28Civ6%29](Suzerain) of the [Nalanda%20%28Civ6%29](Nalanda) [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-state).
Strategy.
With few placement restrictions, the Mahavihara can make for educated pious cities that make [Saladin%20%28Civ6%29](Saladin) envious. While the {{Housing6}} bonus is also helpful, the biggest bonus of the Mahavihara is the free [Technology%20%28Civ6%29](technology) upon initially building one. This alone makes it worthwhile to work for Suzerainty of Nalanda, even if only for a few turns.
