# Encampment Training (Civ6)

Encampment Training is a [Project%20%28Civ6%29](project) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It becomes available after building an [Encampment%20%28Civ6%29](Encampment) [District%20%28Civ6%29](district) (or one of its replacements).
While this project is underway, the city lends its production facilities to large-scale army drills, converting 15% of its output to (maybe due to increased trade from army retainers). When completed, it yields points equal to approximately 22% of the invested in it (on Standard [Speed%20%28Civ6%29](speed)).
