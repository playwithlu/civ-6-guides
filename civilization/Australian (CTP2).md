Up until 1931 AD, the British controlled these people directly but after this year they no longer did so. In the year 1931 a treaty was made between the different powers inside of the British Empire. This treaty was called the Westminster Statute. From this point on it was set in motion that the British Empire become moribund and be broken up. In the year 1949 the treaty was ratified. After this happened the Australian civilization was born.
