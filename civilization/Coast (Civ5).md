Coast is a type of [Terrain%20%28Civ5%29%23Base%20Terrain](base terrain) in "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)".
Game Info.
Base terrain, found everywhere there's land adjacent to a large body of water.
Strategy.
The Coast forms a continuous strip 1-3 tiles wide which surrounds land on every side.
When a [Lighthouse%20%28Civ5%29](Lighthouse) is built in a nearby [City%20%28Civ5%29](city), all Coast tiles worked by it receive an additional +1 .
All types of sea [Resources%20%28Civ5%29](resources) can be found on Coast tiles.
Cities adjacent to Coast may build [Naval%20units%20%28Civ5%29](naval units) and certain [Building%20%28Civ5%29](buildings) and [List%20of%20wonders%20in%20Civ5](wonders). They are therefore useful for creating s using [Harbor%20%28Civ5%29](Harbors), and (in "") establishing [International%20trade%20route%20%28Civ5%29](trade routes) by sea using [Cargo%20Ship%20%28Civ5%29](Cargo Ships).
