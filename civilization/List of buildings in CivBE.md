# List of buildings in CivBE

Overview.
Buildings are constructed in cities for various effects. As in all Civilization games, buildings are one of the major sources of city stats and bonuses, and each type may only be built once in each city. Not including [Wonders%20%28CivBE%29](Wonders), there are 72 unique buildings that can be constructed in each city as of the "Rising Tide" expansion.
Requirements.
Most buildings require a certain technology to be researched before they can be built. In the "Rising Tide" expansion, some buildings can be unlocked combining artifacts. Other requirements might include level and/or a certain improved resource within the city's surrounding tiles. [Aquatic%20gameplay%20%28CivBE%29](Aquatic cities) and land-based cities have buildings that exclusive to aquatic cities, whereas there are also land only buildings.
Cost.
All buildings cost to build. Alternatively, they may be purchased outright with at the following rate:

In this equation "Cost" stands for the cost at the normal game speed, and "GameSpeedPercent" is either 0.67 (Quick), 1 (Normal), 1.33 or 3, depending on the game speed.
 also can purchase buildings.
Maintenance.
Buildings that do not produce cost at least 1 to maintain. Some quest options remove this maintenance for a building type. Some buildings also take up strategic resources. Note that this is distinct from requiring that strategic resource nearby. Selling a building will remove the maintenance associated with that building and return any strategic resources used by the building to the pool. In "Rising Tide" buildings unlocked using [Artifacts%20%28CivBE%29](Artifacts) also do not require maintenance.
Quest options.
All buildings except the and buildings unlocked with artifacts have a quest associated with them. For every building of that type that you control, there is a 5% chance per turn of the quest activating. This will give you a choice between two bonuses. Most apply a local bonus to each instance of the building itself, while others apply a global bonus to your colony regardless of how many of that type of building you have. Unless specified otherwise, the bonuses are local and permanent.
