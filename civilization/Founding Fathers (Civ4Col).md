# Founding Fathers (Civ4Col)

Here is a complete list of all Founding Fathers in "".
All Founding Fathers except those in the Political category require a combination of points to recruit. Exploration fathers require both Political points and Exploration points, Religious require Political and Religion points, etc.
Unlike "[Sid%20Meier%27s%20Colonization](Colonization)", fathers are now exclusive, like [Great%20Wonder](Great Wonder)s in [Civilization%20%28Series%29](Civ) games. In other words, if a rival power recruits a certain father, you will not be able get that father.
