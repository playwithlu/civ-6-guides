# Moksha (Cardinal) (Civ6)/Civilopedia

A Cardinal is one of the highest ranks of priest in the Roman Catholic Church, although similar ecclesiastical ranks exist in many other religions, such as certain Metropolitans of Orthodox Churches or the Lama in Vajrayana Buddhism. The office may entail oversight of large portions of property or large groups responsible for important aspects of the faith.
