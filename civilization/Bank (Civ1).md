Civilopedia entry.
A highly developed banking system is one of the hallmarks of an advanced
civilization. BANKS lend money to individuals or groups of individuals,
providing capital for industrial and real estate development. BANKS contribute
to the economic growth of a city or region by stimulating the development of
production facilities. In addition, individuals can invest their own surplus
money and earn interest on it.
