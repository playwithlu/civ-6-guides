# Lysefjord (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Glacial erosion from the Ice Age carved the majestic Lysefjord out of what is now southern Norway. A marathon's length of cold, black water wends between towering cliffs of pale granite. The brighter coloration of these rocks is what gives the "light fjord" its name, despite their tendency to throw the water below into shadow. The striking Pulpit Rock (or "Preikestolen") is the large, flat top of a nearly 2000 ft cliff near the mouth of Lysefjord, perfect for shouting stentorian exhortations at boats passing below.
