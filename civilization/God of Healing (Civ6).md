# God of Healing (Civ6)

God of Healing is a [Pantheon%20%28Civ6%29](Pantheon) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It increases [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](units') healing by 30 in [Holy%20Site%20%28Civ6%29](Holy Site) [District%20%28Civ6%29](districts) and their adjacent [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles), even for units that have moved.
Strategy.
God of Healing is quite useful for players seeking either [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Religion](Religious) or [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Domination](Domination Victories). It turns every [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) with a Holy Site into a hospital, allowing damaged units to rest and restore their lost [HP](HP) before setting out to convert or conquer enemy cities.
Despite the in-game description saying that this Pantheon only works for Holy Sites owned by the player, it actually works for all Holy Sites.
