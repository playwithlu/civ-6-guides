Strategy.
Banner Cavalry is a unique replacement for the Knight, available to the Manchu starting in the Medieval Era. Banner Cavalry possess a strong ranged attack and an increased movement rate (5 points total), allowing it to perform hit and run attacks remarkably effectively. If this wasn't enough, Banner Cavalry also acquires promotions at double the rate of other units, and contributes twice the amount of points towards earning Great Generals. These mounted warriors singlehandedly afford the Manchu control of the open plains.
