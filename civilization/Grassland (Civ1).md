# Grassland (Civ1)

These open lands have especially thick topsoil making them excellent [Food%20%28Civ1%29](food) producing areas. Food production can be increased by [Irrigation%20%28Civ1%29](irrigation). Roughly half of the Grasslands also have some [Production%20%28Civ1%29](resources), making them excellent city sites. Grasslands may be converted into [Forest%20%28Civ1%29](Forests) for increased resource production.
Grasslands produce 2 food and either 0 or 1 resource. Grasslands that produce 0 resources appear to be a relatively uniform green square, while grasslands that produce 1 resource have a green outline of a shield on top of them.
It costs only 1 Movement Point to travel over a Grassland region.
