Groping for an explanation of the world around them, the earliest humans developed the first concepts of religion. These early forms of worship attempted to give order to the world and assign humans a role in the universe. Gradually the rites of worship grew more sophisticated with sacrifices, ceremonies, vigils, symbology, sacred items, and prayer.
