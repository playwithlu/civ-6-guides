# Workshop (Civ6)

The Workshop is a basic [Production%20%28Civ6%29](production) [Building%20%28Civ6%29](building) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is built in the {{Link6|Industrial Zone}} [District%20%28Civ6%29](district) (or one of its replacements).
Strategy.
The Workshop is the lowest-level building devoted to enhancing {{Production6}}. It is a welcome addition to any [City%20%28Civ6%29](city), especially if you plan to turn it into a [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](unit) training center or build a [Spaceport%20%28Civ6%29](Spaceport) there. Building a Workshop is a unique experience compared to other low-level buildings, considering you are investing {{Production6}} for a long-term gain in {{Production6}}. However, it takes several dozen turns to repay its full cost if you don't dedicate a {{Citizen6}} Citizen to it, which is definitely not worth the trouble. It is often recommended, especially for smaller cities where you cannot freely dedicate a {{Citizen6}} Citizen, to either ignore it until [Industrialization%20%28Civ6%29](Industrialization) (where the [Factory%20%28Civ6%29](Factory) is unlocked, and in "", this [Technology%20%28Civ6%29](technology) is even more important with the [Coal%20Power%20Plant%20%28Civ6%29](Coal Power Plant) being unlocked), or hard buy it with {{Gold6}}. The true highlight of the [Apprenticeship%20%28Civ6%29](Apprenticeship) technology is 1 extra {{Production6}} per [Mine%20%28Civ6%29](Mine), not this building.
The [Great%20Engineer%20%28Civ6%29](Great Engineer) [Leonardo%20da%20Vinci%20%28Civ6%29](Leonardo da Vinci) can be used to give +3 {{Culture6}} to each Workshop, and the Great Engineer [James%20Watt%20%28Civ6%29](James Watt) can be used to instantly build a Workshop and a Factory in an Industrial Zone.
Building three Workshops triggers the {{Eureka6}} for Industrialization.
In "", each industrial [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-state) with 3 or more {{Envoy6}}s gives an additional +2 {{Production6}} for [Wonder%20%28Civ6%29](wonders), buildings, and [District%20%28Civ6%29](districts) in each Workshop, which turns into +1 {{Production6}} for each industrial city-state with 1 {{Envoy6}} in the [Ethiopia%20Pack%20%28Civ6%29](Ethiopia Pack).
