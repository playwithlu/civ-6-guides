# Hadrian's Wall (Civ3)/Civilopedia

By order of Emperor Hadrian, construction of a fortified wall to mark the northern border of the Roman Empire
in Britain was begun in 122 AD. Over the next half dozen years Roman Legionarys stationed along the border
built the wall, which stretches from present-day Wallsend-on-Tyne in the east to Bowness-on-Solway in the west.
Most of the wall was built of stone, although in some places turf was used, later to be replaced by stone.
Ostensibly, Hadrian's Wall was built to keep out the barbarian peoples to the north. As with many projects,
improvements and expansions to the wall continued long after its initial completion date. The wall was a marvel
of engineering. A fortified tower, garrisoned by at least eight Legionarys, was built at every mile along its
path. North of the wall was a deep ditch, and to the south another ditch, flanked by mounds of earth.
Eventually, as the Roman Empire crumbled, so did the wall. Although many sections of the wall remain standing
to this day, over the years many of its stones were "requisitioned" by local farmers for their houses and
barns.
