# Fuel (CTP2)

Gameplay.
All aerial units have a set amount of Fuel. When they move they consume one unit of Fuel per tile. If a unit remains in a tile without moving, it consumes one unit of fuel per turn. Aerial units must land on a {{LinkCTP2|City}}, {{LinkCTP2|Airbase}} or {{LinkCTP2|Aircraft Carrier}} before their Fuel runs out or they will crash.
