# Conquistador (Civ4)

The Conquistador is the [Unique%20unit%20%28Civ4%29](unique unit) of the [Spanish%20%28Civ4%29](Spanish) [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ4](civilization). In vanilla "[Civilization%20IV](Civilization IV)", the Conquistador replaces the [Knight%20%28Civ4%29](Knight), but in "[Beyond%20the%20Sword](Beyond the Sword)" it replaces the [Cuirassier%20%28Civ4%29](Cuirassier).
Strategy (Vanilla).
Compared to the Knight, the Conquistador has the following differences:
Using Conquistadors.
The Conquistador is highly dangerous at this stage in the game - they aren't vulnerable to [Pikeman%20%28Civ4%29](Pikemen) and aren't prone to being attacked when in retreat. Therefore, this makes them highly effective pillaging units, especially when coupled with the [Mobility%20%28Civ4%29](Mobility) [Promotion%20%28Civ4%29](promotion).
Against Conquistadors.
Conquistadors need two different items to work - take out just one of these and you cripple the Spanish. If you have [Ivory%20%28Civ4%29](Ivory), make plenty of [War%20Elephant%20%28Civ4%29](War Elephants) and station them in border cities likely to be pillaged. Build a decent road network in the border cities, and they'll lose their speed advantage.
Strategy (BtS).
Compared to the Cuirassier, the Conquistador has the following differences:
Using Conquistadors.
At this stage in the game, many players can be transitioning to Gunpowder units, or a mix of Gunpowder, Melee and Ranged. For this reason, it's best to research [Military%20Tradition%20%28Civ4%29](Military Tradition) and [Gunpowder%20%28Civ4%29](Gunpowder) quickly to make the most out of Conquistadors. Use them to attack those behind on technology.
Against Conquistadors.
If you maintain a decent defense and get Gunpowder before the Spanish have both Gunpowder and Military Tradition, the Conquistadors lose their advantages. Hold off any hills they're likely to retreat into with [Longbowman%20%28Civ4%29](Longbowmen). War Elephants are about equal with Conquistadors in an unpromoted battle.
