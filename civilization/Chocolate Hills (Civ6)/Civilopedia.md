# Chocolate Hills (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Despite the name, there are no cacao trees atop these conical shaped hills, but instead they were named for their appearance in the dry season - resembling iconic chocolate treats. Located in the island of Bohol in the Philippines, the Chocolate Hills are a National Geographical Monument with a mysterious history. What caused the creation of these strangely shaped grassy mounds? The most commonly accepted theory is that they are weathered marine limestone, the result of thousands of years of erosion. Others have suggested that they came from coral reefs, thrust upward in a tectonic shift. Of course, there are also myths surrounding the creation of these (at least) 1268 hills. Perhaps they formed from the tears of a lonely giant who lost his mortal love. Regardless of how they were formed, these hills make for a uniquely gorgeous view.
