Strategy.
City-states that provide new [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](tile improvements) are quite a mixed bag. They are unique in the sense that you don't instantly feel their bonuses once you become their [Suzerain%20%28Civ6%29](Suzerain), but only after you start building their improvements. Although [Builder%20%28Civ6%29](Builders) can be built en masse easily as the game progresses, space will become more and more of the sole restrictive factor. Therefore, city-state improvements have to be very impactful to justify their existence on the [Map%20%28Civ6%29](map), since they will be competing against s, [Wonder%20%28Civ6%29](wonders), standard improvements that every [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) needs, and sometimes unique improvements.
Unfortunately, the Trading Dome is the worst city-state tile improvement by a large margin. (Read more [Trading%20Dome%20%28Civ6%29%23Strategy](here).) Under almost no circumstances can you get more value out of a Trading Dome than a standard [Farm%20%28Civ6%29](Farm) or [Mine%20%28Civ6%29](Mine), whose yields scale quickly with [Technology%20%28Civ6%29](technological) advancements. And for that reason, Samarkand is among the worst destinations for your hard-earned s.
