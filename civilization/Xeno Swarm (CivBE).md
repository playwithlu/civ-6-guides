Unit Upgrades.
Tier 1.
Xeno Swarm are unlocked roughly around the same time Tier 3 Soldiers, their basic alternative are unlocked. However, while they only have marginally less Strength, they are about 25% cheaper in Production, so if you have an abundance of Xenomass, Xeno Swarms can be useful early on.
Tier 2.
Tier 2 Xeno Swarm unlock at the beginning of the late game and while their Strength is only slightly better than Tier 4 Soldiers and less than the other first uniques of other Primary affinities, their cost is incredibly low - less than a Tier 4 Soldier at only 205. They also receive powerful bonuses in Miasma as well as a signature death move, which allows them to act as berserkers. Xeno Swarm are "very powerful "in hordes, especially when backed up with air support which deals with ranged snipers such as a SABR.
