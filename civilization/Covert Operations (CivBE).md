# Covert Operations (CivBE)

"Note: The expansion has massive changes to Covert Ops. Read about them [Covert%20Operations%20%28CivBE%29%23Rising%20Tide](here)."
"Success is the result of cornering the market on secrecy."

Covert Agents.
Covert Agents are necessary to perform covert operations. Agents have three levels:
On difficulties up to Mercury, only a single successful operation is required for a Covert Agent to reach the next level (even one as simple and risk-free as Establish Network). It takes ? operations for a Covert Agent to level up on higher difficulties.
Some quantities depend on agent level and are denoted by Recruit/Agent/Secret Agent.
Covert Agents can be gained by the following:
To perform operations in a city, a Covert Agent must first travel there.
If a Covert Agent is killed during an operation, they will be replaced by a recruit after 5 turns.
Each city has an Intrigue value ranging from 0 to 100. Every 20 points represents an Intrigue Level, which determines which operations may be performed in that city. Successful operations in a city increase Intrigue. Intrigue can be decreased by the following:
As stated in the in-game Civilopedia, a rule of thumb is that operations requiring 3 Intrigue or less to execute are those which benefit the executor without harming the target (see operation descriptions below; despite wording, "Siphon Energy" and "Steal Science/Technology" operations do not cause the target Civ to actually lose either resource, and "Recruit Defectors" actually creates a new unit rather than reallocating an existing one), while those of Intrigue level 4 and 5 comprise those designed to actively harm the target's cities and infrastructure.
Operations.
Duration.
Each operation takes a base number of turns depending on the type. Agents take one turn less to complete operations, and Secret Agents two turns less.
Several bonuses can reduce the number of turns required to complete operations, up to a hard limit of -80%.
The easiest way to reach this cap is:
Outcomes.
An operation can be either successful or unsuccessful (difficulty), and the agent may be unidentified, identified, or killed (risk) during the operation.
Difficulty.
Difficulty is measured in percent chance for an operation to fail, and is computed as follows:
Risk.
Risk is measured in percent chance for an agent performing the operation to be discovered, and is computed as follows:
If a player fails one of the following will happen:
Even if an agent succeeds in a mission, they can still be detected.
Details.
Siphon.
The amount gained is 5/10/15 plus 1/2/3 per turn since the beginning of the game.
Despite the name of the operation, the defender does "not" lose any .
Steal.
The amount gained is 15%/20%/25% of the attacker's current research, or 1/2/2.5 turns of the attacker's if nothing is being researched. Unconfirmed: The first case may be buggy causing the second case to always fire.
Despite the name of the operation, the defender does "not" lose any .
Steal Technology.
The chance for a technology to be selected is weighted as follows:
Note that the defending player does not have to have researched the tech for the attacker to gain it (?)
Worm Strike
National Security Project.
Any Covert Agents not assigned to a city will be at Headquarters. Players may choose a single National Security Project which these Covert Agents will contribute to:
Diplomacy.
After catching and killing an enemy agent in a cities (requires an active Counter-Intelligence operation with agent present in that cities), players can contact that faction, and ask them not to do covert operations in their cities again. Sometimes they will agree.
Conversely, should an agent be identified during an operation in a foreign city, whether killed or not, that faction (if AI) will always initiate a dialogue addressing the incident during their next turn. Depending on the relationship between the player's civilization and that faction, the result can be as benign as the offending player promising not to dispatch agents there again and them accepting (Friendly or Neutral at the time of discovery), to an angry demand to stop followed shortly by a formal global Condemnation of the offending player's Civ (Neutral or Guarded), to an outright declaration of war (Guarded or Hostile).
In Rising Tide, things are done totally different, nothing listed above in this section happening. A player's respect level will drop if a covert agent is caught. Surprisingly depending on the personality traits an AI opponent chooses, an AI player's respect levels may increase if the human player performs more covert operations
Rising Tide.
Players receive one extra agent from completion of the REACTIVE quest, when they get the Culper Lodge. Despite what it says, players can complete a covert operation one level less than it says they need, and players will complete the quest. This may only be for the ARC.
Players get new agents the same as before, with the maximum of nine. [Chungsu%20%28CivBE%29](Chungsu) who starts with one extra so it can get a maximum of 10.
Personality Traits and Tradeable Agreements.
Personality Traits
AI players with these traits will respect they player more if they engage in more covert operations.
Tradeable Agreements
Black Market.
In Rising Tide, players can assign an agent to trade for Strategic Resources. An agent's rank increases the number of resources one can gain and decreases the cost they pay for these resources.
