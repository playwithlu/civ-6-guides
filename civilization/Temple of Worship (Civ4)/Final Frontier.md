Civilopedia entry.
The community created by religion has been an important part of human society since times long past. This need for community was only heightened as man came face to face with the stunning isolation of empty space or uninhabited planetscapes. The Temples of Worship, acting as centers of community and spirituality, filled this longing need, allowing those stranded among the stars to create a new home and a new sense of happiness.
