# Initiation Rites (Civ6)

Initiation Rites is a [Pantheon%20%28Civ6%29](Pantheon) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". Whenever a player with this pantheon clears a [Barbarian%20%28Civ6%29%23Outposts](Barbarian Outpost), that player receives +50 . In "", it was altered to fully heal the [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](unit) that clears the outpost as well.
Strategy.
Initiation Rites is not a terribly useful pantheon at the beginning of the game, and its use tapers off rapidly: the more [Territory%20%28Civ6%29](territory) [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) and [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-states) claim, the harder it becomes to find Barbarian Outposts, and it's not worth the trouble to send units to the poles to clear outposts for a mere 50 in the later [Era%20%28Civ6%29](eras) (though the reward can be as much as 150 on Marathon [Speed%20%28Civ6%29](game speed)). Still, it could help when trying to earn enough to patronize an important early on, and if the better pantheons (like [Stone%20Circles%20%28Civ6%29](Stone Circles)) have already been taken.
This pantheon is decent for the [Sumerian%20%28Civ6%29](Sumerians), since they have strong incentives to seek out Barbarian Outposts. Its healing bonus can keep their [War-Cart%20%28Civ6%29](War-Carts) healthy when defeating Barbarian Outposts to reap [Tribal%20Village%20%28Civ6%29](Tribal Village) rewards aplenty. However, the challenge of being able to reliably locate Barbarian Outposts (which is not a guarantee) and the decline in relevancy of this pantheon remains the same.
