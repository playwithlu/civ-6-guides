# Stockpile Energy (SMAC)

 is a [base%20facility%20%28SMAC%29](base facility) in "[Sid%20Meier%27s%20Alpha%20Centauri](Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri)".
Strategy.
Convert minerals to energy. This is rarely a good idea in the beginning of the game, because your production capacity is far too valuable for building vitally necessary base facilities and units. But by the latter half of the game, many of your bases will have built all of the facilities that they need. Those bases whose production capacity is too low to produce units quickly may well do better stockpiling energy.
