Unit Analysis.
Artillery is the final unit in the ranged land weapons lineage, which includes the [Catapult%20%28CivRev%29](Catapult) and the [Cannon%20%28CivRev%29](Cannon). Like its predecessors, it has very high attack power and very low [Defense%20%28CivRev%29](defense), so keeping it well-protected with infantry is prudent.
