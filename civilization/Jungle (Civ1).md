# Jungle (Civ1)

These areas of forest and dense jungle produce relatively poor amounts of [Food%20%28Civ1%29](food) and no [Production%20%28Civ1%29](resources). But they can be made much more valuable by conversion into either [Grassland%20%28Civ1%29](Grasslands) or [Forest%20%28Civ1%29](Forests). For this reason, the long term potential of a city site containing several Jungles is good.
Jungles produce 1 food. [Gems%20%28Civ1%29](Gems) can be found in Jungles which generate an extra 4 trade.
It costs 2 Movement Points to travel over a Jungle region.
Jungles offer a +50% defense bonus.
