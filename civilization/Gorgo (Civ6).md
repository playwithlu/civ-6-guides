In-Game.

In "", against her will decay at twice the usual rate.
Her [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader ability) is Thermopylae. It provides her with equal to 50% of the base Combat Strength of each enemy military [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](unit) defeated, and her units with +1 Combat Strength for every active Military [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](policy card) in her [Government%20%28Civ6%29](government).
Detailed Approach.

Coupled with a free Wildcard Policy slot, Greece is the government power player throughout the game. Researching the civics that boost their victory strategy, they will have a full slate of Policies in place to help them along the way.
