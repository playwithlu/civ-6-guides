# Hit Movies (Civ4)

Hit Movies, like [Hit%20Singles%20%28Civ4%29](Hit Singles) and [Hit%20Musicals%20%28Civ4%29](Hit Musicals) and unlike other resources, cannot be obtained by improving a tile. Instead, the owner of the [Hollywood%20%28Civ4%29](Hollywood) wonder obtains a certain number based on the map size. Other players must trade with them or conquer the wonder to get it.
Strategy.
As the owner of the Hollywood wonder has a monopoly on this resource and controls who does or doesn't have it, it's great for a builder playing the diplomatic game.
Providing AI leaders with resources boosts their relations to you, which helps reduce the risk of war. If they decide to go to war with you anyway, they'll take a happiness hit from losing the resource. The risk of a happiness hit could also help put other players off trying to attack you in multiplayer, though you'd likely need a monopoly on all three resources for it to be significant enough.
As with the other "Hit" resources, [Roosevelt%20%28Civ4%29](Roosevelt) is a very good leader to aim for the attached wonders due to [American%20%28Civ4%29](America's) unique building boosting their effectiveness and Roosevelt being an Industrious leader.
