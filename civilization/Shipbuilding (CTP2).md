Great Library entry.
Boats made of animal skin sewn over a skeletal frame of wood or bone were developed and widely used by ancient peoples in Asia, Africa, the British Isles, Europe and the plains of North America from as far back as 16,000 BC. Well suited to lakes, streams and shallow oceans, these boats were used mainly for fishing and light transport. Many skin boats were unsuitable for open sea travel, as the violence of the open seas was too much for their frail construction to bear. They were easy to repair, though, and could be built from a wide range of available materials. They were preferred by societies who either had limited access to timber to build wooden boats, or lacked the tools necessary to cut and manipulate large timber.
