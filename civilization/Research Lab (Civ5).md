# Research Lab (Civ5)

Game Info.
Advanced science building. Requires [Public%20School%20%28Civ5%29](Public School).
Strategy.
The Research Laboratory is the top-tier science building, providing a final boost for researching the most sophisticated (and -intensive) [List%20of%20technologies%20in%20Civ5](technologies) in the final [Era%20%28Civ5%29](eras). The city must already possess a Public School to construct the Research Laboratory. All players should build it at some point in the late game, but those pursuing a [Science%20victory%20%28Civ5%29](science victory) should aim at acquiring it as soon as possible. As usual, build it first in your most scientific cities for an immediate boost in research capabilities, then gradually in the rest of your empire.
