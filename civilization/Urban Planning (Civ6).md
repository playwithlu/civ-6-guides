Urban Planning is an Economic [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
This is one of the starting Economic Policy choices and is great for an overall boost to [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) , enabling you to mobilize [Military%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](military units) to handle [Barbarian%20%28Civ6%29](Barbarian) incursions and create [Settler%20%28Civ6%29](Settlers) and [Builder%20%28Civ6%29](Builders) to facilitate early expansion. However, if your is blessed with [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles) that provide extra (e.g., [Plains%20%28Civ6%29](Plains) and [Hills%20%28Civ6%29](Hills)), it may be more practical to use [God%20King%20%28Civ6%29](God King) for monetary and spiritual gain. 
Note that Urban Planning works for all cities and purposes, unlike God King, and may turn out to be invaluable for boosting newly-founded cities from your first expansion effort.
Urban Planning is made [obsolete](obsolete) with [The%20Enlightenment%20%28Civ6%29](The Enlightenment), which doesn't offer a direct replacement. If you have numerous small or low- cities, it may be worth holding off researching The Enlightenment for a short time in order to keep this policy slotted while your small cities develop. Players seeking a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Domination](Domination Victory), however, should not pursue this strategy, as they can capture fully-developed cities and need The Enlightenment in order to reach advanced military [Civic%20%28Civ6%29](civics) like [Nationalism%20%28Civ6%29](Nationalism). Once it is obsolete, policies that benefit Builders can make a good replacement.
