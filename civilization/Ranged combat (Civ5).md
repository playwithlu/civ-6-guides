# Ranged combat (Civ5)

Some [Unit%20%28Civ5%29](units') weapons allow them to attack the enemies from far enough away that they're unable to retaliate. When they shoot, the enemy can do nothing but cower in fear. This is ranged combat.
There are both land and [Naval%20units%20%28Civ5%29](naval units) capable of ranged combat. For a complete list, see [%23Ranged%20attackers](below).
Ranged units statistics.
Any unit that can engage in ranged combat has some special statistics:
Rules of engagement for ranged units.
Line of sight.
Generally, a ranged unit must be able to "see" its target in order to be able to fire at it (with the exception of units with the Indirect Fire [Promotions%20%28Civ5%29](promotion)). A unit cannot see a target if a blocking [Terrain%20%28Civ5%29](terrain) object is between the two - a [Mountain%20%28Civ5%29](mountain) or [Hill%20%28Civ5%29](hill), for example, or a [Forest%20%28Civ5%29](forest) tile. A unit can always see into adjacent tiles, even if it contains blocking terrain, but it cannot see objects in tiles past the blocking terrain. Note that flying units can see over blocking terrain, because of their vantage point. Also, units on hills often have a high enough vantage point to see over blocking terrain - the only exception is if the blocking terrain itself is on hills.
Finally, individual sight radius may also affect the ability to attack. Most ranged units' sight radius is at least equal to their range, which allows them to always use their full range to attack. A notable exception are siege units, which usually have a sight radius of 1 and a range of at least 2. Thus, for example, a [Catapult%20%28Civ5%29](Catapult) left on its own won't be able to use its full range, because it won't be able to see far enough. However, if the Catapult has a line of sight to a tile seen by another unit, it will be able to attack that tile as long as it's within range.
Attacking.
A ranged unit may attack any unit within its range with impunity. The attacking unit's Ranged Combat Strength is compared to the target's Combat Strength, bonuses are applied, and the damage the target suffers is determined. If the target is destroyed, the tile where it was remains unoccupied.
Note that when applying bonuses related to terrain, the tile of the target is what determines them. For example, an Accuracy promotion bonus will only work if the target is on flat terrain, while a Bombardment bonus will only work if the target is in rough terrain. Defensive terrain bonuses also apply for the target, and the attacking unit may not use any Formation bonuses.
Defending.
When a ranged unit is attacked by a melee unit, the stat used for comparison with the enemy's attack is Combat Strength. As a rule, ranged units have weaker Combat Strength than Ranged Combat Strength, which automatically makes them more vulnerable when attacked. Make sure to take this into account!
On the other hand, when a ranged unit is attacked by ranged unit or enemy's city, the stat used for comparison with the enemy's ranged attack is Ranged Combat Strength.
Ranged attacks allow your army to deal damage without endangering themselves. They are an essential part of your army from the very beginning to the end of the game. Make sure to learn how to use them well, and defend them.
