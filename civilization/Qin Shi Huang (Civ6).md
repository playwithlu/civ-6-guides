Qin Shi Huang (18 February 259 – 10 September 210 BC), born Ying Zheng, was the first and the founder of the . Originally the king of the , he put an end to the through a series of that led to the unification of China. He leads the [Chinese%20%28Civ6%29](Chinese) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Qin is the first among emperors and therefore he needs to be first in amazing [Wonder%20%28Civ6%29](wonders) built for his legacy.
This is the standard version of Qin Shi Huang when players do not have the [Rulers%20of%20China%20Pack%20%28Civ6%29](Rulers of China Pack) enabled. When it is enabled, Qin Shi Huang will be split into two alternate [Persona%20%28Civ6%29](personas): [Qin%20Shi%20Huang%20%28Civ6%29/Unifier](Unifier Qin Shi Huang), with a new appearance and abilities; and Mandate of Heaven Qin Shi Huang, using his former model and abilities.
Intro.
 In your people lies your greatest strength, Emperor Qin Shi Huang. From all over the world, others will come to gaze upon the great walls and towering wonders of your united China. May the hands of your men never blister as they work hard and fast to raise the most impressive structures that the world will ever know. Protect them well, and you will forever be immortalized.
In-Game.
Qin Shi Huang's unique [Agenda%20%28Civ6%29](agenda) is Wall of 10,000 Li. He dislikes leaders who have built more wonders than he built.
His [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader ability) is The First Emperor. His [Builder%20%28Civ6%29](Builders) receive an additional build charge, and can spend one of their charges to pay 15% of the cost for [Ancient%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Ancient) and [Classical%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Classical) wonders. In "", he can also build [Canal%20%28Civ6%29](Canals) after researching [Masonry%20%28Civ6%29](Masonry).
Detailed Approach.
China is the ultimate in isolationist, builder civilizations. Qin can mobilize a more productive workforce than any other leader, and early in the game his Builders can use their charges directly on his beloved wonders. Once in possession of those wonders, their gunpowder weaponry and [Great%20Wall%20%28Civ6%29](Great Wall) should help them hang onto the land and wonders they have developed. With the Dynastic Cycle ability, they will gain even more from [Boost%20%28Civ6%29](boosts). If they are able to achieve many of these added pushes, their progress through both progression trees should be swift.
Lines.
Qin Shi Huang is voiced by [Junchao%20Huang](Junchao Huang). He speaks , though he utilizes the vocabulary and grammar reserved for scholars and government officials in Ancient Imperial China.
Notably, Qin Shi Huang uses the pronoun "寡人" ("guǎ rén") to address himself (instead of "朕" ("zhèn"), the personal pronoun reserved for emperors), even though this pronoun was used by vassal kings, such as Qin Shi Huang himself before he became the emperor of China. According to "", Qin Shi Huang used "朕" ("zhèn") for 9 years, from 221 to 212 BCE, then changed to "真人" ("zhēn rén", a term very closely related to Taoism) due to his obsession with seeking immortality, shortly before his death in 210 BCE.
