# Worker (CTP2)

Gameplay.
Workers represent the total labor potential of citizens in a {{LinkCTP2|City}}. In a {{LinkCTP2|City}}, there is a Worker unit for each level of {{LinkCTP2|Population}}. The bigger the {{LinkCTP2|City}}, the more Workers there are, the more resources they produce. Workers are invisible to the player, in the sense that one cannot assign them to specific tiles. They can, however, be reassigned to be {{LinkCTP2|Specialists}}.
