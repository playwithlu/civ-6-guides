# Catapult (CivRev)

The Catapult is a ranged unit in "[Civilization%20Revolution](Civilization Revolution)".
Unit Analysis.
The Catapult is the first artillery unit in the game. Like all other combat units, 3 of them can be formed up into an [Army%20%28CivRev%29](Army), and like all artillery types, its attack is much greater than its [Defense%20%28CivRev%29](defense). This makes it very good at attacking [City%20%28CivRev%29](cities), especially when in an Army or with upgrades or both.
Unless it is stacked with a defensive unit like an [Archer%20%28CivRev%29](Archer) or [Pikemen%20%28CivRev%29](Pikemen), the Catapult is "very" vulnerable to attack. Unlike in "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)", units "can" be stacked together to maximize defense, so taking advantage of this feature is essential if you want to keep your artillery alive.
Unique Replacements.
[French%20%28CivRev%29](French) Catapults are replaced by the Trebuchet. It is identical to the unit it replaces.
