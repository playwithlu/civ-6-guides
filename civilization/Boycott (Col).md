# Boycott (Col)

Periodically, the King will arbitrarily raise your taxes.
If you wish to protest the increase you can hold a "party" in which whatever [goods](goods) are named in the dialogue will be thrown away. It tends to be whatever goods you have the most of on hand at the time. This initiates a boycott of those goods. Your tax rate will not increase "this time", and you cannot buy or sell them in [Europe](Europe) without paying a large penalty in [gold%20%28Col%29](gold). The historical significance of this should be obvious, but from a game economy standpoint, it is probably a greater hindrance than benefit.
[Jakob%20Fugger%20%28Col%29](Jakob Fugger) can be very helpful in eliminating boycotts.
