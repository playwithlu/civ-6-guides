# Apprenticeship (Civ6)

Apprenticeship is a [Medieval%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Medieval Era) [Technology%20%28Civ6%29](technology) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It can be hurried by building any three [Mine%20%28Civ6%29](Mines).
Strategy.
Apprenticeship is one of the most important technologies of the middle game! Besides improving the performance of one of the most widely used improvements (the Mine), it gives access to a universally-necessary [District%20%28Civ6%29](district), the [Industrial%20Zone%20%28Civ6%29](Industrial Zone) (and its special [Buildings%20%28Civ6%29](building), the [Workshop%20%28Civ6%29](Workshop)), which will have multiple uses in the future (besides boosting one of the most universal types of [Great%20People%20%28Civ6%29](Great People), the [Great%20Engineer%20%28Civ6%29](Great Engineer)). But even if you're not truly the economic type, and prefer military development, you will still need Apprenticeship in order to reach the next-gen military units of the middle game. This tech is a gateway to the entire central-lower part of the tech tree. 
Even better, Apprenticeship can be beelined relatively easily - it requires [Horseback%20Riding%20%28Civ6%29](Horseback Riding) and [Currency%20%28Civ6%29](Currency), both of which are researched rather naturally in Turns 50â€“80. And the for Apprenticeship is ridiculously easy to activate, making it an easy choice for a first Medieval tech. [Gallic%20%28Civ6%29](Gallic) players will have an easier time attaining Apprenticeship since the tech is automatically awarded when they build their unique district, the [Oppidum%20%28Civ6%29](Oppidum), available with [Iron%20Working%20%28Civ6%29](Iron Working).
