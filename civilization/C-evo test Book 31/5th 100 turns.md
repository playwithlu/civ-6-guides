Japs have done no sea exploration nor found any American cities, but they have a tank across the border looking for one.

We have built 21 of the new infantry (44/176) and not lost a single one. Isolated cities can still build them, but our much stronger marines (272/272) will gradually take over from them. They will significantly augment the still useful but now weaker howitzers (220/44/2.5) and our strongest unrestricted defenders, the old infantry (124/93).

MIR Space Station:
All is revealed.
457. 2057.
Borsippa [9] (far to the south of what was Corinth) has Cobalt, but we might do better setting up on East Island north-east of Alba Longa. Nanjing [12] (across sea east of Byblus) has Mercury but we have our own. Changchun (as already noted, far to the west of Neapolis) has Uranium, and might be a better target than trying to re-establish near old Corinth (PS, as you will read below, our first attempt with two Battle Ships and seven alpine marines failed after half a dozen turns; but we will have much stronger forces if we go there again).
We (popn 146, territory 522, tech 95%) have 14 marines (272/272, overweight), 15 infantry (44/176, overweight), 6 howitzer (220/44/2.5), 7 infantry (124/93), 8 Battle Ship (248/496, *7.5), 1 Destroyer (184/368, *6.5, about to be recycled) (* includes Magellan)
British (popn 724 - they have been top since about 1750; territory 1910; tech 64%) have 184 Infantry (64/96) (some fanatic), 150 howitzer (128/32), 55 cavalry (50/25/2.5), 86 riflemen (50/50), 14 dragoons (48/16/2.5), 7 ironclad (368/184/4.5), 30 transport (0/276/4.5), 9 galleon (64/32/3.5), and sundries. Lots of transport east from south China to Egypt and north from Babylon etc. to the Byblus Peninsula. Nearest transport to Alba and Izumo is at Babylon. Their military technology includes Mobile Warfare, Automobile, Steel, Amphibious Warfare, Magnetism, Explosives, Tactics, but no Mass Production, Democracy, Radio, Flight, Electricity; they are researching The Republic. Between Alba Longa and Byblus there are about 60 foot units and probably several hidden howitzers. Alba Longa just needs lots of very strong defenders (with the occasional Battle Ship patrol)!!
Americans (popn 68, territory 218, tech 69%) have 7 missile launchers (215/54/2.5), 7 marines (108/162), 4 riflemen (31/93), 2 tanks (93/62/2.5), no ships. We should try to capture and use their cities. They are threatening British Nagoya, which is great, but we can start at their north-west end.
Egyptians (popn 8, territory 50, tech 68%) have 1 tank, 1 rifleman, 1 ironclad; Alexandria is likely to fall within 10 turns. Our ships could be very well placed to play major role in taking it over.
Japanese (popn 15, territory 94, tech 60%) have 3 riflemen. Recently annoying the Americans and seem not to interest the British.
We need a stronger ground unit that is not overweight.

No allies left.
481. 2081.
Japanese gone.
Material Technology 5 &gt; MT6 (though we could have gone for a mobile 472/354 ground unit - almost as much defense as the latest overweights)

Puzzle: hardened Battle Ship attack strength 248 i.e. when undamaged is 372 but reduce by 6% to 350; tries to attack an American hardened marine 108/162 on a prairie, who should have a defense value of 243, but I get the mysterious suicide diagram that has 243 at top, 372 at left, 94 at bottom, and 100 at right. Why is 350 v 243 suicide?
487. 2087.
4th lot of marines (holding machine gun at waist - SAME picture as the alpine marines) 256/384/2.0, arty; cost 189 (line). Research recycling.
Tarquinia starts building 4th marines (but the first will be six or more turns coming unless we incorporate oldies). Ostia continues with the alpine marines for now; we should assemble them (veteran or elite if possible) for a wave attack on America when we have enough newbies to follow up.
Tarracina [11]: 3+69+(36-2;21+162)
