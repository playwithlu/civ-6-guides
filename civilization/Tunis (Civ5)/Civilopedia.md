# Tunis (Civ5)/Civilopedia

Founded by Berbers in the 2nd millennium BC, the town of Tunes was destroyed by the Romans in 146 BC during their wars with Carthage. Although rebuilt and occupied by the Romans, Tunis would not gain prominence until the 7th Century AD under the control of Arab Muslims. Recognizing the strategic importance of its proximity to Europe, from the 900s on it became the primary naval base in the western Mediterranean of successive Islamic dynasties. Following yet another revolt, the Almohad al-Mumin took the city in 1159 and established it as a trading center; from the 12th through the 16th centuries, Tunis was one of the richest and most strategic ports in the world. The Ottoman Empire took nominal control of Tunis in 1534 AD; after a brief Spanish occupation ended in 1574, the Ottoman governors there became relatively autonomous. Under the Husainid rulers, to its traditional trade and industry was added the plunder of the Barbary corsairs, then at their peak of activity. After a succession of rebellions, invasions and occupations, the French ruled the area from 1881 through 1956. Gaining its independence, Tunis has been the capital city of Tunisia since the French withdrawal, a cosmopolitan center of trade and culture for the region.
