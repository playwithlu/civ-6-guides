# Mine (Civ5)/Civilopedia

Mines are among the most important improvements in Civilization V. Not only do they increase a hex's productivity output - and high productivity allows quicker construction of units, buildings, and wonders - but they also provide access to some of the most important resources in the game: iron, coal, and uranium, to name a few.
