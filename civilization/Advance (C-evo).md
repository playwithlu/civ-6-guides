# Advance (C-evo)

Prerequisites.
With a few exceptions, each advance can be researched only after you have researched the two others specified for it, unless you get a start from another nation (by negotiation - or if you have the [Temple%20of%20Zeus%20%28C-evo%29](Temple of Zeus) active then by conquest) or the [Great%20Library%20%28C-evo%29](Great Library).
Costs.
Research costs science "beakers", the numbers determined by a complicated formula based on your class of [difficulty%20level%20%28C-evo%29](difficulty level).
- where n is initially 4 and increases by 2 or 1 for each advance discovered or acquired
Early Advances.
Others dependent on earlier advances.
There are 29 others listed in the first group in the manual; each requires the prior discovery of one or two other specified advances. Most of the names will be familiar to players of "Civ" games, but there are significant differences to watch.
When invited to select an advance, you have the option to "Focus" on one of the 29 that is not currently available. You are then presented with a menu that excludes advance(s) not necessary to reach your goal.
Industrial Age Advances.
Every one of the next group except [Science%20%28C-evo%29](Science) has Science, a "Key Technology", as one of its prerequisites (directly or indirectly). 
Science itself has three prerequisites - [Metallurgy%20%28C-evo%29](Metallurgy), [Philosophy%20%28C-evo%29](Philosophy), and [Theology%20%28C-evo%29](Theology), but only two are required. The discovery of Science makes a number of additional bonus tiles visible and usable. They include bauxite, coal, manganese, oil, and diamonds; see .
The science-dependent advances number 32. You may focus on any one of them that isn't visible, as for the earlier group.
Modern Advances.
Key Technology for group three is [Mass%20Production](Mass Production), which also requires two out of three specified prerequisites: [Automobile%20%28C-evo%29](Automobile), The [Corporation%20%28C-evo%29](Corporation), and [Electronics%20%28C-evo%29](Electronics).
Discovering Mass Production lets you see which of the apparently [dead%20land%20%28C-evo%29](dead land)s actually conceal rare minerals vital for winning the game.
In addition to Mass Production, there are 19 "Modern Advances".
Future Technologies.
There are four sets of advances classed as "Future Technologies". Each can be researched in 25 or more stages, each stage taking four times as long as a normal advance. Each adds a percentage to something, such as [weapon%20%28C-evo%29](weapon) strength or city productivity. You cannot get them from another [nation%20%28C-evo%29](nation) or the [Great%20Library%20%28C-evo%29](Great Library).
Focus at higher levels.
Both the Modern and the Future advances may be the subject of a focus as soon as you have Mass Production.
