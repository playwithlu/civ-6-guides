# SS Component (Civ1)

[Spaceship%20%28Civ1%29](Spaceship) Components have a mass of 400 tons each and a spaceship may include a maximum of eight of each type.
Civilopedia entry.
The Components provide the motive power of your spaceship. There are two types: Propulsion and Fuel. Propulsion Components are the spaceship engines, providing the acceleration and deceleration needed for the journey. Fuel Components are supplies of fuel, each sufficient for one Propulsion Component. The minimum a spaceship requires is one of each Component, but to arrive at the best speed, it requires many more of both.
