# Fusilier (Civ3)/Civilopedia

The first Prussian Fusilier units were comprised of artillery-trained soldiers armed with flintlock "fusils" that
did not need a burning match, thus reducing the danger of accidental powder explosions. Fusiliers were converted
into regular line infantry when the flintlock musket became standard issue. In the Prussian army, Fusiliers were
often considered second-rate soldiers, culled from the youngest and least trained.
