The following are lists of units in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)" and its expansions.
Combat.
All [Military%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](military units) can initiate [Combat%20%28Civ6%29](combat) and defend. Land military units occupy the land combat layer in the game, while naval military units occupy the naval combat layer and air units occupy two distinct air layers: an air combat layer and aerodrome layer. Within each combat layer, only one unit can occupy each [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tile). When embarked, land combat units occupy an embarked layer along with civilian and support units. They cannot initiate attacks against naval units or other embarked units while embarked but can defend. [Nuclear%20weapons%20%28Civ6%29](Nuclear weapons) cannot be deployed as military units and operate uniquely.
Support Units.
Support units can be destroyed by hostile enemy units when undefended by military units. Additionally, some military units can use priority targeting to damage support units even when they are defended by a military unit.
