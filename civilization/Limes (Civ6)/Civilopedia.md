# Limes (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Limites (the plural of limes) delineated the fortified frontiers of the Roman Empire, signified by fortified cities and military outposts. Hadrian’s Wall was often referred to as the Limes Britannicus; the far eastern edge facing the desert was the Limes Arabicus … the Limes Germanicus, Limes Alutanus, etc., etc. The military bases of the limites were designated as castra (fortresses of the legions) and castella (bases guarded by auxiliaries, usually local native infantry). Although the empire always looked to its defenses, the period between 40 and 280 AD was the highpoint of building limes. Indeed, Roman writers of the time presented the limites as a sort of sacred border beyond which civilized people did not go.
