# Zero (CTP2)

The Zero Fighter is a unit that is found in "[Call%20to%20Power%20II](Call to Power II)" when playing the World War II global mod pack. These planes were used in the attack on Pearl Harbor in the start of the scenario. The [Japanese%20%28CTP2%29](Japanese) Zero was known to be a very formidable aircraft during [World%20War%20II%20era%20%28CTP2%29](World War II). These airplanes are faster and can fly for longer durations then their Allied counterparts. They also get a higher defense bonus because the planes were so fast in speed. If you're playing as the Japanese, your goal should be to use these planes to conquer a huge swath of territory from British India all the way to Timor sea to the border Australia. If you conquer and hold as much territory as in real life then the player of the Japanese civilization will have enough victory points to win World War II. Victory points are assigned based on cities captured and number of cities held.
