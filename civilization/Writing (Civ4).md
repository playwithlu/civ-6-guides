Strategy.
Writing enables you to build [Library%20%28Civ4%29](Libraries), which boost research. It also allows you to sign the 'Open Borders' diplomatic agreement with other civilizations. Having Open Borders with rivals improves diplomatic relations with them and enables you to explore their land.
