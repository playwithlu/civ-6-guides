# Hanse (Civ5)

Game Info.
[Unique%20building%20%28Civ5%29](Unique building) of the [German%20%28Civ5%29](German) [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilization). Requires [Market%20%28Civ5%29](Market). Replaces the [Bank%20%28Civ5%29](Bank).
Strategy.
The Hanse has the same bonuses as a Bank, and in addition the Hanse provides for each [Trade%20route%20%28Civ5%29](Trade Route) within your empire that connects to a [City-state%20%28Civ5%29](City-State). The Trade Routes can come from any combination of [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities), even cities without the Hanse. Only Germany may build it.
This effect nicely completes the main battle focus of the Germans, rewarding the civilization for opening Trade Routes with City-States instead of with other civilizations. After all, when you're at war with half the world, you can only trade with City-States!
