Alexander the Great is a [List%20of%20scenarios%20in%20CTP2](scenario) in "[Call%20to%20Power%20II](Call to Power II)".
Description.
This is your chance to equal or even surpass the incredible accomplishments of Alexander the Great. What would have happened if he had lived longer, conquered other lands or secured an heir? Would his dream of a peaceful world empire have been realized? Now, you can find out.
Intro.
It is May, 334 B.C. You are Alexander, King of Macedonia. You stand on the shores of Asia, ready to plunge into the Persian Empire. Your father Philip forged Macedonia into a powerful nation, but died before he could invade Persia. His death left you king at only 21 years of age. He also left you with a veteran army ready for anything.
You have spent two years consolidating your power, and now its time to continue where your father Philip left off. Persia is a shadow of its former glory, but still you will be like a fly attacking an elephant. The odds are against you, but the world has never seen anyone with your talent and potential.
Your armies await you to the South and Southeast, ready to invade Persia at your command. Before you launch your invasion, it is recommended you read the reports in the Great Library on Macedonia, Persia, and your other neighboring countries. Also be sure to familiarize yourself with the special rules of this scenario.
Scenario Rules.
Victory Points.
Your performance in this game is rated through a point based objective system. You can earn up to 60 Victory Points in the game. You gain Victory Points for three things:
1) Raise an heir to be old enough to take on the leadership of the Macedonians after your death. After finding a wife and giving birth to a son, you will earn a Victory Point for each year your son lives, up until the son reaches the age of 12, at which point you will get a 5 point bonus.
2) Destroy or ally with civilizations. You get a Victory Point for each civilization in the game you've destroyed or allied with. Note that the Persians and Independent civilizations hate you fiercely and will not ally with you under any circumstances. You can also earn two Victory Points if all 13 of the great Barbarian Leaders are found and eliminated.
3) Conquer and hold key cities, which include Syracuse, Tarentum, Carthage, Rome, Athens, Corinth, Pella, Sparta, Ephesus, Halicarnassus, Cyene, Memphis, Tyre, Salamis, Thapsacus, Tarsus, Sinope, Babylon, Susa, Ecbatana, Persepolis, Baktra, Aornus, Marakanda, Roruka, Pattala, Taksasila, Sakala, Ujjayini, Suvarnagiri, Kausambi, Mathura, Pataliputra, Tamralipti, Marib and Shabwah. You get a Victory Point for each of these cities that you or your Allies hold at the end of the game.
Veteran Effect.
At the beginning of each turn, every unit who shares the same square as Alexander or Darius will gain Veteran status for the rest of that turn.
New Units.
A number of new units have been added including the Elephant Warrior, Longbow Archer, Horseman, Catamaran, War Coracle, Trireme, Phalanx, Alexander, Darius, and the Generals. You can see their statistics and description in the Units section of the Great Library. The abilities of certain units familiar from the normal game, such as the Warrior, are slightly boosted.
Time Index.
Each turn represents one month. Science, Production and Growth have been slowed to accomodate this. Researching a technology is 10 times slower, and tile improvements, units and buildings cost roughly 5 to 10 times more than usual, and cities grow at 1/10th of the usual rate.
Movement.
Due to the greater detail of the map, unit movement is doubled. No unit can travel across Polar Mountain terrain. Units that cannot travel across Mountain terrain cannot move across Sand Dunes either.
Trade Goods.
Some trade goods are located on different terrain types than usual. Hills have Rubies, Diamonds and Emeralds. Elephants are found in Jungles. Jade can be found on Mountains. And coffee, tea and some other goods haven't been commercially used yet.
Units and Buildings.
Some units and buildings can only be built in certain cities. For instance, Elephant Warriors can only be built in Indian cities and Hoplites are only available in ethnically Greek cities. The exception to this is if you found a new city. New Cities can build any type of unit. However, you cannot build Settlers and will only receive them through special events.
