# Electronics (Civ3)

Trivia.
Before , an intermediate advance [Radio%20%28Civ3%29](Radio) was required to be researched before moving on to [Advanced%20Flight%20%28Civ3%29](Advanced Flight) now this technology leads directly there. Radio was simply a prerequisite advance that unlocked nothing else except the ability to research Advanced Flight.
