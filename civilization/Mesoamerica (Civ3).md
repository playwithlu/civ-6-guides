Description.
The Mesoamerican cultures of the Pre-Columbian era have captured the imagination of anthropologists and historians alike. From the industrious Inca and their imperial road system, to the magnificant temples of Mayan Tikal, and on into central Mexico where the mighty Aztecs paid blood homage to the god-king Quetzalcoatl, these cultures stood as a testament to the ingenuity and glory of ancient man. Can you, as either the Aztecs, the Maya, or the Inca, lead your people to victory, and forge an empire to withstand the coming of the Conquistadors?
Intro.
Background.
The date is 300 AD, the beginning of the Classic Age of Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. Many cultures live within the lush and mountainous regions of Mexico, Central and South America. Some are on the rise, while others fight to stave off their inevitable decay. Yet all share common traits: the worship of the jaguar and the feathered-serpent, the building of grand temples of limestone and granite, the capture and enslavement of enemy soldiers, and the giving of thanks to the gods through human sacrifice. These traits and more dominate the scene as the sun rises and sets on your bountiful lands. But unbeknownst to all, a pale flame smoulders in the east, and when it begins its steady rage westward, its embers will cook your salty beaches and tear asunder your mighty thrones... "or will it?"
Special.
This scenario opens with three civilizations on the rise: The Maya, the Aztecs, and the Inca. Three others are in decline: The Olmecs, the Toltecs, and the Moche. 
Victory.
Victory is achieved either through acquiring enough "culture" for a Cultural Victory, "or" by gaining 35% of the terrain "and" 50% of the population. Otherwise, the winner is the side with the highest score at game end (1500 AD; 175 turns). 
Notes.
(1) "The Amazon Rainforest" - All forest spaces east of the Andes Mountains are impassable "rainforest"; (2) "Jungle" - Jungle terrain does not cause disease; (3) "Ritual Sacrifice" - An "enslaved" enemy unit can be delivered to a friendly city and "sacrificed" for Culture Points. For details, see the "Ritual Sacrifice" rule in the Civilopedia.
