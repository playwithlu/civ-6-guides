# Monarchy (Civ6)

Monarchy is a form of Tier 2 [Government%20%28Civ6%29](government) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is unlocked by the [Divine%20Right%20%28Civ6%29](Divine Right) [Civic%20%28Civ6%29](civic).
In ', this government's legacy bonus is conferred by Monarchic Legacy, a Wildcard [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](policy) unlocked by changing governments after adopting Monarchy and constructing a Tier 2 government [Building%20%28Civ6%29](building) ([Foreign%20Ministry%20%28Civ6%29](Foreign Ministry), [Grand%20Master%27s%20Chapel%20%28Civ6%29](Grand Master's Chapel), [Intelligence%20Agency%20%28Civ6%29](Intelligence Agency), or [Queen%27s%20Bibliotheque%20%28Civ6%29](Queen's Bibliotheque)).
Strategy.
Monarchy is a balanced government thanks to its bonuses and policy card layout. It has the most {{WildcardPolicy6}} Wildcard policy slots out of any Tier 2 government, so if you aren't specifically focusing on [Religion%20%28Civ6%29](religion) or trade, you're usually safest picking this government. In fact, if you aren't wanting to slot more policy cards, Monarchy may remain viable well after it is unlocked, since it provides greatly relevant bonuses to a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Diplomacy](Diplomatic Victory). [Georgian%20%28Civ6%29](Georgia) is a [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) that can reap great benefits from this government, since they have both a [Tsikhe%20%28Civ6%29](Renaissance Wall replacement) and [Diplomacy%20%28Civ6%29](diplomatic) bonuses.
