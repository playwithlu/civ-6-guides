# Berber Cavalry (Civ5)/Civilopedia

Inhabiting the Magreb for centuries, the fierce Berber warriors were masters of the Rif Mountains and the western Sahara Desert. Typically Berber riders were mounted on Barb horses, a North African breed of exceptional hardiness. Berber warriors wore light clothing suited to the heat and dry climate, augmented by robes in the winter. Their weaponry was adapted from that of the Arabs: a long straight sword, a curved and ornamented dagger, and a long-barrel firearm (smoothbore or rifled). Although raiding caravans and coastal settlements was common, Berber cavalrymen were not adverse to conventional battle - having proved their worth against the heavy, armored European knights in several conflicts.
