# Slave (CTP2)

Gameplay.
Slaves are {{LinkCTP2|Workers}} who do not enjoy the benefit of citizenship. They are prisoners, in a sense, forced to work in a foreign {{LinkCTP2|city}} for no pay. Slaves only eat half of the {{LinkCTP2|Food}} of standard {{LinkCTP2|Workers}}.
An empire can only acquire slaves by sending {{LinkCTP2|Slavers}} on slave raids in neighboring empires. The act of enslaving others is seen as a grave offense and may enrage other nations.
