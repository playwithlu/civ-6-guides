# Nuclear Plant (Civ5)

Game Info.
Advanced power plant. Requires a [Factory%20%28Civ5%29](Factory); city must not contain a [Solar%20Plant%20%28Civ5%29](Solar Plant).
Strategy.
The Nuclear Plant is a top-level -boosting building, providing a whopping increase in productivity necessary for constructing all those late game [Unit%20%28Civ5%29](units) and buildings. However, it takes 1 resource to work, reducing the amount available for [Nuclear%20weapons%20%28Civ5%29](nukes) and [Giant%20Death%20Robot%20%28Civ5%29](Giant Death Robots), so military-oriented empires should be careful with constructing too many Nuclear Plants, lest they run out of for their army.
A Nuclear Plant can't coexist with the ecology-oriented [Solar%20Plant%20%28Civ5%29](Solar Plant).
