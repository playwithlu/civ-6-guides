# Imperialism (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Imperialism is a governmental organization wherein a country extends its rule or authority over foreign
countries, or of acquiring and holding colonies and dependencies. Imperial governments have played a pivotal
role over the long course of human history. Some of the most notable Imperial governments were the Romans of
ancient times, the French under Napoleon, and the British Colonial Empire of the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries
(an empire so vast that the phrase “The Sun Never Set on the British Empire” was coined to reflect its size).
