Strategy.
With higher Ranged Strength than the Archer and a bonus against wounded units, the Hul'che is similar to the [P%C3%ADtati%20Archer%20%28Civ6%29](Pítati Archer) with part of [Tomyris%20%28Civ6%29](Tomyris') [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader ability). However, its use case generally differs from that of the Pítati Archer or the [Scythian%20%28Civ6%29](Scythians') ranged units in that it is best used for fending off early aggression and capturing [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) of enemies who settle within the Maya homeland, rather than as a tool for early aggression itself. To this end, the Hul'che also receives [Lady%20Six%20Sky%20%28Civ6%29](Lady Six Sky's) bonus of +5  Combat Strength within 6 [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles) of the Mayan , which can result in the Hul'che rivaling the [Crossbowman%20%28Civ6%29](Crossbowman) when firing on injured enemies close to the ! Generally speaking, Hul'che are best used in pairs or trios, with one Hul'che delivering the initial blow and the rest killing or severely wounding the target with their enhanced Ranged Strength.
Despite the in-game description stating that the Hul'che receives +5 Combat Strength when fighting wounded units, the bonus only applies in the form of Ranged Strength on offense without extra Combat Strength on defense when it gets attacked by a wounded unit.
