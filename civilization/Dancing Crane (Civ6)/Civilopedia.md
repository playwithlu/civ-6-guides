# Dancing Crane (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Chinese oral history says that the White Crane style of martial arts was created after Fang Qīniáng studied the movement of the animal which gives the technique its name. Today, it's primarily known as a hand-to-hand style, but it was once an armed technique.
Don't let the name of the animal fool you—Fang used her observations to develop a versatile style, one which reduced the distance between two opponents.
