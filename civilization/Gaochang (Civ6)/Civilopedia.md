# Gaochang (Civ6)/Civilopedia

During the Ninth Century, Gaochang would become home to the Turkic Uyghur. Their oasis in the desert would attract all, including practitioners of Buddhism, Manichaeism, and Nestorian Christianity. However, when the Uyghur settled in, they would convert to Buddhism and begin constructing temples during the Kingdom of Qocho.
