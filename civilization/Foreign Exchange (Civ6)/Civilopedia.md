# Foreign Exchange (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Since the creation of coinage, there has been an agreement that not everyone’s coins are valued equally. From this, the foreign exchange came into being, allowing traders to get locally-accepted currency in exchange for whatever coin they arrived with, usually allowing the exchanger to keep a percentage of the transaction. The English word “bank” derives from the Italian “banca,” which was the name of the counters where medieval money-men performed foreign exchange.
