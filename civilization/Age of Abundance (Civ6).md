# Age of Abundance (Civ6)

 is the first [Challenge%20of%20the%20month%20%28Civ6%29](challenge of the month) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)", running from November 14 to December 12, 2023.
Intro.
The Age of Abundance is upon us! From now until December 12, test your leadership skills in the first of our new series of in-game events by achieving a Culture Victory as the Greek politician and general, Pericles.
You start with two cities and 1000 gold, close to valuable resources, and on the exact same map as other Civilization VI players around the world. There are no barbarians to interfere with your plans, so the fate of Greece's cultural legacy is entirely in your hands. Good luck!
Strategy.
All [Victory%20%28Civ6%29](victory) conditions other than [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Culture Victory) are disabled in this challenge, so the your top priorities should be generating as much and as possible. It uses the [vanilla](vanilla) ruleset, so there are no [Government%20Plaza%20%28Civ6%29](Government Plazas), [Governor%20%28Civ6%29](Governors), or [Rock%20Band%20%28Civ6%29](Rock Bands) and [Naturalist%20%28Civ6%29](Naturalists) are much more expensive. The absence of [Era%20%28Civ6%29%23World%20Era](World Eras) means that [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-states) give new quests when you discover the first [Technology%20%28Civ6%29](technology) or [Civic%20%28Civ6%29](civic) of a new era, and may get skipped due to the rapid era progression. On the other hand, you don't have to worry about [Loyalty%20%28Civ6%29](Loyalty), [Climate%20%28Civ6%29](climate change), or [Disaster%20%28Civ6%29](disasters), and the absence of [Barbarian%20%28Civ6%29](Barbarians) makes exploration safe and easy as long as you aren't at war with other [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations).
As soon as the game begins, train a [Scout%20%28Civ6%29](Scout) to explore your starting island and find choice places for new [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities), then start searching for [Tribal%20Village%20%28Civ6%29](Tribal Villages) and [Resource%20%28Civ6%29](resource)-rich tracts of land on other [Continent%20%28Civ6%29](continents). Some parts of your island are ideal for establishing [National%20Park%20%28Civ6%29](National Parks), and there's also a lot of [Coastal%20%28Civ6%29](coastal) flatland on which you can build [Seaside%20Resort%20%28Civ6%29](Seaside Resorts). Always settle adjacent to [Hills%20%28Civ6%29](Hills) so you can build [Acropolis%20%28Civ6%29](Acropolises) next to your [City%20Center%20%28Civ6%29](City Centers) for maximum bonuses. If you want to make use of [Religion%20%28Civ6%29](religion), build a [Holy%20Site%20%28Civ6%29](Holy Site) in one of your cities and then run [Holy%20Site%20Prayers%20%28Civ6%29](Holy Site Prayers) to earn large numbers of points - you won't be able to found one once you progress to the [Industrial%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Industrial Era), so you have to work quickly.
The [AI](AI) [Leaders%20%28Civ6%29](leaders) in this challenge don't really seem to care about building [Wonder%20%28Civ6%29](wonders), so keep that in mind when deciding which ones to build and in what city. The northern part of your island has a lot of [Rainforest%20%28Civ6%29](Rainforests) in which you can build [Chichen%20Itza%20%28Civ6%29](Chichen Itza) for extra and , and [Cristo%20Redentor%20%28Civ6%29](Cristo Redentor) and the [Eiffel%20Tower%20%28Civ6%29](Eiffel Tower) are must-haves to maximize the of your Seaside Resorts and National Parks.
Every city should have either a [Commercial%20Hub%20%28Civ6%29](Commercial Hub) or a [Harbor%20%28Civ6%29](Harbor) to ensure that you can maintain as many s as possible. This will provide you not only with , but also with bonuses to generation against your opponents (as well as other yields if you slot the right [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](policy cards)). You should also make it a priority to patronize [Melitta%20Bentz%20%28Civ6%29](Melitta Bentz) in the [Modern%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Modern Era) and [Sarah%20Breedlove%20%28Civ6%29](Sarah Breedlove) in the [Atomic%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Atomic Era) - these two [Great%20Merchant%20%28Civ6%29](Great Merchants) will further augment your bonuses from s.
[Diplomacy%20%28Civ6%29](Diplomacy) and [Espionage%20%28Civ6%29](espionage) should be key components of your strategy, as well. Make sure you keep at least one running to and have [Diplomacy%20%28Civ6%29%23Open%20Borders](Open Borders) with each of your opponents - if you're worried about their pressure, paying them a small sum of will usually be enough to get them to open their [Borders%20%28Civ6%29](borders) to you. If they've procured [Great%20Work%20%28Civ6%29](Great Works) that you need to fill the [Building%20%28Civ6%29](buildings) in your Acropolises, send [Spy%20%28Civ6%29](Spies) to steal them and improve your and output at your opponents' expense.
Pericles' [List%20of%20leader%20abilities%20in%20Civ6](leader ability) gives you a good incentive to spread out your s and become the [Suzerain%20%28Civ6%29](Suzerain) of as many city-states as possible, but you should prioritize cultural city-states. [Kumasi%20%28Civ6%29](Kumasi) and [Nan%20Madol%20%28Civ6%29](Nan Madol) are especially valuable for this challenge - the former will give you additional for sending s to city-states, and the latter will increase the output of s built next to [Coast%20%28Civ6%29](Coast) and [Lake%20%28Civ6%29](Lake) [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles).
The best policy cards to use will depend on where your is coming from, but [Heritage%20Tourism%20%28Civ6%29](Heritage Tourism) and [Satellite%20Broadcasts%20%28Civ6%29](Satellite Broadcasts) are good choices if you have many Artifacts and Great Works. Other fine choices include [Raj%20%28Civ6%29](Raj), [International%20Space%20Agency%20%28Civ6%29](International Space Agency), [Collective%20Activism%20%28Civ6%29](Collective Activism), and anything that increases your s' yields, your generation, or the utility of your s.
All told, you shouldn't have much trouble completing this challenge as long as you focus on improving your and output, keep your empire's economy strong, and don't get caught up in too many wars.
