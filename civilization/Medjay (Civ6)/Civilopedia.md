# Medjay (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Once referring to the people from the Nubian land of Medja, by the 16th Century BCE the name “medjay” was synonymous with an elite force employing both Nubians and Egyptians. Charged with protecting monuments, palaces, and tombs, the mostly autonomous medjay reported to regional captains who oversaw their allocation.
