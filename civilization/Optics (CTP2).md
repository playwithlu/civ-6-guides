Optical instruments, such as telescopes, expanded the frontiers of scientific research. proved that the solar system was, in fact, heliocentric, overturning centuries of widely held beliefs about the nature of the universe.

Although the ancient Arabs and Greeks possessed some knowledge of the properties of light, the science of optics was not established until the 17th century. In the first decade of the 17th century, Galileo Galilei, the Italian astronomer and physicist, was the first to construct telescopes for astronomical observation. By arranging lenses of various sizes and intensities in a tube, Galileo created an instrument that could display distant objects as if they were close by. His inventions won him acclaim and paved the way to a greater understanding of celestial bodies. Many later scientists, including Pierre de Fermat, Christiaan Huygens and Isaac Newton continued work in the field of optics, eventually developing complex theories on the nature of light.
