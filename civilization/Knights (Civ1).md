# Knights (Civ1)

Knights are a powerful mounted unit. The successor to the [Chariot%20%28Civ1%29](Chariot) with slightly more defensive power at no additional cost.
Civilopedia entry.
Knights of the Middle Ages were the consummate heavy cavalry. Mounted on huge horses bred for power rather than speed, encased in armor, braced in stirrups, and charging at a thunderous gallop, they were a terrifying prospect to the knaves and ruffians on foot. They were the medieval equivalent of the M1 Main Battle Tank. Although innovative tactics and defensive formations sometimes made Knights ineffective, they dominated the battlefield until the development of firearms. They remained the primary offensive weapon of war until the day arrived when they could be shot out of the saddle from a distance.
