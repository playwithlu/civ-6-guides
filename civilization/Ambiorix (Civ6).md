# Ambiorix (Civ6)

Ambiorix (? â€“ 53 BC) was a king of the Gallic tribe in northeastern Gaul, nowadays [Belgian](Belgium), who became infamous during the for leading against the [Roman](Roman) occupation forces commanded by [Julius%20Caesar%20%28Civ6%29](Julius Caesar), wiping out fifteen Roman before finally being defeated. He leads the [Gallic%20%28Civ6%29](Gauls) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Ambiorix builds a swarm of [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](units) to overwhelm his foes via strategic construction of [Mine%20%28Civ6%29](mines) and his unique [Oppidum%20%28Civ6%29](Oppidum) [District%20%28Civ6%29](district).
In-Game.
Ambiorix's unique [Agenda%20%28Civ6%29](agenda) is Scourge of Rome. He likes leaders with many military units and dislikes those with few military units.
His leader ability is King of the Eburones. He gains {{Culture6}} equal to the 20% of the {{Production6}} cost of each non-civilian unit he trains, and his [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Melee](melee), [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Ranged](ranged), and [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Anti-cavalry](anti-cavalry units) (as well as [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Recon](recon units)) receive +2 {{Strength6}} Combat Strength for each adjacent military unit.
Detailed Approach.
The Gauls under Ambiorix have two main objectives: building mines and using this production to train an onslaught of units. Gaul's unique civilization trait gives mines [Adjacency%20bonus%20%28Civ6%29](adjacency bonuses) as well as {{Culture6}} and {{Tourism6}}, meaning that building a lot of them is a must. In war, Ambiorix's unique trait gives strength to units adjacent to each other, meaning that the more units, the stronger the army. To make Gaulish armies more effective, the [Gaesatae%20%28Civ6%29](Gaesatae) unit gains bonuses when attacking [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) or units stronger than it, and the unique district, the Oppidum, unlocks early and also carries with it a high adjacency bonus. Gaul is very strong for those seeking a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Domination](Domination Victory), but also can be made to be an effective {{Culture6}}-focused civilization as well.
