Strategy.
The Minutemen have some exceptional abilities, which allow them to fight and outmaneuver the enemy in rough [Terrain%20%28Civ5%29](terrain). They're at their best when they can use their natural advantages in [Forest%20%28Civ5%29](forests), [Hill%20%28Civ5%29](hills), and other such terrain. Additionally, Minutemen have a [Promotions%20%28Civ5%29](promotion) to earn points toward s with kills! The number of points earned are equal to either the Combat Strength or the Ranged Combat Strength of the unit (whichever is greater), so it never gets out-of-date.
As their bonuses are promotions, any Minuteman that is upgraded to a [Rifleman%20%28Civ5%29](Rifleman) and further down the chain will retain them.
