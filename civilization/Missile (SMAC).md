# Missile (SMAC)

Game info.
Missiles can be used to mount powerful {{LinkSMAC|Conventional Payload}}s, {{LinkSMAC|Fungal Payload}}s, {{LinkSMAC|Tectonic Payload}}s or spectacular quasi-nuclear {{LinkSMAC|Planet Buster}}s. Missiles pack a powerful punch, but are of course eliminated when they attack.
