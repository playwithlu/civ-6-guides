# Janissary (Civ5)

Game Info.
[Unique%20unit%20%28Civ5%29](Unique) front-line unit of the [Ottoman%20%28Civ5%29](Ottoman) [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilization). Replaces the [Musketman%20%28Civ5%29](Musketman).
Strategy.
The Janissary is a very dangerous unit, designed to always be on the offensive. Similarly to the [Jaguar%20%28Civ5%29](Jaguar), a much earlier unit of the [Aztec%20%28Civ5%29](Aztecs), it will heal when it destroys a unit, but it also receives a combat bonus when attacking. Its heal ability also heals 50 [HP](HP) upon killing a unit instead of the 25 HP for the [Jaguar%20%28Civ5%29](Jaguar) - albeit with the caveat that the Janissary's ability does not work against [Barbarian%20%28Civ5%29](Barbarians).
Time your major offensives around the time the Janissary becomes available for a major advantage over your enemies and push until you've reached all objectives of your campaign! The Janissary's bonuses are [Promotions%20%28Civ5%29](promotions), and will be retained by any Janissary upgraded to a [Rifleman%20%28Civ5%29](Rifleman).
