Because the National Visitor Center becomes available quite late in the game, you should be ready to build it right away (so as not to lag behind other players pursuing their [Victory%20%28Civ5%29](victory) conditions of choice). So, take care to build Hotels in all your cities even before you research [Telecommunications%20%28Civ5%29](Telecommunications) - this shouldn't be a problem, since if you're striving for a cultural victory, you should be building Hotels anyway, and they don't cost any maintenance.
