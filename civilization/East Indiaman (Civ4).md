# East Indiaman (Civ4)

The East Indiaman is the [Unique%20unit%20%28Civ4%29](unique unit) of the [Dutch%20%28Civ4%29](Dutch) [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ4](civilization).
Strategy.
Compared with the [Galleon%20%28Civ4%29](Galleon), the East Indiaman has 2 more strength and one more cargo space. In addition, the East Indiaman can explore in other civilizations' territories without causing a declaration of war, making it even more useful in exploring the world.
Using East Indiamen.
Many players will leave researching [Astronomy%20%28Civ4%29](Astronomy) until later (except in heavily water-based [Map%20%28Civ4%29](maps)), as it obsoletes a few things. As a result, East Indiamen are pretty safe alone for quite a while. Giving them [Navigation%20%28Civ4%29](Navigation) [Promotion%20%28Civ4%29](promotions) will make them more effective at crossing the seas quickly.
As East Indiamen match [Privateer%20%28Civ4%29](Privateers) in strength, they're mostly safe from them.
Against East Indiamen.
Getting a higher-strength unit (e.g. Ship of the Line, Frigate) is recommended for dealing with East Indiamen. Remember that they can explore your territory even without open borders, so block any sea bottlenecks you don't want them going through.
