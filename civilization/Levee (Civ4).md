# Levee (Civ4)

The Levee is replaced by the following [Unique%20building%20%28Civ4%29](unique building):
Strategy.
Build the Levee to receive a bonus production from river tiles.
When placing a city, it may be unclear whether a tile is adjacent to a river. For example, tiles which touch the source of a river, but which are "behind" the source with respect to its direction of flow, are "not" riverside. Hovering over a tile and checking the tooltip for Fresh Water usually helps, but may be ambiguous if the tile is also adjacent to a freshwater lake. Another potential indication is the tile's yield: if the tile has an extra beyond that provided by any [Resource%20%28Civ4%29](resources) or [Improvement%20%28Civ4%29](improvements), then the tile will surely be riverside. However, the +1 may be obscured by a [Terrain%20%28Civ4%29%23Terrain%20features](Forest) or Jungle.
