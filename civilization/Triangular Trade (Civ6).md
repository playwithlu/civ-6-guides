# Triangular Trade (Civ6)

Triangular Trade is an Economic [Policy%20Cards%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
Triangular Trade is a good go-to policy for those who have plenty of s, be they domestic or international, for this applies to both.
When slotted, this policy gives +4 and +1 to all s, which can make the money really start to roll in. This is a great policy for [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) dependent on trade and those short on money. The +1 can help out religious civs too, either when buying military [Units%20%28Civ6%29](units) (with [Theocracy%20%28Civ6%29](Theocracy) or the [Grand%20Master%27s%20Chapel%20%28Civ6%29](Grand Master's Chapel)) or [Missionary%20%28Civ6%29](Missionaries) and [Apostle%20%28Civ6%29](Apostles) to spread their [Religion%20%28Civ6%29](religion).
