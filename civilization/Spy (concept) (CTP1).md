Spies have been critical to Civilizations since the origins of time. In 500 BC General Sun Tzu indirectly advocated the use of spies when he wrote that to remain in ignorance and send troops against an unknown enemy reached the height of inhumanity. George Washington won the first military victory of the United States with the help of John Honeymoon, who spied against the British. Margareta Gertruda Zelle, also known as Mata Hari, served as a spy for many nations prior to and during WWI. The technological advances of the late 20th and early 21st centuries allowed satellites, remote recording devices, decryption programs, and other electronic surveillance tools to produce a great deal of data. However, intelligence gathering still required field operatives. Thus the lifestyle of a spy remained full of treachery, deceit, and intrigue.
