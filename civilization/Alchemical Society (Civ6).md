# Alchemical Society (Civ6)

The Alchemical Society is a [Building%20%28Civ6%29](building) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is exclusive to the [Hermetic%20Order%20%28Civ6%29](Hermetic Order) secret society in the [Secret%20Societies%20%28Civ6%29](Secret Societies) [Game%20mode%20%28Civ6%29](game mode), introduced in the [Ethiopia%20Pack%20%28Civ6%29](Ethiopia Pack). It is built in the [Campus%20%28Civ6%29](Campus) [District%20%28Civ6%29](district) and replaces the [University%20%28Civ6%29](University).
Strategy.
The Alchemical Society is a fine replacement for the standard University. The +2 bonus is somewhat helpful, but the main selling point of this building is that it provides a point and a point in addition to the University's point. This helps [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) such as [Kongolese%20%28Civ6%29](Kongo), [Swedish%20%28Civ6%29](Sweden), [Brazilian%20%28Civ6%29](Brazil), and [Scottish%20%28Civ6%29](Scotland), whose goal is to recruit as many as possible. It also plays decently well into the Hermetic Order's [Magus%20%28Civ6%29](Magus), unlocked in the [Industrial%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Industrial Era), which grants extra yields to their signature s. The extra from the [Adjacency%20bonus%20%28Civ6%29](adjacency bonus) of the district is underwhelming, since even a +4 bonus is only enough to pay off the maintenance cost of the district, the [Library%20%28Civ6%29](Library), and this building. However, combining this with the [Natural%20Philosophy%20%28Civ6%29](Natural Philosophy) [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](policy card) can give you a respectable profit.
The ability to construct the Alchemical Society will supersede all other University replacements, so those playing as [Arabian%20%28Civ6%29](Arabia) and [Portuguese%20%28Civ6%29](Portugal) should decide if the benefits of joining this society outweighs losing the bonuses from the [Madrasa%20%28Civ6%29](Madrasa) and [Navigation%20School%20%28Civ6%29](Navigation School) respectively. It is usually better to pick the [Voidsingers%20%28Civ6%29](Voidsingers) with Arabia and the [Owls%20of%20Minerva%20%28Civ6%29](Owls of Minerva) with Portugal, due to the former relying on [Religion%20%28Civ6%29](religion) and the latter relying on s.
