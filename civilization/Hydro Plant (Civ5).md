# Hydro Plant (Civ5)

Game Info.
Advanced electricity building. City must be built next to a [Rivers%20%28Civ5%29](river).
Strategy.
The Hydro Plant increases the output of every tile without a mountain the city works which is also adjacent to the river. Thus cities which control more river tiles can make better use of a Hydro Plant than cities with 2-3 eligible river tiles. Consider this when selecting where to build a Hydro Plant, because the resource it consumes becomes very important later in the game.
