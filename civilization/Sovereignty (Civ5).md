# Sovereignty (Civ5)

Sovereignty is a [Social%20policies%20%28Civ5%29](social policy) in "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)". It is part of the [Rationalism%20%28Civ5%29](Rationalism) tree and requires . In "[Brave%20New%20World](Brave New World)" it requires [Secularism%20%28Civ5%29](Secularism).
The next step in establishing a contemporary, rational society, after the development of Secularism, is to recognize that the power a sovereign possesses comes from the people he governs, rather than from some nebulous ideal, order, or deity. This concept tends to improve the country's economy first, by allowing scientific buildings to contribute to economical development as well. Second, it is the necessary step to trigger the explosive development of modern science known as the "scientific revolution."
Strategy.
This mid-level Policy goes a bit off-topic, and develops your production based on scientific buildings you have. It's a nice way to upgrade all these boring schools and universities, and it combines well with the secondary effect of [Free%20Thought%20%28Civ5%29](Free Thought), which focuses on a purely economic [Improvement%20%28Civ5%29](improvement). Note, however, that this Policy doesn't increase in any way (unless you count the added incentive to construct science buildings). As far as scientific progression goes, it is just a stepping stone towards the level 3 Policy of the tree.
