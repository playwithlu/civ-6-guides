# Melody (Civ6)/Civilopedia

The music pipes in from somewhere - everywhere, it seems. From the corners of empty rooms, from the wind over the night sea, even from the spaces underneath your fingernails. At least it seems like music. It is a shrill piping and a burst of chanting in something that almost sounds like a language. Then, it is gone.
