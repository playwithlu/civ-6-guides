# Madrasah (Civ5)

Game Info.
Unique scientific building of the Ayyubid civilization in the [Into%20the%20Renaissance%20%28Civ5%29](Into the Renaissance) [List%20of%20scenarios%20in%20Civ5](scenario) of "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)". Replaces the [University%20%28Civ5%29](University). Requires [Library%20%28Civ5%29](Library).
Strategy.
The Madrasah is a Medieval-era building. It increases the {{Science5}} output of the city, and it's even more effective if the city is near to [Jungle%20%28Civ5%29](jungle) tiles. The city must already have a [Library%20%28Civ5%29](Library) to construct a Madrasah. It also provides {{Faith5}}, unlike the [University%20%28Civ5%29](University) which it replaces.
