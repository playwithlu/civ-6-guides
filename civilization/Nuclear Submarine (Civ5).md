# Nuclear Submarine (Civ5)

Game Info.
Advanced naval ranged unit of the [Information%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Information Era). Upgrades from the [Submarine%20%28Civ5%29](Submarine).
Strategy.
The Nuclear Submarine is tougher and stronger than the [Modern%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Modern-era) model, with engines and battle systems updated for the Information Era. It too is invisible to most units and can see other submarines. Most importantly, Nuclear Submarines can carry [Guided%20Missile%20%28Civ5%29](Guided Missiles) and [Nuclear%20Missile%20%28Civ5%29](Nuclear Missiles), making them one of the most dangerous weapons in the game. This ensures their use in a naval invasion, destroying defending units and [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities) alike, after which they can be used as long range defenders, ensuring troops may be transported to the battlefield without being harassed by naval warships.
Like their precursors, Nuclear Submarines are vulnerable to enemy [Destroyer%20%28Civ5%29](Destroyers), [Missile%20Cruiser%20%28Civ5%29](Missile Cruisers), and other subs, so send units of your own out ahead to make sure the coast is clear.
