Shortly after the invention of the forcefield, many governments initiated discussions on implementing a nation-wide forcefield system to protect all cities, regardless of size. Large metropolises had little trouble finding the financing and construction resources to build their own forcefields, leaving the mayors of smaller cities to appeal to their national leaders for support. The Viking Empire inaugurated the first "National Shield" program on March 1, 2067. By adding satellite maintenance and monitoring systems, the vast empire was able to protect each city from attack.
