# Beliefs (Civ6)

Beliefs are the practical expressions of the divine powers. Similarly to [Pantheon%20%28Civ6%29](Pantheons), they take the form of gameplay bonuses and can increase yields of particular gameplay elements ([Building%20%28Civ6%29](buildings), [District%20%28Civ6%29](districts), etc.), allow access to new ones, or modify game mechanics. However, unlike Pantheons, they work only in the [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) which currently follow their particular [Religion%20%28Civ6%29](Religion), even inside the empire of the Religion's founder.
Mechanics.
There are four main types of belief in the game: Follower Belief, Worship Belief, Founder Belief, and Enhancer Belief. Every Religion can only have a maximum of four beliefs, one of each type.
Each Religion is attributed with beliefs, which are in fact gameplay bonuses.
When you found your Religion, it starts with two beliefs. Of these two, the first one to choose is a mandatory Follower Belief, and the other may be a Founder Belief, a Worship Belief or an Enhancer Belief. Later, you may add two additional beliefs to your Religion using an [Apostle%20%28Civ6%29](Apostle's) Evangelize Belief action. This will destroy the Apostle, so you'll need to sacrifice two Apostles to have the maximum number of beliefs allowed. You may add these beliefs whenever you wish - that is, there is no time limit to this possibility, and the limited number of Religions that can be created ensures that you will always have some beliefs to choose from.
All beliefs are unique, chosen from a common pool, and can be assigned to only one Religion. That means that later-founded Religions cannot choose beliefs which have already been assigned to earlier Religions. Thus, the more Religions are founded, the fewer beliefs there will be to choose from and if you are late at founding your Religion, your choice will be more limited.
List of beliefs.
Follower.
These benefit any city that follows the religion, regardless of who its Founder was. Players who have not Founded a Religion will mainly benefit from this type of Beliefs.
Worship.
These allow any city that follows the religion to build (or use {{Faith6}} to purchase) Tier 3 worship buildings in its [Holy%20Site%20%28Civ6%29](Holy Site) districts. Note that each Holy Site may contain only one worship building, which stays there permanently. If the dominant religion in the city changes later, and the new one has a different Worship Belief, you will not be able to replace the worship building that already exists there.
Founder.
These benefit only the civilization that founded the religion (or the [Kongolese%20%28Civ6%29](Kongolese) when led by [Mvemba%20a%20Nzinga%20%28Civ6%29](Mvemba a Nzinga)). Their starting benefits may be slightly weaker than other belief types, but they will work for each converted city or for each follower, potentially increasing the benefits far beyond other belief types.
Enhancer.
These beliefs aid the spread and defense of the religion. Only the founder of the Religion will benefit from these (or the [Kongolese%20%28Civ6%29](Kongolese) when led by [Mvemba%20a%20Nzinga%20%28Civ6%29](Mvemba a Nzinga)).
Strategy.
Good religious beliefs can be the deciding factor in close games. As such, let's review each belief and how useful it is.
