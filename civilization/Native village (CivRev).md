# Native village (CivRev)

Native villages are like [Barbarian%20%28CivRev%29](Barbarian) villages in many ways, but there are some key differences. The biggest is that they are peaceful so you can just walk over them. When this happens, the most likely thing the village will award you is 25 [Gold%20%28currency%29%20%28CivRev%29](Gold). They may also give you a [Caravan%20%28CivRev%29](Caravan) or [Spy%20%28CivRev%29](Spy), but never [Horsemen%20%28CivRev%29](Horsemen) or [Galley%20%28CivRev%29](Galleys), being peaceful. 
Like Barbarians, native villages may show you other Barbarian villages or [Artifacts%20%28CivRev%29](artifacts). Artifacts are shown when they are near the village in question; the revealing of Barbarian villages follows a similar behavior, but nearby artifacts are prioritized. Native villages are also similar to Barbarian villages because their visual appearance depends on the latitude at which they spawn, and they generate a random [List%20of%20resources%20in%20CivRev](resource) on their [Tile%20%28CivRev%29](tile) once a player activates them.
