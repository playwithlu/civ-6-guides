# Cristo Redentor (Civ4)/Civilopedia

Cristo Redentor, "Christ the Redeemer" in English, is a 125-foot tall statue of Jesus Christ situated on Corcovado Mountain, watching over the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro. First proposed in 1921 during celebrations of the centennial of Brazilian independence, Cristo Redentor slowly began to take shape through the eyes of potential designers. By 1931, the statue had been completed, making it the largest art deco monument in the world. Since that time, the statue, seated 2330 above sea level, has become an awesome symbol of Rio de Janeiro and of Brazil.
