# Naval Tactics (Civ3)/Napoleonic Europe/Civilopedia

The Napoleonic period was a time when rival European fleets, typically consisting of
large numbers of wooden-hulled frigates and ships of the line, vied for naval supremacy.
As these deadly contests at sea took place, naval tactics continued to evolve. One of the
most decisive maneuvers that a fleet tried to execute was to "Cross the T", done when
one long "battle line" of ships managed to attain a perpendicular aspect to the enemy
fleet, thereby bringing the firepower of all their ships to bear in raking volleys up
and down the line of the ill-positioned foe.
By the end of the Napoleonic period the British navy emerged strong and triumphant --
the supreme naval power of the world, due in no small part to the genius of Admiral Horatio
Nelson, whose name still today is synonymous with the British Navy.
