A rare and expensive delicacy, truffles are the fruit of a family of mushrooms that grow underground.

One of the more unusual aspects are the means by which they are acquired, that is via "truffle hog."

With an uncanny sense of smell, truffle hogs are said to have been in use since the Roman Era.
