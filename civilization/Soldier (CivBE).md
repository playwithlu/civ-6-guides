# Soldier (CivBE)

Game info.
Soldiers and their upgrades are the basic but formidable human infantry units of Beyond Earth. Armed with close range rifles and multi-purpose tactical suits, they are cheap and durable, capable to form the first line of defense (or offense) of any army. Being melee fighters they boast respectable and are able to capture cities. As a sponsor's Affinity increases they may alter their purpose as fighters and can become mobile attackers, defensive sentinels or hive-minded masses.
Unit Upgrades.
Tier 1 &amp; Tier 2 (Non Affinity).
Early on, Soldiers do not take on a distinctive appearance. They look similar to that of Old Earth military and still carry large visible oxygen tanks. When upgraded to Marines, they can choose to be on the offensive or to gain regenerative capabilities.
Tier 3 (Primary Affinity).
At Tier 3, players may diverge into three different types of Soldier based on their primary Affinity. These units have distinct perks that change the way they function, such as working alone (Brawlers), as defensive towers (Sentinels), or as working in groups (Disciples).
Tier 4 (Final &amp; Hybrid Affinities).
In Tier 4, players may continue following a single Affinity or could invest in hybrid units that are typically more versatile.
Primary affinity units (Tier 4).
Primary affinity units have access to more powerful perks than Hybrid unit, such as all terrain costing 1 movement (Brawlers), +1 Movement which can increase mobility greatly (Sentinels), or working even better in groups (Disciples). However, their Affinity requirement is substantially higher than that of Hybrid units, so they appear later on in the game.
Hybrid affinity units (Tier 4).
Hybrid units blend elements from the primary Affinities together. As they do not excel primarily in one Affinity, their perk choices are not as spectacular as the primary Affinity units', gaining general bonuses as choices. However, their Affinity requirement is much less than their primary counterparts, so they can be acquired quicker - this means that against a primary Affinity sponsor, your units will be more developed and far stronger in the early to middle game.
Game Fiction.
The Soldiers were the first humans to descend on any alien planet. These brave men and women were tasked with the initial reconnaissance missions on each new world, with establishing and protecting the meteorological and scientific stations which gathered the vital information that told us whether this world was suitable for our kind or not. They had to face almost insurmountable odds, supplied with limited equipment and almost without external support. They had to weather alien storms, trudge strange alien landscapes, enter alien nests to retrieve vital information or pieces of stolen equipment...
It was only natural that those that survived were converted into the first line of defense for our budding colonies. Using all the experience they gathered during their harsh missions, the Soldiers form the backbone of colonial military and serve as the stepping stone towards much better equipped and advanced troops.
