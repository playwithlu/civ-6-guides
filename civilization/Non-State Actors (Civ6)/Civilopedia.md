# Non-State Actors (Civ6)/Civilopedia

The term “plausible deniability” is used to describe espionage actions which may be disavowed by the diplomats and public figures within the state that undertook them. Of these methods, non-state actors are the most common. In this system, the spies of a state provide support to individuals or groups seeking to undermine enemies of the state. The state may (technically) claim not to have undertaken the effort—they just paid someone else to do it. This may include cases where the intelligence agency does not possess the expertise in a new system of subversion but has access to a like-minded group that does. It becomes more difficult for the aggrieved party to bring a united front against the state in this case.
