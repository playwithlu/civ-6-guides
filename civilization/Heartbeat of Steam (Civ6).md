Available from the Industrial Era, Heartbeat of Steam is one of the best overall Golden Age policy cards, as it gives you a bonus for every [Campus%20%28Civ6%29](Campus) based on its [Adjacency%20bonus%20%28Civ6%29](adjacency bonus). It works especially well with [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) who can easily earn high adjacency bonus for their Campuses: [Korean%20%28Civ6%29](Korea), the [Mayan%20%28Civ6%29](Maya), and [Australian%20%28Civ6%29](Australia). If there is a [Wonder%20%28Civ6%29](wonder) crucial to your strategy, it may be worth running this card even if the adjacency bonuses of your Campuses are less than optimal; otherwise, you may be better off dedicating your precious Wildcard slot to something else.
