Civilopedia entry.
As an empire developed, its ruler usually established a headquarters where he conducted the day-to-day managing of an empire. This building often also served as the ruler's home. In civilizations with great wealth, these structures often expanded into immense, sprawling complexes. These richly adorned, imposing palaces were a source of civic pride, and helped to reinforce the ruler's aura of power and majesty.
