# Bacchanalia (Civ3)/Civilopedia

The Roman god Bacchus, known earlier to the Greeks as Dionysus, was the god of wine and
plants, and was also associated with procreation and lust (since Bacchus’ association
with plants represented a general theme of vigor and growth). His worshippers, at
first disproportionately women but later encompassing men as well, engaged in long,
exhausting ritual celebrations at private lodges -- not unlike modern-day fraternity
houses! Bacchanalia referred to a specific series of festivals and celebrations in
the
god’s honor. Usually these celebrations included plays and songs in addition to plenty of
wine. However, late in the Roman Republic they were deemed immoral and outlawed, although
they continued in secret.
Most Greek and Roman gods were, according to myth, accompanied and assisted by nature
spirits or other lesser mythical creatures. Bacchus was typically depicted with satyrs,
centaurs, and other beast/man combinations. His was one of the most primal of the early
Greek cults, appealing to man’s baser instincts and connection with nature.
