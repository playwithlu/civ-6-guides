# Shipbuilding (Civ6)

Shipbuilding is a [Classical%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Classical Era) [Technologies%20%28Civ6%29](technology) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It can be hurried by having two [Galley%20%28Civ6%29](Galleys).
In "", it leads to [Buttress%20%28Civ6%29](Buttress). 
Strategy.
The next logical step for conquering the seas is to develop proper vessels to sail them. Thus is the art of Shipbuilding born, and the true conquest of the blue expanses begins.
The masters of shipbuilding are able to improve the efficiency of current ship designs, which are manifested by the new [Quadrireme%20%28Civ6%29](Quadrireme) and the slew of transport ships which allow for all sorts of land-based [Units%20%28Civ6%29](units) to travel at sea and bring seafaring to a whole new level.
Shipbuilding is very easy to research (requiring only [Sailing%20%28Civ6%29](Sailing)), but whether or not it will be useful to you depends on how you want to use the sea, if you're using it at all! Again, a landlocked civ may forego this tech for a very long time. But even a seafaring civ may find little use for Shipbuilding if they don't find new lands where they can send their land units.
On the other hand, Shipbuilding unlocks the first ranged ship in the game, and if you have opportunities to wage war from the seas, it could give you a huge advantage!
