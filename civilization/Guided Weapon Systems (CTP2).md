Gameplay.
The advent of Guided Weapons Systems enables the creation of {{LinkCTP2|Cruise Missile}}s, which can be targeted from great distances. Although they lack a nuclear warhead, these intercontinental missiles still manage to pack a punch.
Great Library entry.
Guided weapon systems integrated tactical weapons with electronics for aiming, targeting and fire control. They ranged from systems for antitank and antiaircraft defense, battlefield support and both aerial and naval combat. In post-World War II conflicts, navies and air forces began outfitting ships and planes with various guided missiles and bombs, and their use and development continued for decades.
