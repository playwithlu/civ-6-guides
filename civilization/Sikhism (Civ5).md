Game Info.
Unlike the [Religion%20%28Civ4%29](religions) in "[Civilization%20IV](Civilization IV)", this religion has no technological requirements to be unlocked and neither unique buildings nor a unique missionary unit. Like all other religions, Sikhism can be founded directly after using a [Great%20Prophet%20%28Civ5%29](Great Prophet's) Found Religion ability and only one [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilization) can be the founder of this religion.
Sikhism is not the preferred religion of any civilization in "Gods &amp; Kings" or "Brave New World".
