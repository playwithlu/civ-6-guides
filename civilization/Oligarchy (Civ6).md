# Oligarchy (Civ6)

Oligarchy is a form of Tier 1 [Government%20%28Civ6%29](government) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is unlocked by the [Political%20Philosophy%20%28Civ6%29](Political Philosophy) [Civic%20%28Civ6%29](civic).
In ', this government's legacy bonus is conferred by Oligarchic Legacy, a Wildcard [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](policy) unlocked by changing governments after adopting Oligarchy and constructing a Tier 1 government [Building%20%28Civ6%29](building) ([Ancestral%20Hall%20%28Civ6%29](Ancestral Hall), [Audience%20Chamber%20%28Civ6%29](Audience Chamber), or [Warlord%27s%20Throne%20%28Civ6%29](Warlord's Throne)).
Strategy.
Card-wise, Oligarchy is the strongest military government of the [Classical%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Classical Era), thereby attracting the interest of [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) such as [Sumerian%20%28Civ6%29](Sumeria) and [Roman%20%28Civ6%29](Rome), and also offers a major boost to early-game {{Strength6}} Combat Strength. For civilizations such as [Greek%20%28Civ6%29](Greece) under [Gorgo%20%28Civ6%29](Gorgo), using it is almost a given. Other civilizations whose [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader abilities) deal with {{Strength6}} Combat Strength, such as [Tomyris%20%28Civ6%29](Tomyris') [Scythian%20%28Civ6%29](Scythia), can also make great use of Oligarchy's strength bonus if played correctly. Even [American%20%28Civ6%29](America), historically known as a mid-to-late game civilization, can use this government type to launch devastating early wars with a collective total of +9 {{Strength6}} Combat Strength.
Note that Oligarchy's {{Strength6}} Combat Strength bonus applies only to specific [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class](unit classes), so in the early game, it affects only [Warrior%20%28Civ6%29](Warriors) and [Swordsman%20%28Civ6%29](Swordsmen) (as well as [Spearman%20%28Civ6%29](Spearmen) and [Galley%20%28Civ6%29](Galleys) in the expansions). Even though they aren't conventional [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Melee](melee units), [Warrior%20Monk%20%28Civ6%29](Warrior Monks), [Nihang%20%28Civ6%29](Nihang), and [Vampire%20%28Civ6%29](Vampires) also receive the bonus from this government.
