# Trajan (Civ6)

Marcus Ulpius Trajanus (18 September 53 â€“ 8 August 117), more commonly known as Trajan, was from 98 AD until his death. He is best remembered for achieving one of the in Roman history, as well as for his philanthropic rule, enacting extensive and that led to him being recognized as one of the "". He leads the [Roman%20%28Civ6%29](Romans) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Rome is the one civ you can trust to continue to push to be the largest empire in the game. Trajan takes [Julius%20Caesar%20%28Civ6%29](Julius Caesar's) words to heart: "Veni, vidi, vici" (I came, I saw, I conquered).
Intro.
 Cast your net wide, oh Trajan, emperor of mighty Rome. Your legions stand at the ready to march out and establish the largest empire the world has ever seen. If you can truly get all roads to lead to Rome, yours will be an empire of great riches and luxuries. Surely then our citizens will proclaim you as their best ruler, the Optimus Princeps.
In-Game.
Trajan's unique [Agenda%20%28Civ6%29](agenda) is Optimus Princeps. He tries to incorporate as much territory as possible into his empire, and he dislikes civilizations that control little territory.
His [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader ability) is Trajan's Column. All of his [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) get an additional [City%20Center%20%28Civ6%29](City Center) [Buildings%20%28Civ6%29](building) (which will be a [Monument%20%28Civ6%29](Monument) if the game is started in the [Ancient%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Ancient Era)).
Detailed Approach.
Rome wants to get cities down quickly and then speed along the path to [Engineering%20%28Civ6%29](Engineering). With Engineering in place, [Bath%20%28Civ6%29](Baths) can be added to their cities and they will grow rapidly (and expand rapidly with Trajan's free Monuments). Their "All Roads Lead to Rome" ability gives them a steady income from their network of cities. (s from the interior cities of their empires to foreign lands should work well; not all their s need to be internal.) Though all this expansion will lead to conflict, it will likely be just the time that the [Legion%20%28Civ6%29](Legion) comes online. The Legion's ability to build [Fort%20%28Civ6%29](Forts) comes in two [Era%20%28Civ6%29](eras) earlier for Rome than for other civilizations. Using these effectively is the key in being able to hold onto his expansive and powerful empire.
