Gameplay.
Although not officially classified as expansionistic, Stalin grows his nation extremely quickly, and his early militaristic aggression makes him a tremendous threat throughout the game.
If he has access to [List%20of%20resources%20in%20Civ1](resources) and land, you will find he produces vast waves of military [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ1](units), especially [Catapult%20%28Civ1%29](Catapults), and later [Armor%20%28Civ1%29](Armor) units. 
On an [Earth%20%28map%29%20%28Civ1%29](Earth map), his civilization will usually conquer Eurasian rivals very quickly, as his starting position among [Forest%20%28Civ1%29](forests) and [River%20%28Civ1%29](rivers) is very conducive towards building units quickly. On large land masses he is as dangerous as any leader out there.
