"Brave New World".
Available for purchase in [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities) after adopting the [Mercenary%20Army%20%28Civ5%29](Mercenary Army) [Social%20policies%20%28Civ5%29](social policy), or from allied Militaristic [City-state%20%28Civ5%29](City-States) who offer it as their bonus troop once you have the ability to build Pikemen.
Strategy.
In vanilla "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)" and ', the Landsknecht is mainly interesting for its price, which is one-half that of a Pikeman. This, and the fact that they don't require resources, allows a German player to bring out a number of them very fast. Then it is the old "Zerg rush" strategy, and the Germans can start on their way to a [Domination%20victory%20%28Civ5%29](domination victory)!
In "", the Landsknecht becomes available only after adopting Mercenary Army in the [Commerce%20%28Civ5%29](Commerce) social policy tree, but it is now available to all civilizations once they research [Civil%20Service%20%28Civ5%29](Civil Service). This unit still retains its half price compared to a normal [Pikeman%20%28Civ5%29](Pikeman), but in addition, it possesses unique [Promotions%20%28Civ5%29](promotions) that allow it to pillage [List%20of%20improvements%20in%20Civ5](improvements) at no cost and to pillage twice as much from cities. These features make the unit an interesting representation of actual real-life mercenaries, only interested in war as far as it enriches them.
More importantly, however, is that the Landsknecht is the only unit that can move and attack on the same turn it is purchased.
This unit is great if you need a unit immediately, especially for defense.
