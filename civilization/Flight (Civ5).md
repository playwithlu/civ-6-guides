# Flight (Civ5)

Game Info.
The Flight technology allows man to conquer the skies, just as he conquered the seas in the dawn of history. The airplanes created by it are immediately used for war purposes, of course, and such is their power and capabilities that they force a fundamental change in military strategy and tactics in modern times.
Because of that, quick discovery of Flight and development of an air force is paramount for any civilization willing to stay ahead of - or at least to keep up with - its competitors in modern times. It also improves the yield of the French and Polynesian unique improvements, giving +1 and +2 per [Chateau%20%28Civ5%29](Chateau) and +1 per [Moai%20%28Civ5%29](Moai).
