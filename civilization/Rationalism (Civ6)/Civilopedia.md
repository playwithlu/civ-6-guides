# Rationalism (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Rationalism is the worldview that looks to reason (rather than, say, blind faith or magic mushrooms) to explain the world. In this philosophy, reason trumps all other ways of knowing things, including any data gathered by one's five senses. Its roots can be traced back to the great Socrates, but it enjoyed something of a resurgence following Christian repression during the 16th and 17th centuries during the Scientific Revolution. Scientist-philosophers such as Réne Descartes, labelled the “father of modern philosophy,” Spinoza, Leibniz, and Kant altered the way humans viewed their world in profound ways and made rationalism the new faith.
