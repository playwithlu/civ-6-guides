Great Library entry.
In World War II, the Germans developed the V-1 missile, which was the precursor to the modern cruise missile developed by the United States and the Soviet Union in the 1960s and '70s. Carrying either a conventional or a nuclear warhead, they are designed to fly relatively slow and close to the ground, to minimize radar detection.
