Civilopedia entry.
The concept of The Republic first appeared in ancient Rome, where the local provinces sent representatives to the Senate to govern the nation. The head of state in a Republic was an elected representative, not a Monarch. The concept was revived in the Constitution of the United States, and many nations of significant size and diverse make-ups have adopted something similar. The Republic allowed unprecedented freedom, at least to a significant portion of the citizens, and this in turn often fostered strong economic growth.
