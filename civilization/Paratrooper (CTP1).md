In the 1980's and 1990's, the U.S. Army increasingly focused on rapidly deployed forces, relying on air transportation to establish a holding force until slower sea transports converged on the regional hot spot. Paratroopers were able to conduct this mission perfectly. Quiet and covert, they were able to drop anywhere within a range of over two thousand miles to disrupt the enemy zones of control.
