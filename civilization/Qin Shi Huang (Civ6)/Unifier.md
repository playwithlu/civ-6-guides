Intro.
 In your people lies your greatest strength, Emperor Qin Shi Huang. From all over the world, others will come to gaze upon the great walls and towering wonders of your united China. May the hands of your men never blister as they work hard and fast to raise the most impressive structures that the world will ever know. Protect them well, and you will forever be immortalized.
In-Game.
Qin Shi Huang's unique [Agenda%20%28Civ6%29](agenda) is Sihai. He wants Barbarians to follow his side, dislikes [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) that destroy [Barbarian%20%28Civ6%29%23Outposts](Barbarian outposts) and likes those who leave Barbarians alone.
His [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader ability) is Thirty-Six Stratagems. His melee units gain access to the unique Convert Barbarians action, which will consume the [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](unit) but transform all adjacent Barbarians into Chinese units.
Detailed Approach.
Qin is best when he lets Barbarians begin their invasion, and then turns them over to his side, a strategy that may involve sacrificing a Melee unit to get an army of Barbarians. He can further protect his empire with the [Great%20Wall%20%28Civ6%29](Great Wall's) added defense and the [Crouching%20Tiger%20%28Civ6%29](Crouching Tiger). Use his extra [Boost%20%28Civ6%29](Eurekas and Inspirations) to unlock more powerful units, and move forward to a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Domination%20Victory](Domination victory) with your Barbarian converts.
Lines.
Qin Shi Huang is voiced by [Junchao%20Huang](Junchao Huang). He speaks , though he utilizes the vocabulary and grammar reserved for scholars and government officials in Ancient Imperial China.
Notably, Qin Shi Huang uses the pronoun "寡人" ("guǎ rén") to address himself (instead of "朕" ("zhèn"), the personal pronoun reserved for emperors), even though this pronoun was used by vassal kings, such as Qin Shi Huang himself before he became the emperor of China. According to "", Qin Shi Huang used "朕" ("zhèn") for 9 years, from 221 to 212 BCE, then changed to "真人" ("zhēn rén", a term very closely related to Taoism) due to his obsession with seeking immortality, shortly before his death in 210 BCE.
