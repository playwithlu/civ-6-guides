# Mechanized Labor (Civ4)/Final Frontier/Civilopedia

Many of the rapid-fire discoveries brought about by the first Technocracies remained in use long after their development, but few can match the grandeur of the "Guild" Mechanized Workforce. The most important leap forward in robotics in many centuries, the Mechanized Workforce, with its general purpose "Novice" bots and specialized "Master" machines, were the first examples of semi-creative machinery using highly advanced AI routines. The class Anti-Ship Missile was actually conceived, designed and manufactured by "Sophocles," the world's third mechanical Master craftsbot. These "Guild" Workforces excelled at even more mundane of tasks, and all contemporary Mining Facilities owe their success to the mechanical manpower of the indefatigable systems.
