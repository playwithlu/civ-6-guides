# Bear (Civ4)

The Bear is a barbarian [Animal%20%28Civ4%29](animal) unit in "[Civilization%20IV](Civilization IV)".
Strategy.
With 3 strength, Bears are the strongest wild animals in the game. Like other animal units, they spawn only in the early game and cannot enter a civilization's cultural borders.
[Scout%20%28Civ4%29](Scouts) receive a 100% combat strength bonus when fighting Bears. Be sure to protect any [Settler%20%28Civ4%29](Settlers) that leave your territory with Scouts or military units if Bears are nearby.
Trivia.
In the other "Civilization" games, Bears that appear on the map usually represent a trade good (such as [Furs](Furs)) rather than a computer-controlled unit.
