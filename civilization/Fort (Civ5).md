# Fort (Civ5)

Game Info.
Defensive improvement. Requires [Engineering%20%28Civ5%29](Engineering).
Strategy.
A Fort is a special improvement that increases a tile's defensive bonus. Use it to defend choke points in your [Territory%20%28Civ5%29](territory), in regions likely to suffer an enemy invasion. Forts are especially effective when built on [Hill%20%28Civ5%29](Hills), because they combine their defensive bonus with the [Terrain%20%28Civ5%29](terrain's) defensive bonus.
[Unit%20%28Civ5%29](Units) which ignore terrain bonuses, such as siege units, do not receive any benefit from Forts.
Note that when a unit attacks from a tile with a Fort, it doesn't receive any bonus - the bonus to Combat Strength applies only when a unit inside the Fort's tile is attacked.
