# Land Ironclad (Civ5)

Game Info.
First landship unit. Strong against other land units but weak against airships.
Strategy.
The most basic type of landship unit, the Land Ironclad is well armored and shines in the ground combat. Use it to easily defeat primitive land units and wear down cities for capture. Its armor will somewhat protect it against the smaller guns of [Flyer%20%28ESS%29](Flyers), but it is very vulnerable to cannon fire from [Airship%20%28ESS%29](Airships).
