Economic Union combines the effects of [Town%20Charters%20%28Civ6%29](Town Charters) and [Naval%20Infrastructure%20%28Civ6%29](Naval Infrastructure), doubling the [Adjacency%20bonus%20%28Civ6%29](adjacency bonuses) of [Commercial%20Hub%20%28Civ6%29](Commercial Hubs) and [Harbor%20%28Civ6%29](Harbors). Considering that it becomes available around the same time as the much more useful [Market%20Economy%20%28Civ6%29](Market Economy), it's hard to justify using an Economic slot on it.
