# Monastery (Civ6)

Provides +15 HP healing every turn for friendly religious units 
The Monastery is a special [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](tile improvement) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It can be built by a player that is the {{Link6|Suzerain}} of the {{Link6|Armagh}} {{Link6|city-state}}.
Strategy.
Before the release of "", the Monastery is a largely useless improvement even for a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Religion](Religious Victory) player. A yield of 2 {{Faith6}} per improvement is negligible, and withdrawing all your religious units to your [Territory%20%28Civ6%29](territory) to heal up is impractical when considering how narrow the window of opportunity is for a Religious Victory. On a Standard-sized or larger [Map%20%28Civ6%29](map), no one should ever spend turns to march their religious units to a [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) halfway across the map, get them damaged, march them back home to heal and mobilize them again. Armagh's Suzerainty, therefore, should almost always be dead last on your priority list.
After the release of "Gathering Storm", however, the Monastery receives a buff that makes it actually useful: it provides +1 {{Housing6}} per improvement (+2 {{Housing6}} with [Colonialism%20%28Civ6%29](Colonialism), as long as it's within 3 [hex](hex)es of a [City%20Center%20%28Civ6%29](City Center)) with additional {{Faith6}} based on adjacent {{District6}}s. Remember, 1 {{Housing6}} in the early game is worth 2 [Farm%20%28Civ6%29](Farms), [Plantation%20%28Civ6%29](Plantations), [Pasture%20%28Civ6%29](Pastures), and/or [Camp%20%28Civ6%29](Camps), and this improvement can be placed on any land [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tile) not adjacent to another Monastery, unlike many other civilizations' unique tile improvements. The Monastery alone can pretty much single-handedly solve every {{Housing6}} issue that a civilization can run into, so civilizations with {{Food6}} bonuses like [Indian%20%28Civ6%29](India), the [Khmer%20%28Civ6%29](Khmer), and the [Incan%20%28Civ6%29](Inca) should definitely compete for Suzerainty of Armagh.
