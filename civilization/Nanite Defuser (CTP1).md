In 2817 a renegade nanological engineer, Richard Pax, unleashed the Nanite defuser on an unsuspecting world. The defuser actually consisted of millions of airborne nanites which Pax had designed to detect, locate, and consume plutonium. While the Defuser was successful, nuclear plants and submarines were destroyed as nanites breached their cores in search of plutonium.
