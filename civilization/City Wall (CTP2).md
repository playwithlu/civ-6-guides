Great Library entry.
From the first iterations of human civilization, nations have always needed protection from interlopers, human or otherwise. Early settlements utilized their environments to provide security for their communities. The Anasazi Indians built their homes directly into the face of cliffs for protection, whereas, the Aztecs built their capitol in the center of a lake, accessible only by narrow, and easily defensible, causeways. By the first millennium BC, many cities, most notably Greek and Roman cities, employed walls comprised of thick stones and bricks. Gates and guard towers could regulate traffic in and out of a city, and the walls compelled hostile forces to employ costly siege weapons in order to overtake a city.
