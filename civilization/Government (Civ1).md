# Government (Civ1)

In the original "[Civilization%20%28original%29](Civilization)" there are 6 types of governments. They are listed here with the technology required. For a change of government you must fall in a revolution that automatically puts you in Anarchy for several turns, and then you can switch to the new government.
[Pyramids%20%28Civ1%29](The Pyramids) wonder allow a change of government with minimal anarchy wait.
