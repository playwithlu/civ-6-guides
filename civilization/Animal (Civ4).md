# Animal (Civ4)

In the early game, the first [Barbarian%20%28Civ4%29](barbarians) that may be generated are wild animals. There are four kinds of wild animals, which vary only in their strength and movement:
Unlike other barbarians, animals can neither move nor attack into any [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ4](civilization's) [Borders%20%28Civ4%29](cultural borders). If you build a [City%20%28Civ4%29](city) next to an animal, it is relocated outside of the city's border.
[Scout%20%28Civ4%29](Scouts) have +100% combat strength against animals. A unit with 5 or more [experience](experience) gains no additional experience from fighting animals.
