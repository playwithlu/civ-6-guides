Victoria is a polite and gentle young lady as long as she is getting her way. But if you don't let her on your [Continent%20%28Civ6%29](continent), she is not amused!
This is the standard version of Victoria when players do not have the [Rulers%20of%20England%20Pack%20%28Civ6%29](Rulers of England Pack) enabled. When it is enabled, Victoria will be split into two alternate [Persona%20%28Civ6%29](personas): [Victoria%20%28Civ6%29/Age%20of%20Steam](Age of Steam Victoria), with a new appearance and abilities, and Age of Empire Victoria, using her former model and abilities.
Intro.
 Your Majesty the Queen Victoria of England, extend your reach beyond your borders and across the face of the globe. Worry not over the possibility of defeat for your loyal redcoats and overwhelming navy will surely carry the day. With your calm and steady touch you can bring all lands under England's sway, establishing a true Pax Britannica.
In-Game.
Victoria's unique [Agenda%20%28Civ6%29](agenda) is Sun Never Sets. She desires expansion to all the continents on the [Map%20%28Civ6%29](map), likes civilizations on her home continent, and dislikes civilizations on continents where she doesn't have [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities).
Her [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader ability) is Pax Britannica. Founded cities outside of her home continent receive a free [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Melee](melee unit), and another one if a [Royal%20Navy%20Dockyard%20%28Civ6%29](Royal Navy Dockyard) is built there. It also grants access to the [Redcoat%20%28Civ6%29](Redcoat) [Unique%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](unique unit) when the [Military%20Science%20%28Civ6%29](Military Science) technology is researched. In "" this ability has been changed; while she keeps the Redcoat, now only the first city founded on each continent other than her home continent is granted a free melee unit, but also grants +1 capacity. It also now grants a free naval unit upon building a [Royal%20Navy%20Dockyard%20%28Civ6%29](Royal Navy Dockyard) in any city, regardless of its continent; both of these free units will be the strongest she is capable of training.
Detailed Approach.
England (and Victoria) are masters of projecting British power across the globe to every continent. Initially she will use the Royal Naval Dockyard and her [Sea%20Dog%20%28Civ6%29](Sea Dogs) to gain control of the seas, and then move in with Redcoats during the [Industrial%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Industrial era) and lock down her positions across the globe. This extended reach will complement England's doubled Archaeology, allowing them to get a big jump toward a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Culture Victory).
