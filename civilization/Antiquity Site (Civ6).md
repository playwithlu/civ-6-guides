# Antiquity Site (Civ6)

An {{AntiquitySiteIcon6}} Antiquity Site is a special [Resource%20%28Civ6%29](resource) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It appears on any type of passable land [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tile) (even those that generally preclude resources, such as [Floodplains%20%28Civ6%29](Floodplains) and [Oasis%20%28Civ6%29](Oases)) after discovering [Natural%20History%20%28Civ6%29](Natural History).
Strategy.
An [Archaeologist%20%28Civ6%29](Archaeologist) who works an {{AntiquitySiteIcon6}} Antiquity Site will remove it from the [Map%20%28Civ6%29](map) and excavate an {{Artifact6}} [Great%20Work%20%28Civ6%29%23Artifacts](Artifact). A single Archaeologist can work multiple {{AntiquitySiteIcon6}} Antiquity Sites (usually 3) to complete the collection of its [City%20%28Civ6%29](city's) [Archaeological%20Museum%20%28Civ6%29](Archaeological Museum).
Considering that {{AntiquitySiteIcon6}} Antiquity Sites prevent further development of their tile until their {{Artifact6}} Artifacts have been excavated, it becomes almost imperative to produce Archaeologists quickly so that you can at least remove the {{Artifact6}} Artifacts in your [Territory%20%28Civ6%29](territory). You can safely ignore the ones that are underneath districts or existing improvements that you don't intend to replace, but each {{Artifact6}} Artifact exhibited in a Museum provides a nice bonus to {{Culture6}}, which comes in handy even to non-[Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Culture Victory) pursuing players.
An {{AntiquitySiteIcon6}} Antiquity Site produced by a Tribal Village will only provide {{Artifact6}} Artifacts from the [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) that activated it. Therefore, it may be helpful to pin the sites of Tribal Villages.
Settling a city on an {{AntiquitySiteIcon6}} Antiquity Site will remove it without excavating an {{Artifact6}} Artifact.
