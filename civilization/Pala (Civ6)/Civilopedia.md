# Pala (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Between the start of their dynasty in 750 CE and decline four centuries later, the Pala Dynasty distinguished themselves patrons of Buddhism in the region. It was the kind of patronage which would allow Mahayana Buddhism to emerge throughout Southeast Asia in the second half of the first millennium.
And much of that influence came from their support for the monk Atisha (or Ati≈õa). Born in 982 under the name Candragarbhaa, he was member of the royal family.
As a monk, he would travel to the kingdom of Srivijaya, starting in 1013, where he would study for 12 years (likely returning to India in 1025 to avoid the political tumult starting to kick up in Srivijaya at the time).
His travels (and his family's influence) are best known for his time in Tibet, where he would distinguish himself among the locals and reintroduce them to Mahayana Buddhism.
