# Long-Range Weapons (Civ4)/Final Frontier/Civilopedia

Advancements in predictive machinery greatly increased the feasible range of modern weaponry. To combat the growing rise in indirect Carrier-based warfare, extended-range Battleships took to the stars, giving the Capital ships a tactical advantage for the first time in many years. The application of intuitive computers to smaller arms had a significantly longer development time, but once sufficiently encapsulated intuitive computers were designed, new Invasion Ships quickly adopted the machines. And in the domestic realm, intuitive computers made the reasonable enforcement of law and order a job capable of being handled by a single agency, creating the first, truly effective IC-guided Policy Agencies in the universe.
