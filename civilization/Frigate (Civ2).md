# Frigate (Civ2)

The Frigate is a sea unit in "[Civilization%20II](Civilization II)".
Civilopedia entry.
The frigate was a fast and powerful sailing warship that evolved to fill several important naval roles, primarily to raid enemy shipping. These three masted ships were lighter and faster than the European great ship or man-of-war, and usually carried 36 or fewer guns. The frigate was powerful enough to overcome most of its prospective opponents and fast enough to escape those it could not outgun. Because of their speed and strength, frigates were often employed as escorts for merchant vessels during times of war. The frigate remained the most useful and dominant naval vessel until the development of the ironclad.
