# Expel (CTP2)

Leaders who wish to remove an enemy {{LinkCTP2|Stealth Unit}} (such as a {{LinkCTP2|Diplomat}}, {{LinkCTP2|Slaver}} or {{LinkCTP2|Lawyer}}) or non-military unit (such as a {{LinkCTP2|Settler}}, {{LinkCTP2|Urban Planner}} or {{LinkCTP2|Sea Engineer}}) from their own territory without attacking it (and thus angering one's rivals) can opt to Expel the unwanted unit. The Expelled unit takes no damage. It is simply moved to the nearest friendly city. This action does not affect diplomatic {{LinkCTP2|Regard}} in any way.
