It becomes available after researching [Offworld%20Mission%20%28Civ6%29](Offworld Mission) and completing the [Exoplanet%20Expedition%20%28Civ6%29](Exoplanet Expedition) project, and requires a [Spaceport%20%28Civ6%29](Spaceport) [District%20%28Civ6%29](district). 
This project builds a high-tech laser station that shoots an ultracharged high-precision beam toward the exoplanet spacecraft to power it up.
