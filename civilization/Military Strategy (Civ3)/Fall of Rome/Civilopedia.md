# Military Strategy (Civ3)/Fall of Rome/Civilopedia

The study of strategy and tactics has been an important part of thorough military training for many centuries.
The study of strategy involves analyzing past wars and battles by discussing what the opposing commanders'
strategies were, and the tactics each employed to carry out his plan of battle. In more modern times schools
dedicated to the study of all things military have been established. Battles might be gamed out on "sand tables"
or on paper, and the results analyzed. The ultimate goal of these institutions is to produce a cadre of soldiers
well versed in modern strategy and tactics, capable of leading their nation's military in time of battle.
