# Institution of the Muses (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Founded in approximately the Third Century BCE, the “Institution of the Muses” at Alexandria brought the brightest scientific, artistic, and philosophic minds together to teach, create, and wax philosophic. Similar to the modern concept of a university, the “Musaeum” may have hosted a young Archimedes (prior to his own Eureka moment).
