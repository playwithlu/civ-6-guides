# C-evo advances affecting ground units

Many of [C-evo](C-evo)'s [advance%20%28C-evo%29](advance)s add some factor to future [unit%20%28C-evo%29](unit) design or allow a [building%20%28C-evo%29](building) that strengthens all units in a [city%20%28C-evo%29](city). Conversely, some advances made by your opponents may reduce the effect of your units.
"Notes: 
"This shows effects on other units where an advance affects them too"
"The Manual divides advances into four groups, based roughly on chronology, but an alphabetical listing has advantages and is used here. Other arrangements of these data are possible and are likely to be created as alternatives by selective copying from this table when it has all links in."
"Abbreviations:
""Cost to" stands for "[Cost%20multiplier%20%28C-evo%29](Cost multiplier) increased to"; "Cost +" (used for a [Future%20Technology%20%28C-evo%29](Future Technology)) means [Cost%20multiplier%20%28C-evo%29](Cost multiplier) increases by the specified amount; see http://c-evo.org/forum/p-397-1.html and http://c-evo.org/forum/p-397-1-1-1.html for relevant forum postings about cost
""Max wt" stands for "Maximum [weight%20%28C-evo%29](weight) [of that type of unit] rises to"
""Str" stands for "[Strength%20multiplier%20%28C-evo%29](Strength multiplier)"
""Trans" stands for "[Transport%20multiplier%20%28C-evo%29](Transport multiplier)"
 The term "multiplier" may seem misleading for "additive" "factors" but is correct.
Advances for strength of future ground unit designs.
If you start designing ground units after researching Warrior Code but no other relevant advances, the strength of your basic attack module ("weapons") and of your basic defensive module ("armor") is 4. Each relevant advance researched will add to each module's strength the number shown.
Note that the boosts are not necessarily greater for "higher" advances
Maximum numbers of specific modules.
Initially you are allowed either one or two armor modules. The researching of [Steel%20%28C-evo%29](Steel) raises the maximum to three. There is no fixed maximum for weapons modules or speed enhancements but they all use up part of the weight quota.
(including the basic 4)
"See more detail at the [Ground%20units%20%28C-evo%29](Ground units (C-evo)) page"
Total strength at various stages.
Because some of the other desirable enhancements, such as the very common Artillery and rarer [Alpine%20%28C-evo%29](Alpine), may use some of the weight quota, the higher levels of attack or movement indicated above may be uncommon. Also, any nation may create overweight units that are stronger after researching [Bridge%20Building%20%28C-evo%29](Bridge Building), though AI nations rarely if ever do that.
It is often possible to work out which advances another nation used for any of its units that you encounter.
[Cost%20multiplier%20%28C-evo%29](Cost multiplier).
The cost per module:
In addition, the cost is increased by 2 for each advance you make in [Material%20Technology%20%28C-evo%29](Material Technology) (which requires you to have researched [Composites%20%28C-evo%29](Composites) and therefore starts from 15).
Some of the attributes you can include will add a little to the cost too. You see an indication of that on the design screen, where additions to cost or weight have appropriate icons.
Units available early in the game.
"Caution: creating units with no attack strength may be false economy, partly because they are defined as "[Civil%20unit%20%28C-evo%29](Civil unit)s" and cannot capture cities even if the city is unguarded so that you want to walk in."
"Note that quoted costs are for medium level of difficulty; each will be 25% lower if you are in easy mode and 25% higher if you are in insane mode; fractions are rounded down if there's a fraction above a whole number (e.g. 10 becomes 7 or 12)."
"When considering defensive strength, note that a unit that did not move in the previous turn has "an additional 50% strength bonus" from fortifying. (The game documentation is slightly ambiguous about what that is 50% of, but it is fairly certain to be just 50% of the basic defensive strength.)
Earliest possible units.
Existing designs.
Before designing any of your own, you can build [Militia](Militia) (6/6/1.5) and [Town%20Guard%20%28C-evo%29](Town Guard) (4/6/1.5 outside a city, 4/12/1.5 inside). If built after you have a [Barracks](Barracks), they will start life [hardened](hardened), as with any other ground units, i.e. with strengths 50% greater than the basic.
Designing new units.
All that you need is to research [Warrior%20Code%20%28C-evo%29](Warrior Code), which has no prerequisites and allows:
Minimum requirement is a single [armor%20%28C-evo%29](armor) module for defense, which takes two of the [weight%20%28C-evo%29](weight) allowance of five. You may add other modules up to the weight quota.
Minimum armor:
(with defensive strength of only 4 they will be vulnerable to fairly easy destruction by any other nation's basic [Militia%20%28C-evo%29](Militia) unit (6/6) unless they have a terrain bonus such as hill, forest, or jungle)
*0/4 costing 3 - but if you produce more than 3 resources per turn you may waste much of the surplus unless it is transferred to a subsequent building or more costly unit
*4/4 costing 6 - if built with a [Barracks](Barracks) it will initially equal a standard [Militia](Militia) built without a Barracks but cost about 40% fewer resources
*8/4 costing 9
*12/4 costing 12 - think of it as the first javelin-thrower, crouching in a city protected by stronger units but able to kill almost any primitive attacker foolish enough to stop too close
Double armor:
*0/8 costing 6 - a very safe early scout but unable to capture foreign cities
*4/8 costing 9 - a very safe early scout with better defense than a standard [Militia](Militia) and costing fewer resources
Onwards and upwards.
Next useful advances, available from the start, are Bronze Working for added strength and Horseback Riding for added "[weight](weight)" and mobility. Normally you would research both before doing any military research. Even with those, the combinations of modules are complex enough to deserve a separate article. Later other advances will allow even more complexity and choice as other attributes become available.
Fanaticism.
Units that are destroyed in battle may destroy their targets or attackers too. The discovery of [Communism%20%28C-evo%29](Communism) (requiring [Industrialization%20%28C-evo%29](Industrialization) and [Philosophy%20%28C-evo%29](Philosophy)), irrespective of whether you adopt that government type, allows you to spend a little more on the construction of air or ground units that are [Fanatic%20%28C-evo%29](Fanatic)s if you build that into their design: they fight harder, and if destroyed they deal the opponent twice the normal damage. If the normal damage would be 50% or more, the doubling means that the enemy is destroyed too. Kamikaze at its best.
Mass Production leads to final pushes.
Fairly late in the game, when you or a cooperative friend have researched [Mass%20Production%20%28C-evo%29](Mass Production), strength can be augmented with [Composites%20%28C-evo%29](Composites), The [Laser%20%28C-evo%29](Laser), and [Robotics%20%28C-evo%29](Robotics), and finally as many advances in [Material%20Technology%20%28C-evo%29](Material Technology) as you can manage while not neglecting other profitable advances.
A powerful attack unit you can design before any Material Technology would be 476/68/1.5 with [Artillery%20%28C-evo%29](Artillery), costing 135 resources to build.
Once you have researched Mass Production yourself, you will be able to design units for [Line%20Production](Line Production), which (without taking up any of the weight quota) gives you all except the first in a row at half the resource cost - ideal for combining with your [Military%20Academy%20%28C-evo%29](Military Academy).
