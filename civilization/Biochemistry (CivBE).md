# Biochemistry (CivBE)

Game Information.
Biochemistry is a [Secondary%20Tech%20%28CivBE%29](Secondary Tech) that can be researched from [Chemistry%20%28CivBE%29](Chemistry).
Biochemistry allows for the construction of a [Water%20Refinery%20%28CivBE%29](Water Refinery) and a [Petrochemical%20Plant%20%28CivBE%29](Petrochemical Plant).
There is no affinity linked to this technology.
In Universe information.
Dealing primarily with the structures, processes and interactions of macromolecules of living organisms, on the new world biochemistry concentrated primarily on the extraction and conversion of organic-based oils. It turned out the significant differences of alien molecular structure and chemical composition required an extensive overhaul of petrochemical production processes, before native sources of oil could be used to their full capacity; and the same was valid for other 'useful' natural products. Fortunately, after the initial concentrated effort in updating knowledge databases and developing additional techniques, local fossil fuels became useful, and further research into biochemistry was unnecessary. Funds were diverted into other, more pressing matters, but still, the initial results were more than satisfactory.
