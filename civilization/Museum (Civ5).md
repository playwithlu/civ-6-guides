# Museum (Civ5)

Game Info.
Advanced cultural building. Requires [Opera%20House%20%28Civ5%29](Opera House).
Strategy.
The Museum is the next step in increasing a city's {{Culture5}} output. 
In "" it contains 2 slots for [Great%20Work%20%28Civ5%29](Great Works of Art). These increase the total {{Culture5}} bonus to +5 (as in [vanilla](vanilla) "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)"), but also provide +4 {{Tourism5}} for your continued advancement towards a [Cultural%20victory%20%28Civ5%29](cultural victory). As if that weren't enough, the Museum is the only common building which provides a [Theming%20bonus%20%28Civ5%29](theming bonus) - if you fill both slots with either Great Works of Art or Artifacts, and both from either your [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilization) or from one or two civilizations other than you, and both from the same era, the +2 bonuses to {{Culture5}} and {{Tourism5}} will allow the Museum to generate a total of 7 {{Culture5}} and 6 {{Tourism5}}! If you fulfill only two of the theming requirements, it still provides a +1 bonus.
