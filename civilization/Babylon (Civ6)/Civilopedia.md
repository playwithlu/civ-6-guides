# Babylon (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Babylon’s earliest history is lost to the ages, recounted only in documents written by subsequent civilizations. Hammurabi’s rise to power in 18th Century BCE remains consistent in these accounts, for it ultimately transformed Babylon. Beyond consolidating his power along the Euphrates River, the Code of Hammurabi is one of the world’s oldest collections of writing. The code dictated laws of economics, the handling of criminals, and codified marriage (as well as divorce).
This early empire died with Hammurabi. During its decline, Babylon suffered numerous conquests, from Hittites, Kassites, and eventually Assyrians. The ascent of Nebuchadnezzar II led to a rebuilt and fortified Babylon, building the famous Hanging Gardens, and laid the framework for subsequent rulers.
Though Babylon would eventually fall under Persian and Macedonian rule, Alexander the Great instituted the rebuilding of its temples and established more trade routes after the city’s conquest in 331 BCE. Fortune seemed to favor the city—until Alexander’s death, when his generals “debated” who would rule the city, occasionally at spear-point. Savvy to the horrors of a succession crisis, most of Babylon’s citizens fled the city for the (relatively) less bloodstained Seleucia. Babylon’s importance waned abruptly.
