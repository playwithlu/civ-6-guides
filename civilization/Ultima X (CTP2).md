# Ultima X (CTP2)

Ultima X is a [List%20of%20scenarios%20in%20CTP2](scenario) based on a role-playing game (RPG) called "" that has been around since 1985 and was adapted for use in "[Call%20to%20Power%20II](Call to Power II)" in 2001. It can be downloaded from [Apolyton%20Civilization%20Site](Apolyton) or [WePlayCiv](WePlayCiv).
Introduction.
This scenario is set in a fantasy based world containing magic, dragons, goblins, wizards, witches, and other fantastic creatures such as the griffin and the giant octopus. The scenario only uses a couple of custom units; all of them were developed by [Activision](Activision). The game does not come with dragon, goblin, bat or wolf sprites; they have to be added later by editing the correct game files. The game only renamed Hoplites into Guards, Alexander into Avatar, Blue Legion into Lord British and a few other changes. The scenario does not have any set years for its turns. Each turn represents 3 months and is named after a season (Spring, Summer, etc.) without any year. The part of the world that is worth knowing covers the entire Britannia archipelago.
Eight nations of similar size, histories, and similar ages (levels of technology) are competing for dominance of the Britannia archipelago. Each has only a few thousand units of gold and a sprinkling of units. There is a large cluster of Paladin units approaching the Bards' southernmost city, and the Paladins are positioned to conquer it in a few turns. But other than this most other units on the map are evenly spread around it.
Advances and Wonders.
All civilizations in this scenario have a similar level of technology. Only one civilization (the Pirates) has discovered Slave Labor. Theology and Hull Making are other technologies that could be shared if you're trying to trade technologies. The least of the eight civilizations are the Druids and they have not discovered Hull Making, Slave Labor, or Theology. Another technology that some are working on is Iron Working, and so far no civilization has discovered it yet. Towards the end of the game great strides in technology can be made. Future technologies are possible but difficult to discover. In general terms the technology is set at [Renaissance%20era%20%28CTP2%29](Pre-Renaissance era) with the exception of some civilizations having discovered Hull Making or Theology. Wonders of the world are nowhere near as readily available as in the standard game. There are 10 wonders in the game that are renamed versions of the ones in the standard game.
Pollution.
When beginning the game none of the civilizations are polluting the map. Pollution from production is usually threatened if and occurring only after you discover Industrial revolution and have begun building Factories.
Diplomacy.
In this scenario you are meant to play as the Bards led by Lord British. All of the other civilizations begin at war with you. Your goal is to achieve a Bloodlust Victory (Conquest Victory). At low levels of difficulty it is possible to sign ceasefire agreements with other players so you can try to prepare for your plans to conquer all the areas on the map. Also other civilizations are more likely to exchange ambassadors and technology at lower levels of difficulty.
Trade Routes.
The rules of the scenario can still allow for the production of caravans and the establishment of trade routes. Due to the war that is in progress when you start the scenario its advisable to sign cease fire agreements. If you wish to get your civilization to earn gold from International Trade. Otherwise you will still need to build caravans if you are only interested in domestic trade.
