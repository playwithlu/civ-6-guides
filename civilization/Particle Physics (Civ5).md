# Particle Physics (Civ5)

Game Info.
As a futuristic science, Particle Physics doesn't have much application in everyday life yet, not even in the military (which normally is the first to benefit from all inventions). It does, however, make possible the construction of one of the most complex parts of a Spaceship - the [SS%20engine%20%28Civ5%29](Engine).
