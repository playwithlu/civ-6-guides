# Combat (C-evo)

In the free-to-play game "[C-evo](C-evo)", battle outcomes are not random but depend precisely on the relative strengths (with a couple of other factors occasionally entering the equation). Before attacking, you can call up a diagram that shows the strengths and the outcome. 
Who dies?
The losing [List%20of%20units%20in%20C-evo](unit) dies. The victor sustains damage, varying with its amount of superiority. However, if the loser was a [Fanatic%20%28C-evo%29](Fanatic), the victor sustains double damage (unless protected by [Sun%20Tzu](Sun Tzu)) and may therefore die too. If the strengths are equal (e.g., 12/8 attacking 18/12), both units die.
Raw or basic strengths.
Special units.
The special predesigned units have fixed raw strengths, the lowest attack strength (apart from the "0" of the [civil%20unit](civil unit)s) being that of the [Town%20Guard%20%28C-evo%29](Town Guard): 4.
Player-designed units.
Units designed by the players have their raw strengths determined by the relevant discovered [advances](advances) and by the number of weapons or armor modules that are built in.
