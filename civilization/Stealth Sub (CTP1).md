Summary.
Hiding from even the best sonar, the Stealth Sub attacks without warning, excelling at all-around combat, but especially merciless at ripping apart [Trade%20route%20%28CTP1%29](trade routes). The Stealth Sub can also be used to covertly transport up to four [Nuke%20%28CTP1%29](Nukes), which will go undetected as they travel the ocean depths.
Great Library entry.
Based on the latest chaos theory of Quantum Physics, the Stealth Sub uses a material similar to sharkskin to part the water and glide at near zero friction and noise. This allows the Sub to concentrate on active and passive sonar avoidance: using thermal layers to deflect sonar pulses and using a magneto-hydro-dynamic pulsar engine to slip past listening microphones.
