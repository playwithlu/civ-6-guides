# Grande Armée (Civ6)

Grande Armée is a Military [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
Grande Armée will boost your military [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](units') training speed significantly. It can be very useful for those aiming for a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Domination](Domination Victory) to start prepping up for a late-game war to overthrow the last few [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) that remain after the early-game conquests. (And if you haven't done some early game conquering, why are you still aiming for a Domination Victory?)
However, civilizations reacting to a war declared by a stronger enemy could also use this policy effectively, and come up with an army where before there were only easy pickings for the enemy.
Note that the bonus does not apply to [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Siege](siege units)! So if you are the defending side and suddenly you are now counter-attacking, this policy will not be useful for training machines to take down enemy [Walls%20%28Civ6%29](walls).
