# Fighter Bomber (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Aircraft were especially valuable in the Pacific theatre, with its heavy emphasis on air and naval power.
Naturally, all involved countries continued to research and field better aircraft as the war progressed.
The Fighter Bomber generically represents more powerful late-war fighters, such as the P-38 Lightning, with a
longer range than the fighter, and capable of carrying a larger, more potent payload.
