# A/D/M

A/D/M is the abbreviation meaning "Attack strength/Defense strength/Movement points". It is used mainly for "[Sid%20Meier%27s%20Civilization](Civ1)" because later games introduce [hit%20points](hit points) as an additional numerical attribute. The higher the number, the better in battle the unit will be.
