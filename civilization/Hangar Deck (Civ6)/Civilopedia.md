# Hangar Deck (Civ6)/Civilopedia

It proved unhandy to keep a carrier’s planes all tied down on the flight deck; the aircraft were subject to weather, rough seas, and enemy attentions. By the time of World War II, Japanese and American fleet carriers often carried two or more fighter squadrons, a couple of torpedo-bomber squadrons, at least one dive bomber squadron, and several scout planes. There was not nearly enough room up top for these 80 to 100 planes on a typical carrier. Thus, between the wars naval designers incorporated a “hangar deck” – a carrier’s garage – on the latest. Located two decks below the flight deck, the hangar deck on the USS Eisenhower for instance is 110 feet wide, 25 feet high and 685 feet long … plenty of room for 60 planes, as well as fuel tanks and heavy repair equipment.
