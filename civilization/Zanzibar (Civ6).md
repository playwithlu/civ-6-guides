# Zanzibar (Civ6)

Zanzibar is a trade [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-state) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". 
Strategy.
Zanzibar is a strong and heavily-contested city-state due to its large {{Amenity6}} bonus (12 {{Amenities6}} in total). Due to the fact that going wide is always better than going tall in "Civilization VI", suzerainty of Zanzibar can support up to 12 [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities), more than any other sources of {{Amenity6}} bonus. Since its bonus can be utilized well by pretty much anyone, you need to dedicate a lot of {{Envoy6}} power to gain its suzerainty.
