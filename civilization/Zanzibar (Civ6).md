# Zanzibar (Civ6)

Zanzibar is a trade [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-state) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". 
Strategy.
Zanzibar is a strong and heavily-contested city-state due to its large bonus (12 in total). Due to the fact that going wide is always better than going tall in "Civilization VI", suzerainty of Zanzibar can support up to 12 [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities), more than any other sources of bonus. Since its bonus can be utilized well by pretty much anyone, you need to dedicate a lot of power to gain its suzerainty.
