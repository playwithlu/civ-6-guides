Gameplay.
Ballistae are massive projectile weapons, fashioned much like a giant crossbow. They are capable of firing huge bolts of wood, often as large as 5 feet in length, a considerable distance. Although primarily developed as a siege weapon, ballistae are effective defense weapons, delivering heavy damage to oncoming armies. Positioned high on the walls of a city, the ballista towers offer offensive bonuses against land-based attackers. 
Great Library entry.
Ballistae were ancient heavy missile launchers used to hurl large bolts, javelins or heavy balls great distances. Smaller ballistae, like those in ballista towers, were essentially large crossbows fastened to a mount. The smaller ballistae were better suited to defense against siege weapons and infantry attacks and were often perched high on the towers of towns and castles to rain a variety of projectiles on charging armies.
