# Mesopotamia (Civ3)

 is a [List%20of%20scenarios%20in%20Civ3](scenario) in "".
Description.
Mesopotamia is the "cradle of civilization" and was home to all seven of the "Great Wonders of the Ancient World." The map stretches from the mountains of Greece east to the hills of Persia and south to the Nile river. The game ends as soon as all seven great wonders have been built, or when a side amasses 5500 VP, or after 160 turns -- whichever happens first. Victory points awarded for completing wonders are doubled in this scenario.
Intro.
It is 4000 BC -- the dawn of civilization. Your distant ancestors were nomads, but over the generations they have become skilled at "farming", and are now ready to settle down in small communities.
Background.
The Mesopotamian basin and the shores of the Mediterranean Sea witnessed the rise of many great civilizations, such as Sumeria, Egypt, Mycenae, Babylon, Phoenicia, Hatti, and Medea. Are you ready to grasp firm the reins of power and lead the people to greatness?
Special.
Once your people have mastered Sailing they will be able to build Curraghs -- small boats useful for exploring coastal areas. The tall forests of cedars along the shores of the eastern Mediterranean should be especially valuable for resources and commerce.
Victory.
"Wonder" victory conditions are in effect. As soon as the last of the seven Great Wonders of the World has been completed the game immediately ends and Victory is assessed based on each side's score. The game also ends as soon as any civilization amasses over 5500 victory points. Otherwise, the game ends after 160 turns, and the victor will be the side with the highest score.
Gameplay.
Seven [Civilizations%20%28Civ3%29](civilizations) appear in this scenario - [Egyptian%20%28Civ3%29/Mesopotamia](Egypt), [Mycenaean%20%28Civ3%29](Mycenae), [Babylonian%20%28Civ3%29](Babylon), the [Medean%20%28Civ3%29](Medes), [Phoenician%20%28Civ3%29](Phoenicia), [Sumerian%20%28Civ3%29](Sumeria), and the [Hittite%20%28Civ3%29](Hittites) - and all of them are playable. Since the scenario is set in ancient times, many things that are normally available at the beginning of the game are unavailable until the appropriate [List%20of%20advances%20in%20Civ3](advances) have been discovered - for example, [Cattle%20%28Civ3%29](Cattle) don't appear on the [Map%20%28Civ3%29](map) and [Worker%20%28Civ3%29](Workers) cannot build [Irrigation%20%28Civ3%29](Irrigation) or [Mine%20%28Civ3%29](Mines). Additionally, many of the [List%20of%20wonders%20in%20Civ3](wonders) have [List%20of%20resources%20in%20Civ3](resource) requirements that they don't have in a standard game.
[Victory%20%28Civ3%29](Victory) goes to the first civilization to score 5500 [Victory%20Points](Victory Points), or to the civilization with the most VP after all seven Great Wonders are built or 160 [turn](turn)s elapse.
VP are used to keep score in this scenario, and are awarded as follows:
