# Mobile SAM (Civ5)

Strategy.
Mobile SAM (Surface-to-Air Missile) units are the modern airplane destroyers, replacing the older guns with new and far deadlier rocket-launching platforms. The rockets can track their aerial targets, improving both damage and accuracy.
These units are quite powerful altogether at the time they become available, but later when the other unit classes upgrade, they become fairly vulnerable to non-air attack and should be accompanied by infantry or armor at all times. The Mobile SAM is the best anti-air defense in the game.
