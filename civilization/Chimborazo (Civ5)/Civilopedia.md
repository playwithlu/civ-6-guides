# Chimborazo (Civ5)/Civilopedia

Chimborazo is a 20,500-foot stratovolcano (last eruption around 550 AD) in the Cordillera Occidental of the Andes. Widely believed by Europeans to be the highest peak in the world before the Himalayas were discovered, it was first climbed by an English-Italian team guided by Ecuadorian natives in 1880.
