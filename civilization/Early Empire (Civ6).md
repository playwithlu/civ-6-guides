# Early Empire (Civ6)

Early Empire is an [Ancient%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Ancient Era) [Civic%20%28Civ6%29](civic) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It can be hurried by growing your civilization to at least 6 Population. 
Strategy.
History has proven that a strong state wishes to subjugate other states, whether by force of arms or by economic force. Mighty rulers are greedy by definition; otherwise they would be neither mighty, nor rulers. Thus, defining the borders of an empire and defending these borders becomes as important as expanding them.
After developing this Civic, a civilization's borders become "inviolate" - that is, if anyone enters them without permission, it constitutes an act of war. At the same time, you are granted the opportunity to "allow" other states into your borders, whether as a part of a diplomatic trade, or as an act of kindness (understand "bribe" - there is no kindness in diplomacy!).
