# Flyer (Civ5)

Game Info.
Excellent against airships, but not very strong against land units. It also has a limited range, and must base at a city or [Sky%20Fortress%20%28unit%29%20%28Civ5%29](Sky Fortress).
Strategy.
Flyers have a short range and a moderate attack. They excel at hit and run tactics, especially against airships and Sky Fortresses, which are too bulky to effectively dodge their strikes. Their limited range restricts them to mostly defensive roles at first, but later on the Sky Fortress can act as their mobile base, transporting them to directly into the battlefield.
