# Sailing (Civ6)

Sailing is an [Ancient%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Ancient Era) [Technology%20%28Civ6%29](technology) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It can be hurried by founding a [Coastal%20%28Civ6%29](coastal) [City%20%28Civ6%29](city).
Strategy.
This is the basic maritime technology - the ability to construct vessels with which to enter the shallow seas and access their bountiful products. For now only the most basic boats can be constructed, which depend mostly on rowing power, and can only operate on [Coast%20%28Civ6%29](Coast) [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles). Still, it is an important beginning - humankind can now use sea-born [Resource%20%28Civ6%29](resources), and has made the first hesitant steps into the water medium.
Sailing is one of the first five techs which can be researched right from the start of the game, and an obligatory tech for any [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) which wants to do stuff in the water. But unless you're a seafaring civ whose main resources are in the water, you have no particular incentives to make it your first research. There are usually more important techs. In fact, if you're a landlocked civ, you can forgo researching Sailing until the [Medieval%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Medieval Era), when you'll need it to research [Buttress%20%28Civ6%29](Buttress)...or, if you have no particular use of [Dam%20%28Civ6%29](Dams) or the [Hagia%20Sophia%20%28Civ6%29](Hagia Sophia), until the [Renaissance%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Renaissance Era), when you'll need to research this branch to continue to [Industrialization%20%28Civ6%29](Industrialization).
