# Advance (Civ3)

Civilization advances or technologies are researched using the [Science%20%28Civ3%29](science) generated by a [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ3](civilization). They make new [List%20of%20buildings%20in%20Civ3](city improvements), [List%20of%20wonders%20in%20Civ3](wonders), [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ3](units) and later technologies available to a civilization once unlocked by that civilization.
Technology costs.

Micro-optimization.
Since research spent in excess of a technology's cost is not carried over to the next technology, the player can generate a small amount of extra [Gold%20%28currency%29%20%28Civ3%29](gold) (or other yield) by reducing scientific spending and reassigning [Specialists%20%28Civ3%29](scientists) as a technology nears completion, often with zero cost in terms of how soon the technology is fully researched.
Free technology.
Upon completion of certain wonders, the player will receive a number of free technologies. In order to choose which technologies are free, as well as to save science/gold, it is suggested that the player -
One rare opportunity provided by free technology in scenario play is to research branches of the tech tree not normally available to the civilization: sometimes, the tech tree is designed with expensive technologies provided free to particular civilizations such that they can access the technologies downstream while other civilizations will find the research for that initial technology prohibitively expensive. Using free technologies to acquire the initial technology can lead to interesting gameplay (e.g., [French%20%28Civ3%29](France) having Muslim-branch technologies in [The%20Middle%20Ages%20%28Civ3%29](The Middle Ages) [List%20of%20scenarios%20in%20Civ3](scenario)).
