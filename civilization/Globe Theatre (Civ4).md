# Globe Theatre (Civ4)

Strategy.
The Globe Theatre removes all unhappiness from the [City%20%28Civ4%29](city) in which it is built. It increases its city's chance of generating a [Great%20Artist%20%28Civ4%29](Great Artist).
This wonder can allow you to [Draft%20%28Civ4%29](draft) large numbers of [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ4](units) without suffering the unhappiness penalty.
