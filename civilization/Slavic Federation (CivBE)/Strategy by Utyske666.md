# Slavic Federation (CivBE)/Strategy by Utyske666

A Slavic Federation Strategy.
Goals..
Hi guys, there's just a few weeks until launch, and we're all raring to go i'm sure. I have watched every post and video on Civ:BE, and by now have a good idea of its many new mechanics and features, so I thought you might like to evaluate my ideas on game tactics. There is a lot of cool stuff and new features I want to check out. As the headline suggests I will try the Slavic Federation, and aim for a fast [Spy%20Agency%20%28CivBE%29](Spy Agency) with that free tech. The Affinities I lean towards are [Harmony%20%28CivBE%29](Harmony) and [Supremacy%20%28CivBE%29](Supremacy) (being a bit of a science nerd), probably a good mix. I usually play Civ in a growth focused style, so {{HealthBE}} with the [Biowell%20%28CivBE%29](Biowell)s etc., will be an issue. A last cool idea I really need to try out is the 'Terrorscape' tactics, as Maddjinn coined the term. That is, Harmony doing lots of terra-scaping, which will demand tons of {{EnergyBE}}, and means going deep in the [Prosperity%20%28CivBE%29](Prosperity)-tree. 
Deciding Direction..
Sponsor.
As I said we are going with the [Slavic%20Federation%20%28CivBE%29](Slavic Federation) (SF) in this guide, and there are three reasons for this:
Now with regards to the free tech on the first satellite I have seen many just pop it at first notice, and others, like Maddjinn, hold off using it to get a high tier tech earlier. Both tactics are risky, so I want to do a fast pop, which gives a very long-time boost, with [Computing%20%28CivBE%29](Computing) and an early [Spy%20Agency%20%28CivBE%29](Spy Agency).
Seeding.
On the Choose Colonists screen I will go for Artists (+1 {{HealthBE}}, +2 {{CultureBE}} ), in order to mitigate the {{UnhealthBE}} of my growth focus. And because we want to go deep in the [Virtues%20%28CivBE%29](Virtue)-tree, we need to get fast {{CultureBE}}. I could go for the Aristocrats depending on my mood, for that extra {{EnergyBE}}.
At the Choose Spacecraft section I prefer to go for Tectonic Scanner, so we will know if we should focus getting the [Geothermal%20Well%20%28CivBE%29](Geothermal Well) going faster for extra Energy. Another favourite of mine is the Retrograde Thrusters which will enable getting the two best possible first cities.
With Choose Cargo I want to go for Laboratory for the free [Pioneering%20%28CivBE%29](Pioneering) so we can get some early trade before having to build the [Spy%20Agency%20%28CivBE%29](Spy Agency). Fast Pioneering also means getting trade up fast. It will also be quite advantageous to have a [Trade%20Convoy%20%28CivBE%29](Trade Convoy) ready to boost Outpost to City conversion.
On the Choose Planet screen I would go for an advanced planet. The main reason is that, terrascaping gives you access to vast improvements on otherwise worthless tiles, so we want to use the advanced options to get either a desert/arid setup, or use the advanced planet option to get a tundra setup with snow. Both will grant us a bonus to the scapes. With desert tiles we get +1 {{FoodBE}} from the [Vivarium%20%28CivBE%29](Vivarium), and on tundra tiles we get +1 {{EnergyBE}} from the [Mass%20Digester%20%28CivBE%29](Mass Digester).
The Startup..
Here in this setup I am assuming a Taigan planet, which of course has implications for tech choice. It is also quite clear that any choice in this guide is susceptible to 'environmental' factors, it is rather meant as guidelines.
Tech.
I intend to list my early/midgame tech choices here and explain my tactical considerations behind them and their priority:
Our first tech is picked to open up the path to Computing and [Spy%20Agency%20%28CivBE%29](Spy Agency). As soon as we have that we pop a [Solar%20Collector%20%28CivBE%29](Solar Collector) if we have one, or build a [Miasmic%20Repulsor%20%28CivBE%29](Miasmic Repulsor). Next we go straight for a Spy Agency, and assign the spies to cities to ramp up intrigue immediately with Energy siphoning. When possible I intend to go for stealing Science, and then rotate research to Terraforming each time we get within 1 turn of stealing.
Now Physics gives access to the [Ranger%20%28CivBE%29](Ranger), which we will need to clear out alien nests for our second Outpost. Any nest will leave behind a {{XenomassBE}} if cleared, so we should set up near them if possible.
Engineering is important for the {{EnergyBE}} from the [Thorium%20Reactor%20%28CivBE%29](Thorium Reactor), which should be constructed fast as it gives a quest to increase {{EnergyBE}}. It also opens up Geophysics with the [Geothermal%20Well%20%28CivBE%29](Geothermal Well.)
After this we pick Powersystems to get +{{EnergyBE}} on {{GeothermalBE}}, and land us a [Supremacy%20%28CivBE%29](Supremacy) boost to get the upgrade for our [Soldier%20%28CivBE%29](Soldier) unit. 
Alien Biology yields 12 [Harmony%20%28CivBE%29](Harmony) points, which will probably grant us an upgrade to our Ranger, and we also get that handy [Worker%20%28CivBE%29](Worker) Miasma immunity.
At this point the {{EnergyBE}} production should be able to sustain several [Terrascape%20%28CivBE%29](Terrascape)s, so lets go ahead and pick that [Terraforming](Terraforming).
The rest of the list is prioritized for more {{EnergyBE}} and [Affinity%20%28CivBE%29](Affinity) points, but be aware that conditions so far on in the game may change so much that the late part of the list might be revised as we play it out.
Production.
We should focus on a few important builds here in early game, as we will go directly to [Spy%20Agency%20%28CivBE%29](Spy Agency). My queue for the capitol should look like this:
The Worker unit is very important to get out, as we want to improve our {{FoodBE}} and {{ProductionBE}} yields fast.
We are going broad and deep in [Virtues%20%28CivBE%29](Virtues) so {{CultureBE}} early from that relic is imperative, and we will get a quest to increase {{CultureBE}} on relics. The [Trade%20Depot%20%28CivBE%29](Trade Depot) for the tiny Production is helpful, but the Trade Convoy for faster Outpost growth is very important as we will use a lot of time on Spy Agency. 
City 2 Production:
Again relic for more {{CultureBE}} and another Worker to grow fast is very important. As said before we may need to clear out [Aliens%20%28CivBE%29](Aliens), so 2 Rangers for some combined warfare is helpful now (keep Soldier on fortify in range of nest, and let Rangers stay just behind picking enemies off). The Clinic at this point as we probably have low {{HealthBE}} by now.
Tile Improvement.
In all my cities I generally go for 3 farms fast, at a river if possible, to bunk up the growth. Next I go for strategic resources. Prioritize [Paddock%20%28CivBE%29](Paddock) as it has nice {{FoodBE}} yields along with {{ProductionBE}}.
Virtues.
As said earlier the aim of this guide is to get [Terrascape%20%28CivBE%29](Terrascape)s, so we should go for the last [Prosperity](Prosperity)-virtue Ecoscaping In specific I intend at least to take this path:
The first 3 virtues (10% {{FoodBE}} carried over after growth, 30% faster Outpost =&gt; City conversion, free [Colonists%20%28CivBE%29](Colonist)) ensure that we get a free Colonist fairly early. This has the advantage that we won't stifle growth by producing the Colonist, and we can produce other things we need instead.
Early in game there will be many dig sites, and I want to capitalize on them with the 30 {{ScienceBE}} pr. [Expedition%20%28CivBE%29](Expedition) from Field Research. 
Finally we go for those two Energy [Virtues%20%28CivBE%29](Virtues), +5 {{EnergyBE}} in capitol and +1 {{EnergyBE}} on basic resources, to fund future Terrascapes.
This concludes my strategy ideas for the upcoming civilization game, I hope you guys can use it, and maybe even post some suggestions or comments. ~~~~ 
“Lets play”-video..
I intend to post a play-through of my strategy here after the launch on Oct. 24th.
