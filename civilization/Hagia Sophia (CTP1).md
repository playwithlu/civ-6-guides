Great Library entry.
The Hagia Sophia of Istanbul is said to be of all religions. Constantine, the Roman Emperor and founder of the city, erected the original church on the site of a pagan temple in 325 AD. Not baptized until on his death bed, Constantine himself was pagan, which may explain the rather non-sectarian name, Hagia Sophia, meaning "Holy Wisdom." In 1453 conquering Turks converted the Hagia Sophia into a mosque. So it remained until 1935 when it was secularized and opened to people of all faiths as a museum.
