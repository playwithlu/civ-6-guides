# Capital (CivBE)

Your Capital is the [City%20%28CivBE%29](city) that contains your [Headquarters%20%28CivBE%29](Headquarters), the center of your [Colony%20%28CivBE%29](colony) and the symbol of your [List%20of%20sponsors%20in%20CivBE](sponsor's) influence. The first city you found will automatically become your Capital at the beginning of the game, and is also considered your "original capital" for the purposes of a [Victory%20%28CivBE%29%23Domination](Domination Victory).
If your Capital is captured, the Headquarters (as well as the Capital status) will move to your next largest city.
Only players in control of their original capitals are eligible for a Domination Victory.
