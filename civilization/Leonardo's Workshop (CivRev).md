# Leonardo's Workshop (CivRev)

Leonardo's Workshop is a [Wonder%20%28CivRev%29](wonder) in "[Civilization%20Revolution](Civilization Revolution)".
Leonardo's Workshop can be built when the player discovers [Invention%20%28CivRev%29](Invention). When completed, it upgrades all the player's units to the most advanced level they have discovered. For example, if the player has discovered the [Gunpowder%20%28CivRev%29](Gunpowder) [List%20of%20technologies%20in%20CivRev](technology) and builds this wonder, all of his or her [Archer%20%28CivRev%29](Archers) and [Pikemen%20%28CivRev%29](Pikemen) will become [Riflemen%20%28CivRev%29](Riflemen). [Horsemen%20%28CivRev%29](Horsemen), [Knight%20%28CivRev%29](Knights), and some upgraded [Warrior%20%28CivRev%29](Warriors) and [Legion%20%28CivRev%29](Legions) (if they have [March%20%28CivRev%29](March), [Blitz%20%28CivRev%29](Blitz), or [Infiltration%20%28CivRev%29](Infiltration)) can become [Tank%20%28CivRev%29](Tanks). Archers, Warriors, Pikemen, and Riflemen can become [Modern%20Infantry%20%28CivRev%29](Modern Infantry). [Galley%20%28CivRev%29](Galleys), Triremes, and [Galleon%20%28CivRev%29](Galleons) can become [Cruiser%20%28CivRev%29](Cruisers), but not [Battleship%20%28CivRev%29](Battleships). Any embarked units will also upgrade (except the [Ranger%20Militia%20%28CivRev%29](Ranger Militia), which remain unchanged). [Catapult%20%28CivRev%29](Catapults), Trebuchets, and [Cannon%20%28CivRev%29](Cannons) can become [Artillery%20%28CivRev%29](Artillery) units. Air units and Submarines are not affected.
Any upgrades, such as [Veteran%20%28CivRev%29](veteran) status, Blitz, or [Loyalty%20%28CivRev%29](Loyalty), will remain. Any units in [City%20%28CivRev%29](cities) acquired later in the game by flipping will remain whatever they were and will not be upgraded.
It is best to build this wonder just after discovering [Mass%20production%20%28CivRev%29](Mass Production), [Combustion%20%28CivRev%29](Combustion), [Steam%20Power%20%28CivRev%29](Steam Power), and the [Automobile%20%28CivRev%29](Automobile) (though if the player has no or few Catapults and Cannons, the Automobile can be researched later).
Note that this wonder provides its benefit only once, so it cannot be cancelled and will not continue to upgrade units into more modern ones.
