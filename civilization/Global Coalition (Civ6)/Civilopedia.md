# Global Coalition (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Since the middle of the Twentieth Century, attitudes towards war between nations favor action by multiple nations agreeing to a common objective, rather than individual nations acting in their own interest. This system is assumed to represent a wider portion of the attitudes of people at large, and thus is more justified, should one believe that sovereignty rises directly from people. Successful global military coalitions have been formed by both the United Nations and by blocs of nations working in concert in a variety of armed conflicts. Junior partners in these coalitions may sometimes be induced to join a “coalition of the willing” through incentives through the senior partners in cases where the moral basis for the coalition is more ambiguous.
