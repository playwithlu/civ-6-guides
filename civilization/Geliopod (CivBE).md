# Geliopod (CivBE)

Game info.
The Geliopod is a Supremacy - Harmony hybrid melee unit sheathed in a variety of both technological and organic cloaking methods that allows them to wander through ally and enemy territory alike with impunity. Extremely effective at a commerce raiding, worker slaying, and improvement raiding role, these bio-mechs aren't quite as effective in direct combat against non-infantry targets. Hit-and-run is the key strategy to use with these submarines of the landscape.
Unit Upgrades.
Tier 1.
Early game Geliopods are a surprise to players who are already familiar with them - they are one of the only two stealth units on land, with the Nanohive which is additionally part of the same hybrid affinity. Their resource and Production cost are average but their Strength and Movement are quite respectable. They function as hunter-killer cavalry at this stage of the game, mainly because they do not have their powerful choice of perks yet.
Tier 2.
Tier 2 Geliopods are in their prime due to their perk choices. Aside from a Strength boost which is not as spectacular as other units, their generic and unique perk provides +70% Strength in surprise attacks, which allow it to reach very high damages for a fairly low resource-costing unit. Use them as hunter-killers at this stage - they are pretty unacceptable as a frontline.
