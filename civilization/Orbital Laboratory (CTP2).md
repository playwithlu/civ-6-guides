Gameplay.
Orbital Laboratories are large space stations that enable scientists to conduct experiments outside the confines of , atmospheres and ecologies. Scientists engage in cutting-edge experiments that would prove dangerous in conventional, earth-bound laboratories. For a city with an orbital lab, the boost to is measurable.
Great Library entry.
As the advancement of science in the 21st century continued to gain momentum, researchers began to bump up against the limitations of the world - atmospheric conditions, environmental regulations and the omnipresence of gravity. Seeking a research facility in which they could conduct experiments with no regard for these considerations, scientists looked to the stars. In 2037, a privately funded research group headed by the noted physicist Richard Myers launched the first operational orbital laboratory into space. The small research team aboard the craft was now able to conduct experiments in pursuit of breakthroughs in chaos theory and unified field theory. The laboratory was expensive to build and maintain. An advanced composite structure kept it lightweight and free from degradation. Fuel cells powered the huge reactors and battery of diagnostic equipment at the scientists' disposal. Soon, several cities began launching their own satellites and prompting a worldwide boost in scientific research.
