# Symphonies (Civ6)

Symphonies is a Wildcard [Policy%20Cards%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
Symphonies is the first and only policy that provides points toward earning [Great%20Musician%20%28Civ6%29](Great Musicians). The first ones don't start appearing until the [Industrial%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Industrial Era), and [Buildings%20%28Civ6%29](buildings) with slots for their Great Works of Music don't become available until the [Modern%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Modern Era), but the +4 bonus to points will help you attract all the Musicians you need to fill the empty slots in your [Broadcast%20Center%20%28Civ6%29](Broadcast Centers) and [Wonder%20%28Civ6%29](wonders) in short order.
