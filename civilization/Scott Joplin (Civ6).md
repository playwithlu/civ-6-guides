Strategy.
While [Great%20Writer%20%28Civ6%29](Great Writers) and [Great%20Musician%20%28Civ6%29](Great Musicians) normally don't have a lot of strategy around them, Scott Joplin is quite possibly the best in the game. Three [Great%20Work%20%28Civ6%29](Great Works of Music) instead of the usual two makes Joplin a much better investment. If going for a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Culture Victory), make an effort to get Joplin.
