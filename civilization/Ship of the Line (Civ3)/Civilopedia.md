# Ship of the Line (Civ3)/Civilopedia

The Napoleonic Era encompassed the "Age of Sail," a time when mighty Ships
of the Line tore into one another with rows upon rows of guns: ball shot,
grape shot, chain shot, a pull to stern and fire! Rake the enemy ship and
throw grappling hooks. And then the desperate hand-to-hand on the rocking,
creaking decks, as men armed with sabres and [pistolas] wavered back and forth
in a fight to the death.
