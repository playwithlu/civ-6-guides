# Musketeers (Civ1)

Musketeers supersede the [Phalanx%20%28Civ1%29](Phalanx) for defensive purposes.
Civilopedia entry.
The development of Gunpowder revolutionized warfare because Musketeers, relatively inexpensive to equip and train, proved a deadly foe to the Knight, the previous champion of the battlefield. The mounted warrior was forced to share the battlefield with Musketeers and Cannon, because now each arm had to complement the strengths and weaknesses of the others. Victory most often went to the general who could best orchestrate the deployment of all three. Large numbers of Musketeers within a fortress, or entrenched behind city walls, could prove an exceedingly difficult obstacle to an attacking army.
