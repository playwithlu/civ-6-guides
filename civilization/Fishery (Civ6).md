# Fishery (Civ6)

The Fishery is a [Governor%20%28Civ6%29](Governor) [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](tile improvement) in "". It can only be built in a [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) in which a [Liang%20%28Surveyor%29%20%28Civ6%29](Surveyor Governor) with [Aquaculture%20%28Civ6%29](Aquaculture) is established, and must be on a [Coast%20%28Civ6%29](Coast) or [Lake%20%28Civ6%29](Lake) [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tile).
Strategy.
The Fishery provides its city with , helping it grow rapidly. Build it around cities rich in water-based [Resource%20%28Civ6%29](resources) to make their Population skyrocket. As of the [Civilization%20VI%20September%202019%20Update](September 2019 Update), Fisheries provide a bonus to help with growth from the new food source.
The Fishery is unique in that it can be built on any Coast or Lake tile, not just on resources like [Fishing%20Boats%20%28Civ6%29](Fishing Boats), which makes it similar to the [Farm%20%28Civ6%29](Farm). Of course it will be more productive when placed next to resources, but even on normal tiles, and after its parent city constructs a [Harbor%20%28Civ6%29](Harbor) [District%20%28Civ6%29](district) and all its [Building%20%28Civ6%29](buildings), the Fishery will provide a great source of . Use it as a saving grace in cities built in arid areas ([Desert%20%28Civ6%29](Desert), [Tundra%20%28Civ6%29](Tundra), and [Snow%20%28Civ6%29](Snow)) where there is an inherent problem with production. Be aware, however, that Fisheries do not get a boost from [God%20of%20the%20Sea%20%28Civ6%29](God of the Sea), and they also negate the bonus that [Shipyard%20%28Civ6%29](Shipyards) grant to unimproved water tiles in "".
When possible, the [Indonesian%20%28Civ6%29](Indonesians) and the [Dutch%20%28Civ6%29](Dutch) should favor [Kampung%20%28Civ6%29](Kampungs) and [Polder%20%28Civ6%29](Polders) over Fisheries, as those improvements are generally more productive.
Note that the in-game description of the Fishery says that it provides +1 additional if adjacent to a sea resource; however, it actually provides +1 additional for "each" adjacent sea resource.
