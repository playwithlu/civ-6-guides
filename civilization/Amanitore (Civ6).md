# Amanitore (Civ6)

Amanitore (? – c. 20 CE), was a of the , who ruled alongside king . She is considered one of the last great Kushite builders, her reign overseeing of temples, pyramids and reservoirs throughout her kingdom. She leads the [Nubian%20%28Civ6%29](Nubians) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Nubia is the Land of the Bow, and their civ's archers are second to none. Amanitore led the historical Nubians on their greatest building spree; she does the same here with her fascination with [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) planning and {{District6}} construction.
In-Game.
Amanitore's unique [Agenda%20%28Civ6%29](agenda) is City Planner. She always tries to have the greatest possible number of districts in her cities and likes civilizations that do the same.
Amanitore's leader ability is Kandake of Meroë. It provides her cities with 20% bonus {{Production6}} toward districts, or 40% if they have [Nubian%20Pyramid%20%28Civ6%29](Nubian Pyramids) adjacent to their [City%20Center%20%28Civ6%29](City Centers).
Detailed Approach.
Nubia will want to scout aggressively for [Desert%20%28Civ6%29](desert) [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles) while rushing toward [Masonry%20%28Civ6%29](Masonry). With that technology in hand, they can place down their cities, always striving for a cluster of their pyramids in the center. Districts placed next to these pyramids will provide amplified yields, powering the civ's development. Finding mines is also a key priority: historically all the mineral riches enjoyed by Egypt came from Nubia and this civilization can get rich from minerals as well. And if they need to defend their cities, they have the world's best ranged units who should easily be up to the task.
