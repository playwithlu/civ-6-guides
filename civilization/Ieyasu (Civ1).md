Gameplay.
This leader is very expansionist and will go to great lengths to expand his borders but this leader is not Militaristic such as his [Mongol%20%28Civ1%29](Mongolian) counterpart [Genghis%20Khan%20%28Civ1%29](Genghis Khan). If you are playing on an [Earth%20%28map%29%20%28Civ1%29](Earth map) and the [Chinese%20%28Civ1%29](Chinese) or the Mongolians are also in the game, the Japanese will not be able to expand very much into [Asia](Asia).
Note that the Earth map is not static - for instance, sometimes there will be a land bridge to [Korea](Korea) and at other times there won't. If there is a land bridge to Asia then the Japanese will make building ships a low priority.
