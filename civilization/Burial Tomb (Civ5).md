# Burial Tomb (Civ5)

Game Info.
Unique building of the [Egyptian%20%28Civ5%29](Egyptian) [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilization). Requires [Shrine%20%28Civ5%29](Shrine). Replaces the [Temple%20%28Civ5%29](Temple).
Strategy.
Compared to the [Temple%20%28Civ5%29](Temple) it replaces, the Burial Tomb is much better, providing additional for the empire, and costing no maintenance. The downside is that an enemy will gain more when capturing this [City%20%28Civ5%29](city), so if you're convinced that your city is about to fall into enemy hands, be sure to sell the Burial Tomb.
In conjunction with the [Meritocracy%20%28Civ5%29](Meritocracy) [Social%20policies%20%28Civ5%29](social policy), expending the to build Burial Tombs makes founding new cities -neutral. This is a huge boon for Egyptian players who want to settle wide tracts of land.
