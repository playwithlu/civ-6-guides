# Market Economy (Civ6)

Market Economy is an Economic [Policy%20Cards%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
If your [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) has been focusing mainly on trade, Market Economy will help you catch up in the [Technologies%20%28Civ6%29](technological) and [Civics%20%28Civ6%29](civic) races. If your civilization has been focusing on a combination of trade and scientific or cultural development, Market Economy will help you remain at or near the forefront of the race in the final [Era%20%28Civ6%29](eras) of the game. Either way, if you have a lot of {{TradeRoute6}}s running, you'll want to adopt this policy as soon as it's available and make sure it stays in one of your [Government%20%28Civ6%29](government's) {{EconomicPolicy6}} Economic slots.
