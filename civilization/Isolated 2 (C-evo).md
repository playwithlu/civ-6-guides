# Isolated 2 (C-evo)

Introduction.
"Isolated 2" is one of the [predesigned%20maps%20%28C-evo%29](predesigned maps) available from [C-evo](C-evo)'s "Configurator".
The human player starts on a somewhat unproductive corner of a moderate-sized island and can reach several smaller islands with [Longboats%20%28C-evo%29](Longboats) but needs [Navigation%20%28C-evo%29](Navigation) to reach other nations. The other 14 nations start on a single huge much-dissected continent that contains 21 potential starting positions, so that there are hundreds of possible combinations.
The vital rare minerals are widely distributed.
Play at "hard" level.
After a very slow start, a player on the "Hard" [difficulty%20level%20%28C-evo%29](difficulty level) can win against the [Standard%20AI](Standard AI) with a bit of luck and lots of good management. Technology boosts from other nations will probably be essential, but there is no certainty that your friends will long survive invasions by less [advance%20%28C-evo%29](advance)d but bigger enemies. Blockades with [air%20unit%20%28C-evo%29](air unit)s are likely to be the only way to avoid early defeat by invaders.
Screenshots.
Screenshot from advanced stage of successful game. See a hint of slow start - human's first new city appeared as late as 850 BC (and on a second try, attempting to start a city earlier but on a different site, exactly the same year was the result!)
