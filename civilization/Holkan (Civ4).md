# Holkan (Civ4)

The Holkan is the [Unique%20unit%20%28Civ4%29](unique unit) of the [Mayan%20%28Civ4%29](Mayan) [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ4](civilization).
Strategy.
Compared to the [Spearman%20%28Civ4%29](Spearmen) they replace, Holkan have the following differences:
Holkan do very well at repelling an early attack. Since they can be built quickly and do not rely on a [Resource%20%28Civ4%29](resource), you can have them up and running ready for a horse-based attack - particularly useful if you're against an opponent with an early-[Era%20%28Civ4%29](era) unique [List%20of%20mounted%20units%20in%20Civ4](mounted unit).
Like all early no-resource units, Holkan can run early attacks, but it's highly likely that your opponents will already have [Archer%20%28Civ4%29](Archers) and possibly [Axeman%20%28Civ4%29](Axemen), making it a more difficult route than most.
