# Construction (Civ4)

Strategy.
Construction allows you to build the [Catapult%20%28Civ4%29](Catapult) unit and the [War%20Elephant%20%28Civ4%29](War Elephant) (with [Ivory%20%28Civ4%29](Ivory)). It also enables [Colosseum%20%28Civ4%29](Colosseums) and your units no longer lose movement when crossing rivers on roads.
