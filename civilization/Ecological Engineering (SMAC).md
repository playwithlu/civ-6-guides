# Ecological Engineering (SMAC)

Lifeforms have always shown remarkable skill at innovation and ingenuity in the face of environmental hurdles. Expansion on a new Planet highlights these traits once again in the form of Ecological Engineering. Based on the discoveries of [Centauri%20Ecology%20%28SMAC%29](Centauri Ecology) and [Gene%20Splicing%20%28SMAC%29](Gene Splicing), this research leads to new ways of thriving within the existing ecosystem, rather than competing with it.
