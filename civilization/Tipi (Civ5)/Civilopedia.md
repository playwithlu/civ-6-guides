# Tipi (Civ5)/Civilopedia

A tipi (or teepee) is a portable, conical tent constructed of tanned hides and wooden poles traditionally associated with the migratory North American Plains Indians. The word itself comes from the Lakota for "they dwell." Often elaborately painted, tipis not only sheltered the Shoshone but served to identify the separate tribes.
