He leads the [Arabian%20%28Civ6%29](Arabs) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Defeating opponents with either military or [Religion%20%28Civ6%29](Religion) is at the heart of playing with Sultan Saladin.
This is one of Saladin's two alternate [Persona%20%28Civ6%29](personas), the other being [Saladin%20%28Civ6%29](Vizier Saladin).
Intro.
 The marriage of science and religion is a delicate balancing act, but one that you have mastered, Saladin. Your quest for knowledge is noble, and your people have a deep respect for you. But you need not rush into the unknown. Given time, the answers to life's most puzzling questions will find their way back to Arabia.
In-Game.
Saladin's unique [Agenda%20%28Civ6%29](agenda) is Sultan of Egypt and Syria. He likes [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) who have founded a religion but not brought it to one of his [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities), and dislikes those that bring their religion to his cities.
His [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader ability) is The Victorious. It doubles [Flanking%20and%20Support%20%28Civ6%29](Flanking and Support) bonuses for all his [Military%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](military) and [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Religious](religious units).
Detailed Approach.
Being guaranteed a [Great%20Prophet%20%28Civ6%29](Great Prophet) allows Sultan Saladin a chance to build up his military until his free Great Prophet arrives. After the Great Prophet is received, go forth spreading Arabia’s Religion and military across the [Map%20%28Civ6%29](map). The [Mamluk%20%28Civ6%29](Mamluk) will be an asset in conquering faraway civilizations with its ability to heal every turn. The [Madrasa%20%28Civ6%29](Madrasa) will help you unlock stronger military units while also allowing the purchase of more [Apostle%20%28Civ6%29](Apostles). Arabia under the Sultan Saladin’s leadership is great for either [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Domination](Domination) or [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Religion](Religious Victories).
