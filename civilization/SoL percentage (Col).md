# SoL percentage (Col)

The or "Sons of Liberty membership" in a [colony](colony) in any of [Sid%20Meier%27s%20Colonization](Sid Meier's Colonization) is the percentage of the [Colony%20%28Col%29](colony's) population who support the idea of rebelling from the mother country. The remainder of the population are called Tories.
The percentage is based on the total number of [liberty%20bell](liberty bell)s the colony has produced. 
When it reaches 50%, productivity increases; at 100% it increases further. It can be really more than 100% (and therefore allowing some reduction while staying at effectively 100%) but shows no more than 100%.
If a colony has 10 (at the easiest difficulty; 6 at the hardest difficulty) or more colonists that are still Tories, it has "inefficient government" and will receive a -1 production penalty on everything produced there: [food%20%28Col%29](food), [goods](goods), [liberty%20bell](liberty bell)s, and [crosses%20%28Col%29](crosses). This has the effect of requiring you to increase your SoL percentage if you wish to have large, productive colonies.
In order to declare [Independence](Independence), the total SoL of all your colonies must be 50% or greater.
