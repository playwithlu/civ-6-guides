# Fishery (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Cultures that rely upon fishing to thrive must eventually grapple with the threat of overfishing. The more fish pulled from the sea, the less there are to create more fish.
One tried and tested solution is the humble fishery, which rears its stock in confinement to produce a somewhat predictable amount of fish. Cultures have practiced this “sustainable aquafarming” for millennia, from ancient China’s carp fisheries to modern coastal salmon pens. Such practices work out well for all involved—except, of course, the fish.
