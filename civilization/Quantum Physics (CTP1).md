# Quantum Physics (CTP1)

Quantum Physics is an advance in "".
Summary.
Quantum Physics, the fifth Physical Science Advance, complicates the clock-like universe of Newton by introducing theories of general relativity and Quantum Physics. Quantum Physics also upsets notions of determinacy, proving that much can never be known. It offers the Nuclear Plant which greatly increases a city's production, as well as the Nuke, one of the most devastating weapons ever developed.

The Manhattan Project proved that Einstein was correct in predicting that matter was a solid form of energy. With the power unleashed by fission, mankind developed first the atomic bomb, then the hydrogen bomb, and finally the fission reactor. While the first two only destroyed, the third provided condensed energy at a price. However, fission waste proved difficult to process or to store. By the end of the 20th century, the United States still had no solution for the long-term disposal of fission waste.
