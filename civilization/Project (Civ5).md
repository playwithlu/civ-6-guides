# Project (Civ5)

In "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)" and its expansions, a project can be undertaken in a [City%20%28Civ5%29](city) to provide some sort of benefit.
There are two types of projects in the game: National Projects and [International%20Project%20%28Civ5%29](International Projects). National Projects must be undertaken separately by each [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilization) and provide their benefits only to those who complete them. International Projects, which are introduced in "", may be undertaken by multiple civs at once and provide benefits to the three biggest contributors.
