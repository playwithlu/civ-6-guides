# Lautaro (Civ6)

Leftraru (c. 1534 – 29 April 1557), better known as Lautaro, was a young Mapuche , known for escaping captivity under Spanish governor and afterwards turning his captors' tactics against them while leading the resistance against the . He leads the [Mapuche%20%28Civ6%29](Mapuche) in "".
The Mapuche maintain a strong [Loyalty%20%28Civ6%29](Loyalty) within their people, and can be a formidable foe on the battlefield, both offensively and defensively.
Intro.
 You did not liberate the Mapuche, young Lautaro—you inspired them to free themselves. Build totems to honor your ancestors and embolden their descendants. Such pride will fill the hearts of your cavalry as they redouble their raids into enemy lands. Stand with the Mapuche, axe-bearer, and cast a singular shadow.
In-Game.
Lautaro's unique [Agenda%20%28Civ6%29](agenda) is Spirit of Tucapel. He tries to keep his [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities') Loyalty high, dislikes civilizations that lose cities due to low Loyalty and likes civilizations that earn cities through Loyalty pressure.
His [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader ability) is Swift Hawk. Mapuche [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](units) gain +10 Combat Strength when fighting civilizations in [Age%20%28Civ6%29](Golden or Heroic Ages), as well as when fighting [Loyalty%20%28Civ6%29%23Free%20Cities](Free Cities). Defeating a unit within the [Borders%20%28Civ6%29](borders) of an enemy city causes that city to lose 20 Loyalty, or 40 Loyalty if that city belongs to a civilization in a Golden or Heroic Age.
Detailed Approach.
The Mapuche will want to acquire a [Governor%20%28Civ6%29](Governor) early, using them both to strengthen Loyalty in their cities as well as granting their [Military%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](combat units) the ability to gain [Experience%20%28Civ6%29](experience) faster on the battlefield. When at war, the Mapuche need not fear an opponent benefitting from a [Golden%20Age%20%28Civ6%29](Golden Age). When going on the offense, fight within your opponent's borders to weaken the Loyalty in their cities. Use this to your advantage to create unrest to slow their production or cause them to lose cities that are already disloyal. The Mapuche [Mal%C3%B3n%20Raider%20%28Civ6%29](Malón Raider) is a powerful assault unit, but don't neglect training them even with a defensive strategy, as they are excellent at defending their borders from attack. A late game [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Culture victory) is also a possibility for the Mapuche with strategic placement of their [Chemamull%20%28Civ6%29](Chemamull) [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](improvement).
