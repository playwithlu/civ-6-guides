# Valentine Tank (CTP2)

The Valentine Tank is the British civilization's counterpart the French Civilization's [R-35%20tank%20%28CTP2%29](R-35). With light armour and a decent speed, it is the polar opposite to the Churchill tank, sacrificing armour for speed. Oddly, the Valentine in-game bears a larger resemblance to the Matilda II Infantry tank, which was developed prior to the Valentine.
