Civilopedia entry.
In the colder regions of the world, where winter months tend to leave the ground snow covered, skiing often became one of the most reliable means of transportation. In the alpine countries of Europe, it became commonplace to train special groups of soldiers to take advantage of the snow covered, mountainous terrain by traveling on skis. This proved to be a huge advantage, especially if the enemy forces were not likewise equipped. In November 1939, for example during the Russo-Finnish War, the Finns managed to cut off the supply and communications lines of the vastly superior Russian army through the use of their extremely mobile ski troops, and the Finns continued to hold an advantage throughout the winter months. Alpine troops continue to be trained and utilized in military forces of the present day.
