# Lumber Mill (Civ6)

The Lumber Mill is a standard [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](tile improvement) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It can be built only on [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles) with [Woods%20%28Civ6%29](Woods).
In the "" expansion, the Lumber Mill is unlocked with [Construction%20%28Civ6%29](Construction) and can be built on tiles with [Rainforest%20%28Civ6%29](Rainforests) after researching [Mercantilism%20%28Civ6%29](Mercantilism).
Strategy.
Any Woods feature along a [River%20%28Civ6%29](River) (especially if on [Hills%20%28Civ6%29](Hills)) can become invaluable for industry due to the high {{Production6}} boost from Lumber Mills. Avoid cutting down Woods in the early game, because being able to improve them with Lumber Mills will provide you with a great boost to {{Production6}}. What's more, later you will be able to claim diplomatic bonuses for not having cut these Woods, in addition to gaining [Appeal%20%28Civ6%29](Appeal) bonuses for neighboring tiles!
In "Gathering Storm", after the [Civilization%20VI%20June%202019%20Update](June 2019 Update), the Lumber Mill has been redesigned and enhanced considerably: it is unlocked one [Eras%20%28Civ6%29](era) earlier and has +2 {{Production6}} from the start (which replaces the River [Adjacency%20bonus%20%28Civ6%29](adjacency bonus)). This makes it a vital {{Production6}} booster for empires starting in level [Terrain%20%28Civ6%29](terrain) without Hills, where Woods are the only useful feature. Furthermore, come the [Renaissance%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Renaissance Era) and the discovery of Mercantilism, the Lumber Mill can now be built on Rainforest tiles as well! All this makes the Lumber Mill a viable alternative to the [Mine%20%28Civ6%29](Mine) as a general {{Production6}} booster for areas where Woods and Rainforests dominate. It also has the advantage of not requiring the Woods or Rainforest to be cleared from its tile as a Mine does (unless the tile also contains a [Resources%20%28Civ6%29](resource)), which has more implications than just the diminished Appeal in "Gathering Storm".
