# Tomyris (Civ6)

Tomyris (? – c. 520s BCE) was a warrior-queen who reigned over the , a Scythian pastoral-nomadic confederation in Central Asia. She is known for leading her people against an invasion by [Cyrus%20%28Civ6%29](Cyrus the Great)'s , allegedly defeating and killing him in 530 BC. She leads the [Scythian%20%28Civ6%29](Scythians) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Tomyris' Scythia is going to be a threat to strike quickly and decisively at any time, especially during the Ancient and Classical periods. Luckily she has a strict code of honor and will never backstab anyone; she'll only be attacking those who deserve it for mistreating others.
Intro.
 All people will tremble with fear and respect for you, great warrior Queen Tomyris. For it is from the back of your stallion that you shall look upon and lead the Scythian people. Great epics will be told of the horse warriors that ride forth from the steppe, and at the front line of every battle - they will find you. Ride on, fierce queen, and may your friends be true just as your enemies falter.
In-Game.
Tomyris' unique [Agenda%20%28Civ6%29](agenda) is Backstab Averse. She likes those willing to become her Declared Friends, but hates those who declare Surprise Wars on other civilizations, especially if declared against former friends or allies.
Her [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader ability) is Killer of Cyrus. All her [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](units) receive +5 Combat Strength when attacking wounded units, and heal up to 30 [hit%20points](hit points) (as of the [Civilization%20VI%20Summer%202017%20Update](Summer 2017 Update)) when they eliminate a unit.
Detailed Approach.
The Scythians are the masters of the open [Grassland%20%28Civ6%29](Grasslands) and [Plains%20%28Civ6%29](Plains). They are a purely military civilization who wants to settle near [Horses%20%28Civ6%29](Horses) and other [Pasture%20%28Civ6%29](Pasture)-based resources. These locations will let them build plenty of mounted units and find desirable places to plant their [Kurgan%20%28Civ6%29](Kurgans), a key component to them getting a [Religion%20%28Civ6%29](Religion) started (hopefully one where they can worship the [God%20of%20the%20Open%20Sky%20%28Civ6%29](God of the Open Sky) [Pantheons%20%28Civ6%29](Pantheon)). Be very cautious if Tomyris is on the [Continent%20%28Civ6%29](continent) with you - a Surprise War against another civilization means you'll have her at your throat quickly. It'd be much like declaring war on two civilizations at once.
