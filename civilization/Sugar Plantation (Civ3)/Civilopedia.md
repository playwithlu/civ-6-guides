# Sugar Plantation (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Planting of sugar cane began in southeast Asia and was brought to Europe by Arab conquerors
during the Middle Ages. On his second voyage to the Caribbean, Columbus introduced the plant
to the region, and found that it grew better here in the tropical climate of the Caribbean
than anywhere else. Sugar plantations sprung up throughout the islands, fueling trans-Atlantic
trade in both cane sugar and the alcoholic beverage derived from sugar -- rum.
