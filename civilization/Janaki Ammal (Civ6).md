Unique ability.
Gain 400 for each here or adjacent.
Strategy.
If you have access to a wide swath of Rainforest, Janaki Ammal is a terrific , offering up to 2800 , which is enough to unlock up to two free technologies from the Atomic Era.
However, other Great Scientists from this era may be better, depending on the circumstances. For example, [Erwin%20Schr%C3%B6dinger%20%28Civ6%29](Erwin Schrödinger), another Atomic Era , provides three [Boost%20%28Civ6%29](Eurekas) from the Atomic or [Information%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Information Era). The least expensive technologies from the Atomic Era cost 1065 , so Schrödinger provides at least 1278 . Comparatively, Ammal can provide more than twice that, but only under specific circumstances. Therefore, she has great synergy with civilizations with incentives to settle in or near Rainforest, such as [Vietnamese%20%28Civ6%29](Vietnam), [Brazilian%20%28Civ6%29](Brazil), and the [Kongolese%20%28Civ6%29](Kongo). If you do not have a good location where Ammal can earn you at least 1200-1600 , don't bother.
