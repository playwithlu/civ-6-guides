# Mandala State (Civ6)

Mandala State is a [Golden%20Age%20%28Civ6%29](Golden Age) [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) from the [Dramatic%20Ages%20%28Civ6%29](Dramatic Ages) [Game%20Mode%20%28Civ6%29](Game Mode) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is available from the [Classical%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Classical Era) to the [Medieval%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Medieval Era) and uses a {{WildcardSlotIcon6}} Wildcard slot.
Strategy.
Unfortunately, Mandala State arrives too early to be combined with the [Voidsingers%20%28Civ6%29](Voidsingers') [Cultist%20%28Civ6%29](Cultist) and assist with taking over [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) through [Loyalty%20%28Civ6%29](Loyalty) pressure. However, with enough [Wonder%20%28Civ6%29](wonders), combined with enough [Great%20Work%20%28Civ6%29](Great Works) as [Eleanor%20of%20Aquitaine%20%28Civ6%29](Eleanor of Aquitaine), for example, you can still use this card to effectively flip cities to your empire with Loyalty pressure if you have even halfway-decent {{CitizenIcon6}} Population in your cities. It is especially useful for this purpose if you have multiple wonders (such as those that you've recently acquired through conquest) and/or have multiple neighbors in [Dark%20Age%20%28Civ6%29](Dark Ages).
