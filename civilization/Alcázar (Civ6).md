Occupying unit receives +4 {{Strength6}} Defense Strength and 2 turns of fortification
The Alcázar is a special [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](tile improvement) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It can be built by a player that is the {{Link6|Suzerain}} of the {{Link6|Granada}} {{Link6|city-state}}.
In the [Zombie%20Defense%20%28Civ6%29](Zombie Defense) [Game%20mode%20%28Civ6%29](game mode), the Alcázar deals moderate (15 [HP](HP)) damage to hostile units passing through it.
Strategy.
The Alcázar is an improved [Fort%20%28Civ6%29](Fort), providing {{Culture6}} in addition to its defensive bonuses. Non-aggressive players aiming for a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Culture Victory) will find it particularly useful after researching [Flight%20%28Civ6%29](Flight), as it will provide them with extra {{Tourism6}} while making their lands easier to defend. Furthermore, with its bonus yield to {{Science6}} in "", players have an incentive to build the [Eiffel%20Tower%20%28Civ6%29](Eiffel Tower) for more useful Alcázars.
Certain [Terrain%20%28Civ6%29%23Features](terrain features), such as {{Link6|Woods}} or {{Link6|Rainforest}}, will have to be removed before the Alcázar can be built. Also note that an Alcázar may not be constructed on top of [Resource%20%28Civ6%29](resources).
