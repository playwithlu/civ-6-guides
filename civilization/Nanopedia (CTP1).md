Great Library entry.
Combining nanotech, wetware, and distributed personality, the Nanopedia was developed as an educational system designed to educate children. Inexpensive to manufacture and in the form of a simple book, the Nanopedia (consisting of billions of living hive-like nanites) had auditory as well as holographic capabilities and was 100% dynamic - able to respond to any request. The Nanopedia revolutionized education by making a history of knowledge available to children in a single book.
