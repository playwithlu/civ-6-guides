# Praetorian Guard (Civ6)

Praetorian Guard is a [Golden%20Age%20%28Civ6%29](Golden Age) [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) from the [Dramatic%20Ages%20%28Civ6%29](Dramatic Ages) [Game%20mode%20%28Civ6%29](game mode) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is available from the [Classical%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Classical Era) to the [Renaissance%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Renaissance Era) and uses a Wildcard slot.
Strategy.
Despite the rather misleading description, Praetorian Guard does not turn all of your wounded [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](units) into [Mamluk%20%28Civ6%29](Mamluks), as they will not heal 10 [HP](HP) at the end of every turn regardless of their actions that turn - rather, it allows your units to heal 10 extra HP when they "Fortify and Heal." It works in a similar fashion to the [Medic%20%28Civ6%29](Medic) or units affected by the activated [Abu%20Al-Qasim%20Al-Zahrawi%20%28Civ6%29](Abu Al-Qasim Al-Zahrawi). It's most useful for [Vampire%20%28Civ6%29](Vampires) (in the [Secret%20Societies%20%28Civ6%29](Secret Societies) game mode), for [Naval%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](naval units) (which will be able to heal anywhere, as though they had the [Supply%20Fleet%20%28Civ6%29](Supply Fleet) ), or when your units are in hostile [Territory%20%28Civ6%29](territory), as they can now heal 15 HP per turn instead of 5.
