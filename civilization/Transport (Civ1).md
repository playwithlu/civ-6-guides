The Transport can carry up to eight other units. It does not cause unhappiness when it is away from its home city.
Civilopedia entry.
The troop Transport, which in peacetime serves as a cargo or passenger ship, is the principal means used by modern powers to move large quantities of equipment and military units from one place to another. Always requiring protection, the Transport, when properly employed, can quickly move substantial forces to either threaten enemy-held territory, or to reinforce friendly troops or cities located overseas.
