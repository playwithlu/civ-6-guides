# Masaru Ibuka (Civ6)

Masaru Ibuka is an {{Link6|Information Era}} [Great%20Merchant%20%28Civ6%29](Great Merchant) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
Even for players who aim for a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Cultural Victory), Masaru Ibuka is a very lackluster {{GreatPerson6}} because he arrives too late to have much of an influence compared to {{Tourism6}} sources like [National%20Park%20%28Civ6%29](National Parks) and [Rock%20Band%20%28Civ6%29](Rock Bands). Moreover, a player aiming for a Cultural Victory is disincentivized from building Industrial Zones because of the [Appeal%20%28Civ6%29](Appeal) penalties and [Great%20Engineer%20%28Civ6%29](Great Engineers) generally being less useful for this type of [Victory%20%28Civ6%29](victory) (excepting the ones who provide {{Production6}} toward [Wonder%20%28Civ6%29](wonder) construction).
