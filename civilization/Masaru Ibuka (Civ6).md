Strategy.
Even for players who aim for a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Cultural Victory), Masaru Ibuka is a very lackluster because he arrives too late to have much of an influence compared to sources like [National%20Park%20%28Civ6%29](National Parks) and [Rock%20Band%20%28Civ6%29](Rock Bands). Moreover, a player aiming for a Cultural Victory is disincentivized from building Industrial Zones because of the [Appeal%20%28Civ6%29](Appeal) penalties and [Great%20Engineer%20%28Civ6%29](Great Engineers) generally being less useful for this type of [Victory%20%28Civ6%29](victory) (excepting the ones who provide toward [Wonder%20%28Civ6%29](wonder) construction).
