# Cyber Warfare (Civ6)/Civilopedia

The highly interconnected weapons systems of the information age rely on a mix of military and commercial components, processes, and software, creating what is essentially a new logistics reality for military professionals. Although interconnected weapons systems provide enhanced firepower and effectiveness (as anyone whoâ€™s witnessed highlight reels of smart bombs striking can attest), they do create a potential weakness. An opponent can attack the computer infrastructure of a modern military, often achieving better results than if they had tried to attack that same force directly. "Cyber Warfare" can roughly be defined as a formal attempt to degrade, destroy, or weaken the communications and computer infrastructure of a modern military. Some military theoreticians also use this term to refer to operations against civilian targets, like power grids.
