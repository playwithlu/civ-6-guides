# Trapping (Civ5)

Game Info.
Some animals cannot be domesticated and grown in human-controlled environments - they need to be hunted in their natural habitats. The Trapping technology allows your [Worker%20%28Civ5%29](Workers) to build [Camp%20%28Civ5%29](Camps) for hunting on resources such as [Deer%20%28Civ5%29](Deer) and [Ivory%20%28Civ5%29](Ivory). Also allows the construction of the first {{HappinessIcon5}} Happiness-producing building, the [Circus%20%28Civ5%29](Circus), in cities which have access to [Horses%20%28Civ5%29](Horses) or [Ivory%20%28Civ5%29](Ivory).
