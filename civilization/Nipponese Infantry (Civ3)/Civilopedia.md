# Nipponese Infantry (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Nipponese infantry of WWII were a rude (and deadly) surprise to the soldiers of the "western" nations that
encountered them. The typical Japanese soldier was adept in jungle warfare and well-trained at night fighting.
He even preferred to attack during a rainstorm. Although the firepower of his 7.7mm bolt-action rifle could not
outdo the quick-firing M1 Garand of the American GI, it was more than made up for by
his quick wit and skill in jungle terrain. Finally, each Nipponese soldier operated under the Code of Bushido,
which taught that to be captured by the enemy was a disgrace, but to die in combat for the Emperor was the
highest possible honor, thus making him ever-ready to execute a suicidal "Banzai" charge against overwhelming
Allied firepower.
