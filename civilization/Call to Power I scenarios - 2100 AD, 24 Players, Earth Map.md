Introduction.
The game begins in 2102 AD and each turn is 2 years, so in 50 turns it's 2200 AD.

So this means that in the period from 2100 AD to when ever the game end will still have a politically divided world.Â The game ends in 3000 AD, but can last to 4000 AD if this time extender mod is used.
Players.
There are 24 players and each player represents his or her future version in the 22nd century, so [Roman%20%28CTP1%29](Romans) represent Italians, and [Assyrian%20%28CTP1%29](Assyrians) represent Iraqis, etc. For some reason the maker of this decided to not put in Regional Supra-national states or allied powers. So this means that the [American%20%28CTP1%29](Americans) don't get to have the cities in Canada, Japan, Israel or Mexico. The made for play is Civilization is American however so this means that as Player 1 your goal could be to conquer these other civilizations, although it's not required to win the game militarily.
