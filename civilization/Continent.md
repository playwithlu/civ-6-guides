# Continent

In the "[Civilization%20%28series%29](Civilization)" games, a continent is a group of contiguous land [tile](tile)s that form a landmass. In some games, each island is considered to be its own continent; in others, a continent may include multiple islands and larger landmasses (or parts of larger landmasses).
