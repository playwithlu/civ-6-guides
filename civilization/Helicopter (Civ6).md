# Helicopter (Civ6)

The Helicopter is an [Atomic%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Atomic Era) [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Light%20cavalry](light cavalry unit). It upgrades from the [Cavalry%20%28Civ6%29](Cavalry) (or its replacements).
In the "" expansion, the Helicopter requires 1 {{Aluminum6}} to train and 1 {{Aluminum6}} per turn to maintain.
Strategy.
In spite of having slightly lower {{Moves6}} than the units from which it upgrades, the Helicopter can move over almost any type of terrain at minimal cost, giving it unrivaled maneuverability. And, despite being only slightly more powerful than the [Tank%20%28Civ6%29](Tank) and less powerful than the later [Modern%20Armor%20%28Civ6%29](Modern Armor), the Helicopter doesn't require [Resource%20%28Civ6%29](resources) to build (prior to "Gathering Storm").
Helicopters are best used to weaken attackers with hit-and-run tactics, or slip behind enemy lines and disrupt their infrastructure by [Combat%20%28Civ6%29%23Pillaging](pillaging) their {{District6}}s and [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](tile improvements). Be sure to keep them away from [Modern%20AT%20%28Civ6%29](Modern ATs), which can easily take down Helicopters with their anti-armor weaponry.
Despite technically being able to fly, the Helicopter is considered a land unit rather than an [Air%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](air unit), which means it can use [Roads%20%28Civ6%29](Roads) and [Railroad%20%28Civ6%29](Railroads) to enhance its mobility and is not vulnerable to anti-air weapons. It also cannot be launched from [Aircraft%20Carrier%20%28Civ6%29](Aircraft Carriers), but this hardly matters, given that it can [Movement%20%28Civ6%29%23Embarking](embark) and cross [Ocean%20%28Civ6%29](Ocean) [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles) freely. Ironically, on [Map%20%28Civ6%29](maps) where oceans dominate, the Helicopter can often cross long distances faster when embarked.
