# Space Tourism (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Once the technology exists to get things off Earth and into space, the question of how to get something into space tends to reduce to a matter of economics. In market-based economies, this means that inevitably someone will be willing to part with enough money to go into space. In a real sense, space tourism becomes inevitable after a while.
At the start of the Twenty-First Century, space tourism is only available to the ultra-wealthy, but there are concerted efforts to bring down the price and make it available to a wider market. Private companies are creating plans to bring more and more people into space, with the hopes that this will create more enthusiasm for space exploration, a better understanding of how fragile our planet remains, and (not least) quite a lot of money for the tour company.
