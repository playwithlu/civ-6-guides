# Louvre (Civ5)/Civilopedia

The Louvre is a large and incredibly ornate palace in Paris, France. Originally constructed in the 15th century on the site of an even older castle, for the next two and a half centuries the Louvre served as the home to many of France's kings, most of whom added to the already-huge structure. During the 17th century Kings Louis XIII and Louis XIV and their advisors Cardinals Richelieu and Mazarin began acquiring an extensive art collection which was kept at the Louvre. In 1682 the Royal court moved to Versailles, and in 1783 the Revolutionary government opened the palace to the public. It has remained a public museum ever since. Not surprisingly, it is considered to have the finest collection of pre-modern French paintings in the world.
