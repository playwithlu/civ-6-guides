Waste has always been a problem in human societies, but the population growth of the 20th century compounded this problem enormously.

Citizens were paid to recycle products such as glass, plastic, or aluminum, and municipalities opened Recycling Plants to sort out any recyclable materials thrown away by their citizens.
