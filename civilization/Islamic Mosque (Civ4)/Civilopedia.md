In common usage, the term "mosque" is used to describe any Islamic house of worship. In this game that term is reserved for the more important and impressive structures; common mosques are called "Islamic temples." The first mosque built was the "Kaaba," in Mecca, which resides inside of the Masjid al-Haram. According to tradition, the Kaaba was originally a temple constructed by the prophet Abraham and his son, Ishmael. By the Prophet Muhammad's time, the Kaaba was being used to worship many "false" gods; he destroyed the idols and rededicated the structure to Allah when he captured Mecca in 630 AD.
