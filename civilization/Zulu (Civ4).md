# Zulu (Civ4)

The Zulu people represent a [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ4](civilization) in "[Civilization%20IV](Civilization IV)".
Strategy.
The Zulus are best at achieving either a [Victory%20%28Civ4%29%23Conquest](Conquest) or [Victory%20%28Civ4%29%23Domination](Domination Victory) thanks to the strong synergy of [Shaka%20%28Civ4%29](Shaka's) [Aggressive%20%28Civ4%29](Aggressive) [Leader%20trait%20%28Civ4%29](trait) with their [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ4%23Replacements](unique unit) and [List%20of%20buildings%20in%20Civ4%23Unique%20buildings](unique building). The [Ikhanda%20%28Civ4%29](Ikhanda) reduces [City%20%28Civ4%29](city) [Maintenance%20%28Civ4%29](maintenance) costs by 20%, giving the player a good incentive to build one in each city they found or capture as soon as possible. Each [Military%20unit%20%28Civ4%29](military unit) trained in the city will then be ready for a [Promotion%20%28Civ4%29](promotion) immediately, on top of the free [Combat%20%28promotion%29%20%28Civ4%29](Combat I) promotion from Shaka. The [Impi%20%28Civ4%29](Impi) also starts with [Mobility%20%28Civ4%29](Mobility), allowing it to reach and capture cities quickly when trained en masse. The Ikhanda's reduction in city maintenance costs makes it cheaper to maintain a wide empire, alleviating some of the Zulus' economic concerns as they capture new cities and potentially making them strong candidates for a Domination Victory later in the game.
Since Impis require either [Copper%20%28Civ4%29](Copper) or [Iron%20%28Civ4%29](Iron), the first three [List%20of%20technologies%20in%20Civ4](technologies) the player researches should be [Mining%20%28Civ4%29](Mining), [Bronze%20Working%20%28Civ4%29](Bronze Working), and [Iron%20Working%20%28Civ4%29](Iron Working). This will reveal both of the required [Resource%20%28Civ4%29](resources), which can then be improved in order to get the Zulu war machine rolling.
