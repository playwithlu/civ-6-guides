Unit Upgrades.
Tier 1.
Early game Architects have no perks at their disposal, but are still formidable ranged support units. They are available fairly early if the player knows how to tech efficiently, before Tier 3 Rangers. Their Ranged Strength is respectable, and they can still provide basic utility to nearby friendly or enemy units. They are great when paired with Immortals or Battlesuits early game to take out Alien Nests.

Tier 2.
Tier 2 Architects receive a very unique set of perks that apply specifically to its utility actions. The generic perk allows -20% Strength to be siphoned on the battlefield, or the utility can be morphed to heal or damage on contact. First Architects can also be more versatile by using more utility actions at a time. Their Ranged Strength is still respectable, so they are a fairly expensive but useful alternative to Rangers.
