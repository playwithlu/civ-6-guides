# Nilometer (Civ6)

The Nilometer is an early infrastructure [Building%20%28Civ6%29](building) from the [Gifts%20of%20the%20Nile%20%28Civ6%29](Gifts of the Nile) [List%20of%20scenarios%20in%20Civ6](scenario) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It can be built in the [City%20Center%20%28Civ6%29](City Center).
Strategy.
The Nilometer allows [Egyptian%20%28Civ6%29](Egypt) and [Nubian%20%28Civ6%29](Nubia) to build large, productive cities along the banks of the Nile River. The bonus is nice, and the extra and from nearby Floodplains make this [Terrain%20%28Civ6%29](terrain) much more desirable to a city with a Nilometer.
