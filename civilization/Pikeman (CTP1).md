Summary.
Bringing massed defense back to the battlefield, the Pikeman provides a cheap, yet highly effective defense from the [Knight%20%28CTP1%29](Knight).

For most of seven centuries the Knight dominated the battlefield of Europe. In 1476 at the Battle of Grandson, the infantryman returned to prominence. There, the Swiss Confederate army decisively defeated the Burgundian Knights. The Confederate Army used 600-man squares with each man wielding an eighteen-foot ash pole mounted with a four-foot steel spike. Following the Swiss victory, the pike became the mainstay of European armies for almost two hundred years.
