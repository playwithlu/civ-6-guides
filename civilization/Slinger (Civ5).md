# Slinger (Civ5)

Game Info.
[Unique%20unit%20%28Civ5%29](Unique) ranged unit of the [Incan%20%28Civ5%29](Incan) [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilization). Replaces the [Archer%20%28Civ5%29](Archer).
Strategy.
The Slinger, like the seafaring [Caravel%20%28Civ5%29](Caravel) of the later [Era%20%28Civ5%29](eras), has the ability to withdraw from most melee attacks. So, once per turn the Slinger can effectively avoid an enemy melee unit which tries to attack it. Note that a second attack attempt within the same turn will succeed.
This unit is great for harassing your foes. However, the Slinger is weaker against melee attacks than the Archer it replaces, meaning it can easily be defeated if the enemy pins it against obstructions or chases it with fast units. The other drawback of this unit is that it can't protect your civilian units from melee attackers, as the Slinger will withdraw from battle, allowing any civilian unit that was sharing its tile to fall into the attackers' hands.
