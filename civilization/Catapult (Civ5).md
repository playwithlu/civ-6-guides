# Catapult (Civ5)

Game Info.
First siege unit of the game.
Strategy.
The Catapult is the first siege weapon available, extremely useful when assaulting early enemy [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities). It fires large projectiles (usually stones) which shatter upon impact and lay waste to stationary defenses, although they're not that effective against smaller or moving targets.
Like all but the most advanced siege machines, the Catapult is slow to set up and fire, using 1 in the process. Also, it is extremely vulnerable to enemy melee attack and too bulky to use natural [Terrain%20%28Civ5%29](terrain) defenses, so it always should be supported by other [Unit%20%28Civ5%29](units) when it's in the field. Use it primarily for sieges, and never move it into range of an enemy city by itself. One ranged strike from a city followed by one shot from a garrisoned [Archer%20%28Civ5%29](Archer) will often destroy a Catapult.
Aside from their usefulness when attacking cities, garrisoned Catapults can provide a strong defense against attacks. They have higher Ranged Strength than Archers and can earn the Accuracy, Barrage, and Range [Promotions%20%28Civ5%29](promotions) to make their attacks deadlier to incoming land and [Naval%20units%20%28Civ5%29](naval units).
