# Coastal (Civ5)

In "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)", a coastal tile is a land tile that is directly adjacent to one or more [Coast%20%28Civ5%29](coast) tiles.
A coastal [City%20%28Civ5%29](city) is a city founded on a coastal tile. All [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ5](naval units), as well as several [List%20of%20buildings%20in%20Civ5](buildings) and [List%20of%20wonders%20in%20Civ5](wonders), can be built only in coastal cities. However, such cities are also subject to attack by naval melee units, and will need to be defended appropriately.
