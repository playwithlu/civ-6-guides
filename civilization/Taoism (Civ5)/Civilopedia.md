# Taoism (Civ5)/Civilopedia

Taoism is a unique religion, founded on the basis of the ancient beliefs and philosophies of the Chinese kingdoms of the 2nd century AD. Although not attributed directly to a single founding figure, Taoism grew based on the writings of the philosopher Lao-Tsu, who wrote the "Tao Te Ching" in the 4th century BC. Zhang Daoling, the first "Celestial Master," founded the first school of Tao based on the works of Lao-Tsu.
Quickly gaining converts as he preached the philosophies of Lao-Tsu, Zhang Daoling spread the basic doctrine of Tao. One of the religion's best known aspects, Yin and Yang, represent the world filled with complimentary forces in harmony and balance, a common example being light and dark. Followers of Taoism are encouraged to exercise humility, kindness, and compassion in their daily lives in order to maintain this balance.
Throughout its history, Taoism has had many sects and branches split from the original school, as elements of Chinese tradition crept into the philosophy. Magic, alchemy, and other mystical forces have all been included in some forms of Taoist thought since its early days. Although estimates of the total number of Taoist followers vary widely, it is believed that there are still several million believers living in China and the surrounding regions today.
