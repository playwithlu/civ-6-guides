# Literary Tradition (Civ6)

Literary Tradition is a Wildcard [Policy%20Cards%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
This Wildcard Policy is the only possible way to boost [Great%20Writer%20%28Civ6%29](Great Writer) acquisition, and is available quite early in the game. {{Culture6}}-oriented players, especially those aiming for [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Cultural Victory), should consider making it a (more or less) permanent part of their [Government%20%28Civ6%29](government). {{Writing6}} Great Works of Writing are universally useful, and may be slotted in the earliest [Theater%20Square%20%28Civ6%29](Theater Square) [Buildings%20%28Civ6%29](building) - the [Amphitheater%20%28Civ6%29](Amphitheater) - so it is all pretty straightforward.
