Detailed Approach.
As the first civilization in recorded history, Sumeria shines right out of the gate. Their [War-Cart%20%28Civ6%29](War-Carts) and [Ziggurat%20%28Civ6%29](Ziggurats) are buildable from the very first turn, and Gilgamesh's special ability (based on fighting joint wars) comes early too, unlocking with the [Foreign%20Trade%20%28Civ6%29](Foreign Trade) [Civic%20%28Civ6%29](civic). Gilgamesh will build War-Carts and get out hunting [Barbarian%20%28Civ6%29](Barbarian) Camps early, so he can take advantage of his Epic Quest ability. He will also scatter the edges of nearby [River%20%28Civ6%29](Rivers) with Ziggurats to push forward early in and . Other civilizations will be tempted to ally with Gilgamesh to gain the Adventures with Enkidu bonus while fighting joint wars. With a quick start and a few successful joint wars, Sumeria should be able to move into a dominant position they can maintain to victory.
