Great Library entry.
Artifacts of archery can be traced back at least 40 thousand years, though no single civilization can lay claim to its invention. The primitive bows were made of a single piece of yew or elm and could be as tall or taller than the wielder. The greatest boon to archers was the development of the recurved composite, or compound bow which allowed for a more compact weapon of greater strength and range-up to 90% efficiency in energy transfer from the bow to the arrow.
