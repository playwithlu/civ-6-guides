# Vienna (Civ6)/Civilopedia

The Habsburgs have made a mess of Vienna. Once the most important city in the Holy Roman Empire, a series of ineffectual emperors has reduced this once-thriving center of culture and trade to a coach with horses mounted at opposite ends. Most recently, murderous political reprisals have left the city without an effective government.
The Ottoman Turks watch and wait. Already they have annexed Hungary and established a Transylvanian vassal state. Their opportunity to lay siege to Vienna's walls may come soon enough. If Vienna falls, could the Polish-Lithuanian Union be next?
