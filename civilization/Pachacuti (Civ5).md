In-Game.
Pachacuti speaks and uses some Spanish-influenced words like "imperio".

Personality and Behavior.
Pachacuti has a decent chance to win through any method, though he seems to favor [Cultural%20victory%20%28Civ5%29](cultural) and [Domination%20victory%20%28Civ5%29](domination victories).
Pachacuti prefers to expand his empire, but his empire will not expand too fast. The [Road%20%28Civ5%29](infrastructure) of his empire is usually one of the best ones.
Pachacuti also puts a priority on enlarging his treasury, and will try to build as many [List%20of%20wonders%20in%20Civ5](wonders) as he can.
Pachacuti tends to raise a somewhat large army composed primarily of infantry and ranged [Unit%20%28Civ5%29](units), and his army will have better than average training. He is very unlikely to try to get [Nuclear%20weapons%20%28Civ5%29](nukes), however.
Pachacuti is not too difficult to make friends with. On some occasions, he will declare friendship with anyone, but he is not always a trustworthy ally.
Pachacuti often tries to befriend and protect [City-state%20%28Civ5%29](city-states). He will almost never try to conquer them.
Lines.
Despite being in the Southern Quechua family, Pachacuti's voice actor seems to speak a variety of Northern Quechua (probably Ecuadorian). It can be seen in some recurring pronunciation differences: "h" = "sh" ("hinam"), "ll" = "zh" ("allipacha"), "q" = "k" ("ñuqami"), and syllable-final "k" and "q" tend to get dropped ("kanchik").
Intro.
Oh ye who remakes the world, your loyal subjects greet you - King Pachacuti! You rule the Inca people. From their beginnings in the small state of Cusco the Incans displayed their potential for greatness, marching to war against their many enemies, crushing their armies into dust and carving for themselves a mighty empire stretching from Ecuador to Chile. Indeed they built the greatest empire ever seen in pre-Columbian America. More than mere soldiers your people were great builders and artists as well, and the remnants of their works still awe and inspire the world today.
Oh King Pachacuti, truly are you called "Earth Shaker!" Will you once again call upon the ground itself to fight at your side? Your armies await your signal. Will you restore the glory of your empire? Can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time?
