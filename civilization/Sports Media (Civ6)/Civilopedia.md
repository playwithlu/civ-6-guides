# Sports Media (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Professional and college sports have become the remedy to relieve the sheer boredom of civilization (now that most folk don’t have to worry overly about starvation, disease, and war). To feed that craving for excitement, sports journalism rose to the fore in newspapers; according to Tracy Everbach, “flamboyant sports writing in the era of yellow journalism attracted newspaper readers” by the millions. The 1920s ushered in the daily sports page, turned to first more than any section, other than the obituaries. The Associated Press soon added a sports department. In the 1930s, sports media dominated radio, and then shifted to television – with networks paying ever more enormous sums to broadcast live events. And now, sports coverage is inundating the internet.
