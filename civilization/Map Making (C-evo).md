# Map Making (C-evo)

Map Making in the free game [C-evo](C-evo) can be researched very early and may have immediate benefits as well as leading to longer-term gains, particularly related to water.
The earliest benefit is usually the addition of {{LinkC-evo|trade}} points to {{LinkC-evo|tile}}s containing {{LinkC-evo|river}}s.
Its most important value is usually allowing the designing and building of {{LinkC-evo|naval unit}}s - but that depends on the amount of water available for them, which can be insignificant if the {{LinkC-evo|map}} has a high proportion of {{LinkC-evo|land}} tiles. Such units have a {{LinkC-evo|module}} cost of 8, which is not increased by {{LinkC-evo|Engineering}} but goes up to 10 if you have researched {{LinkC-evo|Navigation}}. See [C-evo%20advances%20affecting%20naval%20units](C-evo advances affecting naval units) for details.
Map Making leads to {{LinkC-evo|Seafaring}}, which allows the building of {{LinkC-evo|Harbor}}s, adding {{LinkC-evo|food}} points to {{LinkC-evo|coast}}al water tiles
The other value is enabling a nation to build "The {{LinkC-evo|Lighthouse}}", a {{LinkC-evo|Wonder}} that adds {{LinkC-evo|material}} yield to {{LinkC-evo|coast}}al water tiles, though it may eventually be obsoleted.
