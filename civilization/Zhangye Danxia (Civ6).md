Strategy.
Different from the majority of Natural Wonders, Zhangye Danxia does not grant any tile yield, but and points. Hence this is not a Natural Wonder players should prioritize during the early game (Ancient and early Classical) in terms of helping you construct infrastructure but can help you earn a head start on important (if you are an early warmonger) or (especially the powerful [Zhang%20Qian%20%28Civ6%29](Zhang Qian)) without having to build the respective s. However, if you plan on mass-building [Encampment%20%28Civ6%29](Encampments) and [Commercial%20Hub%20%28Civ6%29](Commercial Hubs) (which you should not really go overboard and build Encampments everywhere), this Natural Wonder becomes rather redundant and insignificant, so don't go out of your way for it. Three extra Era Scores for settling nearby is nice, but it is definitely not worth settling in an indefensible spot, especially when the bonus cannot justify such action.
If you can't make a [National%20Park%20%28Civ6%29](National Park) out of your portion of Zhangye Danxia, it will still provides a good boost for a [Holy%20Site%20%28Civ6%29](Holy Site) or two.
