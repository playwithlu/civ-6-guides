# Spy (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Related to scouts and explorers, a spy is an intelligence gatherer. Unlike military scouts, a spy usually works alone,
and has very few contacts with his government or agency, to better contain damage to the spy network if uncovered.
Unlike explorers, spies are not interested in knowledge for academia or profit, but very specifically for military
intelligence. The duty of the spy is to record troop movements and root out other spies and assassins. The
assassin is the primary target of the spy, and he will do his utmost to see them tracked and
eliminated.
