# Symphony (Civ6)/Civilopedia

The song runs through everything. It is a symphony, played not by instruments but sung by innumerable tiny mouths hidden in the spaces between things - cracks in the floorboards, cracks in the ground, cracks in the spaces between atoms. It sings of those who sleep and those who will wake. It sings of those who lie dead, dreaming.
