# Land Surveyors (Civ6)

Land Surveyors is an Economic [Policy%20Cards%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
This Economic Policy is rarely useful, unless you really need to expand your territory quickly. The savings you'll get for purchasing a single [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tile) are hardly worth the opportunities you'll lose when not using other Economic Policies. 
Adopting this Policy for a short time may be justified when you found a new [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) close to a competitor, and you need to quickly expand to include tiles that otherwise may be taken by him or her. It is also handy when you have low {{Culture6}} output and your cities keep expanding to the wrong tiles. Make sure you have the necessary {{Gold6}}, though, or that you will get it shortly (in the time it takes to develop your next [Civics%20%28Civ6%29](civic)); otherwise you are again wasting opportunities.
