# American (Civ4)

The American people represent a [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ4](civilization) in "[Civilization%20IV](Civilization IV)".
Strategy.
In "Civilization IV", the American civilization has the choice between [Washington%20%28Civ4%29](George Washington) and [Roosevelt%20%28Civ4%29](Franklin D. Roosevelt) as its [Leaders%20%28Civ4%29](leaders), with [Lincoln%20%28Civ4%29](Abraham Lincoln) as an additional leader in the ' expansion pack. America's [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ4](unique unit) is the [Navy%20SEAL%20%28Civ4%29](Navy SEAL), which replaces the [Marine%20%28Civ4%29](Marine), gains 1-2 [First%20strike%20%28Civ4%29](first strikes), and starts with the [March%20%28Civ4%29](March) [Promotion%20%28Civ4%29](promotion). With the ' expansion pack, America gains the [Mall%20%28Civ4%29](Mall) [List%20of%20buildings%20in%20Civ4](unique building), which replaces the [Supermarket%20%28Civ4%29](Supermarket) and grants bonuses to commerce (and happiness with [Hit%20Musicals%20%28Civ4%29](Hit Musicals)/[Hit%20Singles%20%28Civ4%29](Singles)/[Hit%20Movies%20%28Civ4%29](Movies)).
Washington is very much a jack-of-all trades leader, although his [Charismatic%20%28Civ4%29](Charismatic) [Leader%20trait%20%28Civ4%29](trait) gives him a good incentive to go to war. No matter which way you play the game, you will end up with higher health and happiness caps, and thus can build bigger and better [City%20%28Civ4%29](cities). On a water-based [Map%20%28Civ4%29](map), he can also utilize the [Harbor%20%28Civ4%29](Harbor) to get some extra gold, though likely not as much as Roosevelt would save with his [Organized%20%28Civ4%29](Organized) trait.
The Americans, in general, are a good civilization to play on Archipelago maps. In addition to having a unique unit that starts with the [Amphibious%20%28Civ4%29](Amphibious) promotion, starting with [Fishing%20%28Civ4%29](Fishing) allows them to create [Fishing%20Boats%20%28Civ4%29](Fishing Boats) as soon as the game begins.
