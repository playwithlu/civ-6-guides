# University (Civ6)

The University is an advanced [Science%20%28Civ6%29](scientific) [Building%20%28Civ6%29](building) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is built in the [Campus%20%28Civ6%29](Campus) [District%20%28Civ6%29](district) and requires a [Library%20%28Civ6%29](Library) (or one of its replacements).
Strategy.
The University is a mid-level building that boosts a city's {{Science6}} output.
The {{Link6|Great Scientist}} {{Link6|Isaac Newton}} can be used to instantly build a Library and a University in a Campus and to give an extra +2 {{Science6}} to all Universities.
Building two Universities triggers the {{Eureka6}} for [Printing%20%28Civ6%29](Printing), and building one next to a [Mountains%20%28Civ6%29](Mountain) triggers the {{Eureka6}} for [Astronomy%20%28Civ6%29](Astronomy).
In "", each scientific [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-state) with 6 or more {{Envoy6}}s gives an additional +2 {{Science6}} in each University.
