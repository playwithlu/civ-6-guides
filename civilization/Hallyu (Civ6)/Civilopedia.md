# Hallyu (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Hallyu is the term for the “Korean Wave” of music and entertainment that has swept through Asia and the rest of the world since the end of the Twentieth Century. The success of this culture is credited to the efficacy of South Korea’s entertainment industry in spreading music (such as K-pop) and TV dramas (usually lumped together as K-drama). The term is occasionally used to describe any explosion of a nation’s cultural output across the world.
