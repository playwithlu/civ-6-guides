# Dromon (Civ5)

Game Info.
Unique naval ranged unit of the [Byzantine%20%28Civ5%29](Byzantine) [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilization). Replaces the [Trireme%20%28Civ5%29](Trireme).
Strategy.
The Dromon is the only naval ranged unit available right from the [Ancient%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Ancient Era). Its spectacular Greek fire attack works the same way as that of the latter [Galleass%20%28Civ5%29](Galleass), but looks much cooler.
Needless to say, having a ranged naval unit at this point in the game gives the Byzantines an important advantage in the early game. Try to build some as soon as possible, and then use them to terrorize or conquer any nearby [Coastal%20%28Civ5%29](coastal) [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities). Dromons are also very useful against [Barbarian%20%28Civ5%29](Barbarians) along the coasts, allowing your fleet to deal with them unchallenged while a single land unit moves in to clear their encampments. The only drawback to all these advantages is that Dromons can't melee attack, and thus can't capture cities. However, this problem is quite easily circumvented.
The Dromon upgrades to aÂ [Galleass%20%28Civ5%29](Galleass) in the [Medieval%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Medieval Era), and unfortunately doesn't transfer its Bonus vs. Naval.
