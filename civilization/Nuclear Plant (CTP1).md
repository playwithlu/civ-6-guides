# Nuclear Plant (CTP1)

Nuclear Plant is a [List%20of%20buildings%20%28CTP1%29](city improvement) in "Civilization: Call to Power".
Effect.
The Nuclear Plant provides a cheap boost of 50% in the city's production, but with some risk. The Nuclear Plant creates minimal amounts of radioactive waste, which require disposal and storage for up to thousands of years before the radioactivity dissipates. Also, three-eyed fish and phocomelia are not unknown to the citizens who live nearby. No correlation has been conclusively drawn between proximity to the plant and the defects, however, and overall pollution is greatly reduced.
Great Library entry.
Turning nuclear power to commercial use, the Nuclear Plant created a controlled nuclear reaction. This operation was simple in theory; unfortunately, related accidents and issues of waste disposal were not. If cooling systems failed, a reactor's heat could rise turning fuel rods into molten uranium hot enough to breach the core. Even if a breach never occurred, a plant still generated radioactive waste that must be stored for hundreds of years in containers of glass and lead. As always, energy was not free.
