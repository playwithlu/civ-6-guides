# Battleship (Civ1)

The Battleship has a visibility range of two sea squares, and can bombard units in coastal land squares.
Civilopedia entry.
The most powerful surface warship ever built, the Battleship was the queen of the seas until the appearance of its deadly nemesis, the Carrier. Heavily armored and difficult to destroy, it possessed massive guns that could accurately fire heavy projectiles for many miles. The Battleship had two primary military functions, clearing the seas of enemy ships and inflicting punishing bombardments upon enemy coastal targets, especially in preparation for invasion.
