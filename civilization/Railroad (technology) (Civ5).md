# Railroad (technology) (Civ5)

Game Info.
When the steam engine is first applied to a land transportation machine, the result is a heavy, bulky and unwieldy, but very powerful and incredibly fast. Soon the Railroad concept is developed - a network of iron tracks, onto which sets of steam wagons are capable of moving much faster than carts on roads. The modern transportation network is born.
