Civilopedia entry.
Compulsory enrollment in the armed forces, or Conscription, was introduced in France during the Revolution. It was thought necessary and equitable by the new government surrounded by enemies. In the era of national mobilization for war that followed, wartime Conscription was instituted by many nations, including most major participants in the World Wars. In the U.S., peacetime Conscription was maintained for nearly 30 years following World War II.
