# Porcelain Tower (Civ5)/Civilopedia

Constructed by the Ming Dynasty in the 15th century, the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing was one of the most extraordinary architectural achievements of Chinese history. The tower was some 97 feet in diameter, with a height of 260 feet.
The exterior of the building was built of white porcelain bricks that shone like mirrors in the sunlight. At night the tower was hung from top to bottom with over 100 lamps. The tower stood in the center of Nanjing until 1854 when it was destroyed during the Taiping Rebellion.
