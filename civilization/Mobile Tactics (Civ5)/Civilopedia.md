# Mobile Tactics (Civ5)/Civilopedia

Mobile tactics are strategies implemented by military forces to allow for quick, highly maneuverable units to get in and out of battle without becoming mired in an ongoing engagement. Mobile tactics are often used by irregular or guerrilla units who specialize in hit-and-run attacks aimed at disorienting larger forces.
