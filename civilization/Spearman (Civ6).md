# Spearman (Civ6)

The Spearman is an [Ancient%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Ancient Era) [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Anti-cavalry](anti-cavalry unit) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
The Spearman is a more advanced early unit than the [Warrior%20%28Civ6%29](Warrior), and very effective against cavalry. It is also more effective than the Warrior against [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Ranged](ranged units) and when attacking [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities). However, the Spearman is at a disadvantage against the other frontline unit group, represented by the Warrior, so do "not" become overly dependent on it! A mixed force of Warriors and Spearmen should be your bet if you want early game domination.
[Barbarian%20%28Civ6%29](Barbarian) outposts are always guarded by a Spearman until the [Medieval%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Medieval Era), meaning attacking them with [Horseman%20%28Civ6%29](Horsemen) or [Heavy%20Chariot%20%28Civ6%29](Heavy Chariots) is generally not a good idea.
