# National Intelligence Agency (Civ5)

Game Info.
Intelligence national wonder. Requires a [Police%20Station%20%28Civ5%29](Police Station) in all [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities).
Strategy.
The National Intelligence Agency provides a great boost for your [Espionage%20%28Civ5%29](espionage) activities, by promoting all existing spies and granting an additionalÂ spy. This is more useful to some [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilizations) than others, but is especially useful to those striving for a [Diplomatic%20victory%20%28Civ5%29](diplomatic victory). Unfortunately, this wonder is available quite late in the game, so you will need to build lots of [Constabulary%20%28Civ5%29](Constabularies) and Police Stations. Try to set out and build them early, then halt your expansion until you finish the wonder - remember, every new city you found must also have the required [Building%20%28Civ5%29](building)!
