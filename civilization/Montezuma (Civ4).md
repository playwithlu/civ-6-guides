General Info.
Montezuma has a reputation amongst "Civilization IV" players as a psychopath who will almost always declare war on you, even if he is the lowest in score. He trains a lot of [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ4](units) and usually defeats even the most advanced military with overwhelming numbers, so if you encounter him it is recommended to build a large military. Since Montezuma is not good at research, a large and sufficiently advanced army will be able to beat him.
