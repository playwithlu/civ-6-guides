Aqueducts transport water over great distances, enabling the distribution of water over a much wider area. City planners can use Aqueducts to feed plumbing systems and promote the of a city by making the most basic of resources available to all.
Great Library entry.
Perhaps the most famous Roman masonry achievement was their system of water-bearing aqueducts. The vast system that served the capital of the Roman Empire was a feat of engineering. From 312 BC to 226 AD, Roman engineers built 11 aqueducts, some of which remained in use until modern times, designed to bring water to Rome from as far away as 57 miles. Contrary to modern belief, only about 30 miles of about 260 miles of aqueducts crossed over valleys on stone arches; most of the system consisted of underground conduits made of stone and terracotta pipe, wood, leather, lead and bronze. Water flowed by the force of gravity alone and usually went through a series of distribution tanks in the city. Excess water was not stored, but rather used to flush out Rome's elaborate sewer system and supply the famous fountains. The Romans constructed aqueducts throughout their empire, and remnants of stone arches in Greece, Italy, France, Spain, North Africa and Asia Minor survived well into modern times.
