# Free slave (CTP1)

Great Library entry.
Abolitionists fought to end the institution of slavery and to set those in bondage free. During the 1800's American abolitionists created a network of routes to aid slaves in their escape from the South to the free states of the North and Canada. In 1830 this network earned the name "Underground Railroad." The Underground Railroad served almost one hundred thousand slaves between 1830 and 1865.
