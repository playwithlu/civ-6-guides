# John Curtin (Civ6)

John Curtin (8 January 1885 â€“ 5 July 1945) was the 14th , serving from 1941 to 1945 and dying just before the end of , during which his leadership was instrumental in directing the country's war effort against aggression in the . He leads the [Australian%20%28Civ6%29](Australians) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Australia views the [Map%20%28Civ6%29](map) with a unique eye, looking for areas of high [Appeal%20%28Civ6%29](Appeal) and open lands for livestock. Settling in lands others do not want allows them to build a strong civ, made even stronger when John Curtin leads them in wars of defense or liberation.
Intro.
 Prime Minister Curtin, you will lead Australia through challenge after challenge, and your people will emerge all the stronger for it. Others will seek friendship for your strength. If these friends prove loyal, your might and protection will carry you far. But stay vigilant, for aggression is not your natural course.
In-Game.
Curtin's unique [Agenda%20%28Civ6%29](agenda) is Perpetually on Guard. He likes civilizations that liberate captured [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) and dislikes civilizations that are occupying enemy cities.
His [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader ability) is Citadel of Civilization. It provides the Australians with a 100% bonus if they have either been the target of a declaration of war in the past 10 turns or liberated a city in the past 20 turns (10 in "").
Detailed Approach.
Australia loves the [Coast%20%28Civ6%29](coasts). Settling there affords them plenty of and high Appeal tiles that they can transform into bonus yields for their s. They will want to spread inland from those [Coastal%20%28Civ6%29](coastal) cities wherever they can find livestock, using their [Pasture%20%28Civ6%29](Pasture) [Culture%20Bomb%20%28Civ6%29](culture bomb) ability on those [Resources%20%28Civ6%29](resources) to gain the room needed for adjacent [Outback%20Station%20%28Civ6%29](Outback Stations). In the diplomatic sphere, John Curtin's abilities set them up to be the perfect police force. They don't like aggressive civs and will send their [Units%20%28Civ6%29](units), especially their trusty [Digger%20%28Civ6%29](Diggers), out to repel invaders and liberate cities when possible.
