# Olive Oil (Civ3)/The Rise of Rome/Civilopedia

Beginning around 5000 BC, olive cultivation spread from Crete to other parts of the Mediterranean area. Olive culture
reached southern Italy and then North Africa by the 8th century BC Under Roman rule, thousands of olive trees were
planted and cultivated throughout the Mediterranean basin. In ancient Greece and Rome, olive oil was an important
commodity; special ships were built just for transporting it from Greece and Italy to trading posts around the
Mediterranean. There was a widespread belief at the time that olive oil prolonged youth and life in general. Even today,
the value of “extra-virgin” olive oil is recognized as it helps the body to assimilate vitamins A, D and K.
