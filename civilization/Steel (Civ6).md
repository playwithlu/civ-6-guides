# Steel (Civ6)

Steel is a [Modern%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Modern Era) [Technology%20%28Civ6%29](technology) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It can be hurried by building a [Coal%20%28Civ6%29](Coal) [Mine%20%28Civ6%29](Mine) and an [Ironclad%20%28Civ6%29](Ironclad).
Strategy.
There aren't that many new construction materials invented during the ages - straw, wood, stone, marble, steel - but this last one proves more useful for a wider range of things than any of the others, seeing how little by little it turns into the basis of modern-day construction of everything from ships to buildings.
Thanks to steel, two new very important [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](units) become available: the [Artillery%20%28Civ6%29](Artillery) on land, and the [Battleship%20%28Civ6%29](Battleship) in the sea, which is truly the first modern ship. Steel also immediately finds its way into civilian construction, and improves the workings of the [Lumber%20Mill%20%28Civ6%29](Lumber Mill). Finally, it reveals in [vanilla](vanilla) "Civilization VI" and "", which is necessary to build the [Tank%20%28Civ6%29](Tanks) and [Aircraft%20Carrier%20%28Civ6%29](Aircraft Carriers) that become available soon afterward.
If you're going for a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Cultural Victory), you may want to postpone researching Steel until you've constructed advanced [Walls%20%28Civ6%29](Walls) in your [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities). The [Urban%20Defenses%20%28Civ6%29](Urban Defenses) that Steel provides will prevent you from building new Walls, and you'll miss out on the they provide after discovering [Conservation%20%28Civ6%29](Conservation).
In the [Civilization%20VI%20February%202019%20Update](February 2019 Update) Steel was changed so that it now unlocks the [Oil%20Well%20%28Civ6%29](Oil Well), which used to be unlocked with [Combustion%20%28Civ6%29](Combustion).
