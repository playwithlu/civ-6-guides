Strategy.
The Tank is the next-generation modern cavalry. The classical tank design is now developed, with a turret capable of rotating 360 degrees, which houses the tank's main weapons: a cannon and a machine gun. Thanks to both its design and an improved engine, the machine is faster (5 MPs) and more powerful than the Landship it replaces, conveying its great power to punch holes in enemy lines and retreat quickly.
Be wary of anti-armor units when using it! If the enemy has access to [Helicopter%20Gunship%20%28Civ5%29](Helicopter Gunships), they may hunt down your retreating Tanks, so try to search out those and destroy them with [Fighter%20%28Civ5%29](Fighter) planes first.
