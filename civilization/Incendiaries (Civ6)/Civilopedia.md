# Incendiaries (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Throwing lit torches on spears worked pretty well, but firing incendiary arrows worked even better. Built-up areas throughout history have tended to burn nicely, making defenders decidedly uncomfortable, and so ancient generals quickly found that attacks on cities and districts were more successful when a rain of fiery missiles could be laid down. Flaming projectiles fired from bows, catapults, and cannons have been used ever since the first recorded instances of the Assyrians and the Judeans did so. When gunpowder made its appearance, so did the carcass, a hollow iron projectile filled with a highly flammable mixture to lob over the walls, first used by the French in 1672 AD.
