# Tactics (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Experience in battle helps to make a good army better. Another factor that helps to increase an army’s
ability and effectiveness at fighting is the systematic study of past battles -- what went right as well
as the mistakes. Different armies naturally employed different weapons and tactics; knowing the best
weapon and tactic to employ to effectively counter an enemy’s weapons and tactics very often decides
a battle’s victor.
