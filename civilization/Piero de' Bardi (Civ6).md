Among all of the Great Merchants, de' Bardi is one of the less impactful ones. While both of his bonuses provide useful things, his ability pales when compared to such mighty Great Merchants as [Marco%20Polo%20%28Civ6%29](Marco Polo) or [Irene%20of%20Athens%20%28Civ6%29](Irene of Athens), both of whom are available in the same era as de' Bardi.
