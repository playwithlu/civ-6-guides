Is anybody Out There? Are we alone? The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI), initiated (officially, at least) in the U.S. during the latter decades of the 20th Century, was not immediately successful in detecting the presence of other intelligent life in the universe. However, the research invested in the effort produced many useful spinoff benefits to astronomy, telecommunications, and other fields requiring high technology.
