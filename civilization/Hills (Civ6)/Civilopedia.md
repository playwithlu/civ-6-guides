# Hills (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Desert.
Even less appealing than flat desert, about the only thing desert hills are good for is defending in a battle. Unfortunately, the Bedouins, Tuaregs, Berbers, and other desert tribesmen tended to just charge wildly down them.
Grassland.
One way to protect all those riches was to put troops on top of hills when attacked, for (until bullets and bombs were invented) holding the high ground was a pretty good strategy. Thus, in time, hills were dotted by civilization's forts and castles, with fine views over the surrounding countryside.
Plains.
Hills in plains tend to be landmarks ... just think of the highest point in Iowa, Hawkeye Point, at a stunning 1670 feet (510 meters). Given the flatness all about, these do give nice lines of sight for long distances over the endless, boring vistas.
Snow.
Very picturesque, very invigorating, beloved of skiers and ski jumpers and other fools. Snow on hills is very nice, and a lot of fun ... unless it never melts.
Tundra.
Hills in tundra lands tend to be barren lumps, for the annual melt carries away the soil and seedlings. However, through history, most towns built in the tundra were put on hills ... which helped keep the wolves and bears out of the streets.
