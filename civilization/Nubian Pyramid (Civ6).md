# Nubian Pyramid (Civ6)

The Nubian Pyramid is a unique of the [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It must be built on [Desert%20%28Civ6%29](Desert), [Desert%20%28Hills%29%20%28Civ6%29](Desert (Hills)) or [Floodplains%20%28Civ6%29](Floodplains) (in "[Gathering%20Storm](Gathering Storm)", [Desert%20Floodplains%20%28Civ6%29](Desert Floodplains) only) [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles).
Strategy.
The Nubian Pyramid can be extremely useful when used correctly. Because of Kandake of MeroÃ«, Nubia already gets 20% extra towards s, and that rises to 40% when a Nubian Pyramid is adjacent to the [City%20Center%20%28Civ6%29](City Center).
Nubian Pyramids provide +2 and +2 (+3 if built adjacent to a City Center), allowing these tiles to actually contribute to Nubian Population growth. As +2 on each tile is still not amazing, Nubia should still look to settle on the edge of deserts and not deep within them, unless the city has many [Desert%20Floodplains%20%28Civ6%29](Desert Floodplains) which can be improved with [Farm%20%28Civ6%29](Farms).
Nubian Pyramids can be placed only on [Desert%20%28Civ6%29](Desert), [Desert%20%28Hills%29%20%28Civ6%29](Desert Hills), and Desert Floodplains tiles. As already mentioned, Desert Floodplains should be improved with Farms instead; this will protect any Nubian Pyramids from [Flood%20%28Civ6%29](flooding) damage and simply provide more . The price of settling near these unfavorable tiles is slightly offset by both the extra and from [Mine%20%28Civ6%29](Mines) provided by Nubia's civilization ability.
It would be remiss to not mention the other part of the Nubian Pyramids' ability, which is gaining +1 yield from all adjacent districts (based on their respective yields). Think of this as a [Government%20Plaza%20%28Civ6%29](Government Plaza) in reverse: instead of granting a +1 bonus to all the s around it, it gets bonuses based on the s around it. However, due to the general lack of [Adjacency%20bonus%20%28Civ6%29](adjacency bonus) opportunities in deserts, Nubian Pyramids should be used as a fallback plan. Nubia's s should still aim for their individual highest possible adjacency rather than creating huge clusters of s like [Japanese%20%28Civ6%29](Japan).
Desert tiles without any adjacent s are probably better left unimproved; the build charges spent on improving tiles with Nubian Pyramids are better spent elsewhere. Furthermore, any invaders who pillage Nubian Pyramids will gain much more in one turn than Nubia will probably gain from an individual Nubian Pyramid over the course of an entire [Era%20%28Civ6%29](era).
