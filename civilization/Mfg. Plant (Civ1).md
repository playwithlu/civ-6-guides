# Mfg. Plant (Civ1)

If a Mfg. Plant is built in a city with a Factory, the Factory becomes redundant; it no longer increases production and can be sold off.
Civilopedia entry.
Manufacturing Plants were large industrial complexes that produced goods of all types, but especially durable consumer goods such as the Automobile. A Manufacturing Plant was essentially a large, sophisticated Factory. In addition to specialization of labor, it employed interchangeable parts, complex machinery, and assembly lines to gain efficiency and economies of scale. The result was highly productive workers and relatively low costs.
