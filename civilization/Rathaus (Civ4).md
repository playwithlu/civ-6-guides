# Rathaus (Civ4)

The Rathaus is the [Unique%20building%20%28Civ4%29](unique building) of the [Holy%20Roman%20%28Civ4%29](Holy Roman) [Civilizations%20%28Civ4%29](civilization) in "".
Strategy.
Compared to the [Courthouse%20%28Civ4%29](Courthouse) it replaces, the Rathaus reduces the maintenance costs of the [City%20%28Civ4%29](city) it is built in by an additional 25 percent.
Rathauses make empire maintenance cheaper, allowing for a faster expansion rate. Building Courthouses in every city cuts city maintenance in half - Rathauses cut that number in half again. That's great for securing more resources, especially with [Charlemagne%20%28Civ4%29](Charlemagne's) cheap [Settler%20%28Civ4%29](Settlers), or going to battle with his war-focused traits.
One issue, however, is unlike the other Courthouse replacements, Rathauses are still as expensive as normal Courthouses. And since Charlemagne isn't an [Organized%20%28Civ4%29](Organized) [Leaders%20%28Civ4%29](leader), the cost is quite immense in low-production areas. As such, Rathauses do best in the later game, where plenty of production bonuses help build them up at a reasonable rate.
Of course, the building really shines on [Modern%20Era%20%28Civ4%29](Modern) or [Future%20Era%20%28Civ4%29](Future) starts where it's free - Charlemagne's cheap Settlers can spam cities everywhere with them.
