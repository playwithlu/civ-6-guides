# Crossbowman (Civ5)

Game Info.
[Medieval%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Medieval Era) ranged unit. Upgrades from the [Composite%20Bowman%20%28Civ5%29](Composite Bowman).
Strategy.
Advances in technology produce a new type of ranged weapon, sufficiently strong to punch through medieval armor. At the same time, the Crossbowmen are equipped with mail shirts for protection, allowing them to withstand much more damage than earlier ranged units; still, it is advisable to use them with caution, and protect them from enemy cavalry. Again, the best use for a Crossbowman is to put it on high ground in a well-defended position, where it can rain death upon approaching enemies without suffering counterattacks.
