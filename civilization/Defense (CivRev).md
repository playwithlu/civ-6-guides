# Defense (CivRev)

Defense (or defence) is the bottom value of a [List%20of%20units%20in%20CivRev](unit) when it is attacked. The higher the defense, the better the chance the unit will survive. Units with the [Defend](Defend) order receive 100% boosted defense after 2 turns, +100% when in a [City%20%28CivRev%29](city) with [Walls%20%28CivRev%29](Walls), and +50% if it has a [Palace%20%28CivRev%29](Palace). They also make fortresses when outside cities to give another +100% boost after 5 turns.
