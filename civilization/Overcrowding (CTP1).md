# Overcrowding (CTP1)

Overcrowding is a happiness problem with which every large city will eventually have to deal. Once a city reaches a certain critical size (dependent on the difficulty level of the game) each additional population will result in a loss of one happiness. The overcrowding can be combated by building improvements which ease overcrowding such as the Aqueduct, or by hiring entertainers and building a variety of city improvements to distract the people from their miserably overcrowded lives. The size limit before a city experiences overcrowding on Prince level is population 6.
Great Library entry.
As agricultural capacity increases, city populations tend to swell in size, eventually filling up the settled land around the city center. In ancient times, large cities suffered from terrible hygiene problems. The introduction of aqueducts and sewage systems helped to contain the spread of disease and allow city populations to grow into the millions. In the modern era, the problems of overcrowding are often psychological, as many urban dwellers have trouble coping with the constant pressure of bustling humanity. As unhappiness increases, the people learn to escape through movies and computer games.
