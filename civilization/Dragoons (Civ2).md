Dragoons were mounted soldiers armed with short muskets who fought, both on horseback and on foot, during the time of the American Revolution. The name comes from the French word for "dragon", and refers to the "fire breathing weapons" used by these troops. British general John Burgoyne utilized a force of Hessian dragoons to attack an American supply base in the Battle of Bennington in 1777. Despite their large numbers, the dragoon mercenaries were severely routed by several detachments from the New Hampshire militia.
