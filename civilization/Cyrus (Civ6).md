# Cyrus (Civ6)

Cyrus II (c. 600 â€“ 530 BC), commonly known as Cyrus the Great, was the founder of the , the largest empire in the world up to that point, stretching from the in the west to the in the east. His policies of and a for local rulers allowed the empire to maintain stability despite its vast territory and multi-ethnic composition. He leads the [Persian%20%28Civ6%29](Persians) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Cyrus looks for juicy opportunities to expand his empire with quick strike [Casus%20Belli%20%28Civ6%29%23Surprise%20War](surprise wars). Once captured, this new territory can be rapidly integrated into the Persian network of [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) connected by a highly efficient [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29%23Roads](road) network.
Intro.
 Claim the crown, Cyrus, King of Persia, for you are the anointed one. With immortal soldiers, and an unwavering faith, you will conquer and rule the peoples of the world. You may see many alliances forming around you, but do not be fooled - such is an antiquated and weak way of navigating the world. Make no promise unless it aids you in achieving your goals.
In-Game.
Cyrus's unique [Agenda%20%28Civ6%29](agenda) is Opportunist. He likes leaders who have declared Surprise Wars and dislikes leaders who have not.
His [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader ability) is Fall of Babylon. It gives all of his [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](units) a +2 bonus for 10 turns when he declares a Surprise War, reduces the [Warmongering%20%28Civ6%29](warmongering) and [War%20weariness%20%28Civ6%29](war weariness) penalties he suffers for doing so, and removes yield penalties in cities he occupies (and, in "", provides them with +5 [Loyalty%20%28Civ6%29](Loyalty) per turn if they have a garrisoned unit). (In "[Gathering%20Storm](Gathering Storm), "declaring a Surprise War only counts as a Formal War for the purpose of [Warmongering%20%28Civ6%29](warmongering) and .)
Detailed Approach.
Persia is at its strongest when it can build a tightly consolidated empire. Their bonuses to internal s make such an empire lucrative. Their [Immortal%20%28Civ6%29](Immortal) unit and enhanced road network allow them to rapidly deploy effective defense forces against any threat. With bonuses from internal trade and the [Pairidaeza%20%28Civ6%29](Pairidaeza), the Persians should be at or near the lead in [Civics%20%28Civ6%29](civics) in most games. It is only when Cyrus needs to expand this empire that he wants to strike outside this shell. Given his bonuses in surprise wars, watch out if you are bordering Persia!
Lines.
Cyrus is voiced by [Arian%20Risbaf](Arian Risbaf). He speaks , although it's very poorly presented because of bad pronunciation and grammar so broken that exact translation is not possible.
