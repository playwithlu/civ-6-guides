# Silver (Civ4)

Strategy.
Silver is a luxury resource. It provides commerce and happiness to the city that works it, but when improved with a [Mine%20%28Civ4%29](Mine), it takes away 1 {{Hammer4}} from the +2 {{Hammer4}} (or +3 {{Hammer4}} with [Roads%20and%20railroads%20%28Civ4%29](railroad)) that the Mine usually provides.
