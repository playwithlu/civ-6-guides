# Kenjutsu (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Kenjutsu : The Way of the Sword.
The goal of Ken-Jutsu, as practised by the Samurai, was to develop an attitude which allowed the Samurai to be perpetually ready, mentally and physically, for any task. The sword (sometimes called the soul of the Samurai) was the tool which helped to reach this high mental attitude.
