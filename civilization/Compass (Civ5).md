# Compass (Civ5)

Game Info.
The Compass is an instrument that is vitally important for sea travel, providing much better orientation when there's no other visible marks on the horizon.
The tech allows the construction of the [Harbor%20%28Civ5%29](Harbor), a very important building for international trade, and improves seafaring and sea trade in several other ways. Also allows construction of the [Galleass%20%28Civ5%29](Galleas).
