# Aetherium Factory (Civ5)/Civilopedia

Aetherium is a substance that seems to defy the laws of the natural world, and its uses are many. Agents of Pulias made this resource the focus of much of their efforts. The Aetherium Factory is able to maximize the effects of even small amounts of aetherium, which can then be used by traders to bedazzle commoners out of their cash or craft highly valued commercial novelties.
