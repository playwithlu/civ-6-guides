# Taj Mahal (Civ5)/Civilopedia

The Taj Mahal stands in Agra, India. It was built in the mid-16th century at the orders of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, as a mausoleum for his wife. Acknowledged as one of the most beautiful structures in the world, the Taj Mahal is composed of rare and brilliant materials imported from across India and Asia - it is said that over 1000 elephants were employed to carry the sandstone, marble, jade, turquoise, sapphires, and other materials used in its construction.
The Taj Mahal complex covers an area of approximately 1000 feet by 1900 feet and consists of a gateway, garden, mausoleum, mosque, and guest house. The first three buildings are clad in white marble and covered with geometric patterns, while the mosque and guesthouse are built of brilliant red sandstone. The buildings are topped with magnificent onion-shaped domes and minarets.
Experts have debated about what makes the Taj Mahal unique and beautiful. Some suggest that it lies in the structures' marvelous proportions and symmetry, while others argue in favor of the way that the marble buildings interact with the light, giving the Taj Mahal ever-changing character as the sun rises and sets. Still others believe that its inherent beauty lies in its purpose - a man seeking to cast in stone his love for his departed wife.
