Great Library entry.
A key to the early exploration of the world was the development of ships. By the middle of the second Millennium, the galley appeared in the Mediterranean. Although this ship was ill suited for the high seas, the galley was perfect for the calm Mediterranean. The Greeks and Romans later improved the galley, adding extra decks and oars. However, the ship remained essentially an inland sea transport.
