# Alchemist's Shop (Civ3)/Civilopedia

This is the workplace of the ancient alchemist, home to secret potions and mysterious concoctions. In it, the
earliest experiments in the sciences of chemistry and medicine occur, as man strives to discover cures and uncover
answers to questions, or perhaps just produce a better-cleaning soap! But beware, all these arcane experiments can
cause some pollution.
