Strategy.
This is the second Military Policy, along with Raid, designed to improve your raiding. That is, gaining some one-time yields from pillaging in enemy lands, without trying to conquer them. The advantage of pillaging s, as opposed to [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](improvements), is that a single district tile may be pillaged multiple times, until all its [Building%20%28Civ6%29](buildings) are destroyed. And this could be advantageous if your army isn't strong enough to really invade and face the [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) defenses, or if you aren't actually after the city itself.
A good strategy is to amass an army of light cavalry units with the [Depredation%20%28Civ6%29](Depredation) , slot both Sack and Raid, then go raid the enemy for a significant boost to your yields! This particular strategy is good for protracted wars, where your goal is not that much taking territory than hindering your enemy.
Remember that if you actually plan to annex other cities, pillaging their districts may be more trouble than it's worth, simply because repairing them back to functionality after you conquer the city may take huge work and render the conquered city much less productive.
