# Astronomy (Civ6)

Astronomy is a [Renaissance%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Renaissance Era) [Technology%20%28Civ6%29](technology) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It can be hurried by building a [University%20%28Civ6%29](University) adjacent to a [Mountains%20%28Civ6%29](Mountain).
Strategy.
Astronomy is the "big brother" of [Astrology%20%28Civ6%29](Astrology) - or rather, its serious brother. While astrology uses a mixture of facts and faith and apply them to celestial bodies, astronomy uses only science. And telescopes. Thanks to it, man discovers that his planet is not the center of the universe. And despite the fact that astronomy proves unable to provide any immediate military or economic benefits, it does something much more important: it proves that man has been deluding himself when it comes to some of the most important facts in nature. This opens the way to true science, which in turn will make all modern technology possible.
The only thing Astronomy unlocks is the [Potala%20Palace%20%28Civ6%29](Potala Palace), a rather powerful [Wonder%20%28Civ6%29](wonder) for a diplomatic game. However, you can delay researching this technology if this is nothing you fancy building, unless you're aiming for another with Astronomy as its prerequisite.
Discovering Astronomy triggers the for [Colonialism%20%28Civ6%29](Colonialism).
