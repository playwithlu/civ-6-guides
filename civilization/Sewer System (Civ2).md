One of the byproducts of large urban centers is a vast amount of human waste. As the city continues to grow, steps need to be taken to move the sewage away from inhabited areas and "treat" it so that it does not become a health hazard to humans or harm the local ecosystem. Sewer systems carry wastewater to treatment plants where the raw sewage is broken down through filtration and chemical processes to remove solids and harmful bacteria. The treated byproduct is then released into rivers and other waterways, where it is eventually washed safely into the ocean.
