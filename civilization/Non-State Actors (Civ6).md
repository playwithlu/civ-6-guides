# Non-State Actors (Civ6)

Non-State Actors is a Wildcard [Policy%20Cards%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "".
Strategy.
Non-State Actors allows your [Spy%20%28Civ6%29](Spies) to choose any available when they gain levels. This allows for many strategic possibilities - for example, you can use [Demolitions%20%28Civ6%29](Demolitions) and [Rocket%20Scientist%20%28Civ6%29](Rocket Scientist) to create a Spy who excels at disrupting other players' [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Science](Science Victory) [Project%20%28Civ6%29](projects), or [Polygraph%20%28Civ6%29](Polygraph) and [Quartermaster%20%28Civ6%29](Quartermaster) to create one who plays a supporting role on the home front.
This policy affects only Spies that are assigned missions or gain levels "after" it is activated - Spies that either were ready for a promotion or successfully complete a mission they were assigned before it was activated will have three randomly-selected promotions to choose from instead of the entire pool.
