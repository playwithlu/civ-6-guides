# Three Stars Each (Civ6)

 is the sixth [Challenge%20of%20the%20month%20%28Civ6%29](challenge of the month) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)", running from April 9 to May 14, 2024.
Intro.
The Babylonians were the first to record the cadence of the stars and planets in the sky. As Hammurabi, can you lead your people into space and secure a Science victory before May 14?
Technology and Civics trees are shuffled and hidden for this event, so Babylon's ability to unlock technological advancements via Eurekas is key. Adding to the unpredictability of this event, parameters including the map and other civilizations are randomized.
Strategy.
This challenge takes place on a random Pangaea [Map%20%28Civ6%29](map) populated by random [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations). The [List%20of%20technologies%20in%20Civ6](tech) and [List%20of%20civics%20in%20Civ6](civic trees) are also randomized, which adds a great deal of unpredictability to the game. To achieve [Victory%20%28Civ6%29](victory), you'll need to be familiar with the different [Leaders%20%28Civ6%29](leaders) and their [Agenda%20%28Civ6%29](agendas) so you can predict how they'll act and react. You'll also need to explore thoroughly and seek out [Mountains%20%28Civ6%29](Mountains) and [Reef%20%28Civ6%29](Reefs) for bonuses.
The [Babylonian%20%28Civ6%29](Babylonians') [List%20of%20civilization%20abilities%20in%20Civ6](civilization ability) cuts their output in half, but allows them to instantly discover a [Technology%20%28Civ6%29](technology) by triggering its . Since all victory conditions except [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Science](Science Victory) are disabled in this challenge, you'll want to slot [Nuclear%20Espionage%20%28Civ6%29](Nuclear Espionage) as soon as you unlock it and send your [Spy%20%28Civ6%29](Spies) on [Espionage%20%28Civ6%29%23Espionage%20Missions](Steal Tech Boost missions) so you can quickly discover [Rocketry%20%28Civ6%29](Rocketry), [Satellites%20%28Civ6%29](Satellites), [Nanotechnology%20%28Civ6%29](Nanotechnology), and [Smart%20Materials%20%28Civ6%29](Smart Materials). Once you've completed the [Exoplanet%20Expedition%20%28Civ6%29](Exoplanet Expedition) [Project%20%28Civ6%29](project) and launched your spacecraft, you just need to build [Lagrange%20Laser%20Station%20%28Civ6%29](Lagrange) and [Terrestrial%20Laser%20Station%20%28Civ6%29](Terrestrial Laser Stations) to speed it along and send your Spies on Disrupt Rocketry missions to prevent your opponents from catching up to you. Alternatively, if you manage to secure some and build a strong enough military to defend yourself from attackers, you can launch [Nuclear%20weapons%20%28Civ6%29](nuclear weapons) to shut down your opponents' [Spaceport%20%28Civ6%29](Spaceports).
Building [Flood%20Barrier%20%28Civ6%29](Flood Barriers) in your [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) will also need to be a high priority in the later [Era%20%28Civ6%29](eras), because everyone will likely be too focused on developing [Industrial%20Zone%20%28Civ6%29](Industrial Zones) for and increased potential to worry about [Climate%20%28Civ6%29%23Phases%20of%20Climate%20Change](climate change).
