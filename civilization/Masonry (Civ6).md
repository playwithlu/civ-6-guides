# Masonry (Civ6)

Masonry is an [Ancient%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Ancient Era) [Technology%20%28Civ6%29](technology) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It can be boosted by building a [Quarry%20%28Civ6%29](Quarry).
Strategy.
The ability to work with stone and use it as a construction material marks another important milestone for an early civilization. Stone buildings are infinitely more stable and resistant than wooden or clay ones, and offer unparalleled opportunities to defend a settlement from foes. Of course, this development also prompts the development of the means to break down these new defenses, manifested by the [Battering%20Ram%20%28Civ6%29](Battering Ram). At the same time, entirely new uses of minerals are revealed, and your [Builder%20%28Civ6%29](Builders) gain the ability to harvest {{Stone6}}. In "", [Qin%20Shi%20Huang%20%28Civ6%29](Mandate of Heaven Qin Shi Huang) can also build [Canal%20%28Civ6%29](Canals) after researching Masonry.
This tech is relatively easy to develop (requiring only [Mining%20%28Civ6%29](Mining), which is usually one of the first techs to research), but its use is not as immediate as other military-oriented techs like [Bronze%20Working%20%28Civ6%29](Bronze Working) or [Archery%20%28Civ6%29](Archery). Namely, Masonry gives access to defensive structures and the means to bring enemy defenses down, and in both cases this means war with another [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization). ([Barbarian%20%28Civ6%29](Barbarians) can never threaten the very existence of your [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) unless you're really inept.) If you don't expect such a contingency, you can delay researching Masonry until the next [Era%20%28Civ6%29](era). And if you feel threatened, you should research it around {{Turn6}} Turn 50.
The only case when you'll want Masonry right away is if your starting location is close to [Desert%20%28Civ6%29](Desert) [Terrain%20%28Civ6%29](terrain) - then you'll want to try building the [Pyramids%20%28Civ6%29](Pyramids), which is one of the most useful [Wonder%20%28Civ6%29](wonders) through the early and middle game.
Note that in order to activate the {{Eureka6}} for this tech you need to build a Quarry, which is on {{Stone6}}, {{Marble6}}, or {{Gypsum6}}.
