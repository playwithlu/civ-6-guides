# Trebuchet (Civ6)

The Trebuchet is a [Medieval%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Medieval Era) [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Siege](siege unit) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)", introduced in the [Civilization%20VI%20April%202021%20Update](April 2021 Update). It upgrades from the [Catapult%20%28Civ6%29](Catapult) (or its replacements).
Strategy.
As walls have grown more advanced, people have discovered the need for bigger and stronger siege equipment. Thus enters the Trebuchet, with much higher strength, allowing it to decimate [Ancient%20Walls%20%28Civ6%29](Ancient) and [Medieval%20Walls%20%28Civ6%29](Medieval Walls). This unit is a must-have for any [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) interested in mid-game conquest, as Catapults have quickly grown obsolete.
Keep in mind that, like all siege-class units, the Trebuchet cannot move and shoot on the same turn without the Expert Crew {{Promotion6}} or boosts to {{Moves6}}. For more details on how the move-and-shoot rule works, head [Movement%20%28Civ6%29%23Siege%20units%20and%20the%20move-and-shoot%20rule](here).
Owning 2 Trebuchets unlocks the {{Eureka6}} for [Siege%20Tactics%20%28Civ6%29](Siege Tactics).
