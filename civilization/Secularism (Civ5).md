This is one of the most powerful boosters in the game, particularly for empires with lots of specialists. The interesting part is that the "type" of specialist doesn't matter; they all get a bonus +2 to their output (which comes alongside their regular output, so for example an Engineer specialist produces +2 and +2 , while a Scientist specialist produces a combined +5 ), and this bonus gets increased further through scientific buildings in [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities). So, the more Specialist-oriented your empire is, the greater and more immediate is the effect of this Policy, regardless of what Specialists are you concentrating on.
After adopting Secularism, try to assign more specialists, as long as you have no other important use for Citizens on the field. The boost in tech development will be visible.
