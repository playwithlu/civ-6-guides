# Skirmisher (Civ4)

The Skirmisher is the [Unique%20unit%20%28Civ4%29](unique unit) of the [Malinese%20%28Civ4%29](Malinese) [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ4](civilization).
Strategy.
Compared to the [Archer%20%28Civ4%29](Archer) it replaces, the Skirmisher has +1 strength and up to 1 additional [first%20strike%20%28Civ4%29](first strike).
Using Skirmishers.
Skirmishers are incredibly effective at early-game defense. Many defensive weaknesses of the Archer are solved by a higher combat strength.
With a higher defensive ability, fewer Skirmishers need to be built to have the same impact as Archers. This allows more focus on development.
Against Skirmishers.
A Mali player may very well keep off researching [Longbowman%20%28Civ4%29](Longbowmen) longer than other players to focus on building [Mint%20%28Civ4%29](Mints), developing [Religion%20%28Civ4%29](religion) (as [Mansa%20Musa%20%28Civ4%29](Mansa Musa) is a [Spiritual%20%28Civ4%29](Spiritual) [Leaders%20%28Civ4%29](leader)) or suchlike - Mali's set-up means that they have multiple priorities at this stage of the game. As such, they can be hit while Mali is focusing on more peaceful [List%20of%20technologies%20in%20Civ4](techs).
Against Skirmishers directly, mounted units can do fairly well due to their higher combat strengths. Giving [Swordsman%20%28Civ4%29](Swordsmen) the [Cover%20%28Civ4%29](Cover) [Promotion%20%28Civ4%29](promotion) can also be effective.
For Skirmishers in [City%20%28Civ4%29](cities), just make sure you have plenty of [Catapult%20%28Civ4%29](Catapults) to weaken cities before overwhelming them. Mali isn't any better at crushing stacks than other nations, so go ahead and send some.
