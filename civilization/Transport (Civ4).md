# Transport (Civ4)

The following units can be upgraded to Transports:
Strategy.
The Transport is a modern era naval ship, and allows the player to deploy their military units to other land masses. It can carry a generous amount of 4 units per ship, allowing a small fleet of Transports to deploy a large military force around the globe. However, the Transport is very lightly armoured, and will quickly fall to other naval ships, such as [Submarine%20%28Civ4%29](Submarines) and [Destroyer%20%28Civ4%29](Destroyers). It is advised to escort them or quickly move units from location to location, stopping enemy units from catching them exposed and defenseless.
