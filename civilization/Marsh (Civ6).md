# Marsh (Civ6)

Marsh is a [Terrain%20%28Civ6%29%23Features](terrain feature) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". Marshes are found on flat [Grassland%20%28Civ6%29](Grassland) [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles).
Strategy.
Unlike in "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)", Marshes are more useful for a [City%20%28Civ6%29](city).

They are not without drawbacks, however. Marshes still impose {{Moves6}} and combat penalties on units. In addition, like [Rainforest%20%28Civ6%29](Rainforests), they will decrease the Appeal of nearby tiles.
