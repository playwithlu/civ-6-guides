# Aqueduct (Civ1)

A city without an Aqueduct may not grow beyond a size of 10.
Civilopedia entry.
A major obstacle to growth in early cities was the scarcity of water. The
answer to this problem in many cases was an Aqueduct: a large, elevated stone
"canal" that brought water from nearby hills directly into the city. This
assured a convenient and dependable supply of fresh water to the city.
Aqueducts allowed cities to grow to unprecedented size, while at the same time
they reduced the incidence of water-borne disease. Not only were larger cities
now possible, but cities could be placed in otherwise inhospitable places, such
as Los Angeles, which is located in a desert.
