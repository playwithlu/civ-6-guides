# Artillery Tactics (Civ3)/Civilopedia

By trade, Napoleon was an artillery officer, and he understood the devastating impact that a
well-placed artillery bombardment could have upon an enemy formation. Napoleon's tactic of a "grand
battery" called for hundreds of guns to be deployed on the battlefield, all lined up to fire en masse
on the advancing enemy force. The tactic often called for a concentration of fire upon a key spot in
the field, followed by a massing of troops to exploit that location once the enemy line fell apart.
In fact, the tactic was so popular that over 50 years later, at the battle of Gettysburg during the
American Civil War, General Robert E. Lee used the massed artillery formation to pound the Union
lines prior to Pickett's Charge.
