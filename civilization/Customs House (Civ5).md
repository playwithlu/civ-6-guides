# Customs House (Civ5)

Game Info.
Great tile improvement. Constructed by a [Great%20Merchant%20%28Civ5%29](Great Merchant).
Strategy.
The Customs House is a great improvement for [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilizations) that want more . It is best to build it in [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities) that have nearby [Resources%20%28Civ5%29%23Luxury%20Resources](luxury resources) and the most advanced economic [Building%20%28Civ5%29](buildings) available to maximize their output.
The [Venetian%20%28Civ5%29](Venetians) can use their [Merchant%20of%20Venice%20%28Civ5%29](Merchants of Venice) to build Customs Houses, but they're usually better off sending these units to conduct trade missions or purchase [City-state%20%28Civ5%29](city-states) instead.
