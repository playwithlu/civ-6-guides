# Heavy Bomber (Civ3)/Civilopedia

As WWII progressed the bombers of the Allied nations, especially, became bigger, more powerful and
"heavier", able to carry a larger and larger destructive payload. In 1942 the first true "heavy
bombers" entered service -- albeit in the European Theatre -- with the "1,000 bomber raid" on Cologne,
Germany. The large bomber formations flew in tight "box" formations, and were protected by long-range
fighters on as much of their mission as possible. By the end of the war, the U.S. had developed the
B-29 "Superfortress", capable of flying 400 mph, carrying a ton of bombs, and flying missions up to
5,000 miles!
