# Cho-Ko-Nu (Civ4)/Civilopedia

Repeating crossbows have a long history, with the oldest accurate written record dating to the Han dynasty (ca. 20-220 A.D.) in China. The Chinese repeating crossbow, the Chu-ko-nu, is an extremely simple piece of equipment. It is claimed to have been invented by Chinese strategist Zhuge Liang (181-234 A.D.), which is arguable since the earliest drawings of the weapon have been found from the buried library of Chu, dating all the way back to 250 B.C. The Chinese repeating crossbow saw its last serious action in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, where photographs show repeating crossbows as common weapons among Manchurian troops. The basic construction of this weapon has remained mostly unchanged since its invention, making it one of the longest-lived mechanical weapons.
