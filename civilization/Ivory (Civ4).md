# Ivory (Civ4)

Strategy.
Ivory is a luxury resource, but it may also be thought of as a "hybrid resource" due to its characteristics. It has some strategic resource-like functions by doubling the production speed of the [Statue%20of%20Zeus%20%28Civ4%29](Statue of Zeus) and allowing the highly-powerful [War%20Elephant%20%28Civ4%29](War Elephant), but also luxury-like function with the happiness it provides and the potential further boost with a [Market%20%28Civ4%29](Market).
War Elephants are more powerful than most units for their time, but require rare Ivory. Unlike [Copper%20%28Civ4%29](Copper) and [Iron%20%28Civ4%29](Iron), however, you can see Ivory right from the start of the game, and it can very much be worth getting some just for those War Elephants.
