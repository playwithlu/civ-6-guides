# Obsolete

In the [Civilization%20%28series%29]("Civilization" series), an obsolete [unit](unit), [city%20improvement](city improvement), [resource](resource), and/or [Great%20Wonder](wonder) is one whose function has been surpassed or replaced by [Technology](technological development). Generally, obsolete units can no longer be [Production](produced), while improvements, resources, and wonders cease to provide their effects. Obsolescence applies as soon as the [Civilizations](civilization) obtains the necessary technology; in several games, Wonders become obsolete regardless of which civ first acquires the tech.
Most games allow obsolete units still in the field to be [upgrade](upgrade)d to newer classes for a variable [Gold%20%28currency%29](gold) cost.
"Civilization III".
[List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ3](Unit) obsolescence behaves similarly to "Civilization II", with two important changes:
[List%20of%20wonders%20in%20Civ3](Wonders) expire only when their host civilization discovers the appropriate [List%20of%20advances%20in%20Civ3](advance). Obsolete wonders are removed from the production menu, and incomplete wonders will prompt a change to the build order.
s and s do not expire in the base game, but can be modded to do so.
"Civilization IV".
Units.
 obsolescence behaves similarly to Civ3: an obsolete unit will automatically in the 's queue without loss of hammers, provided it has access to all necessary s. Existing units can be upgraded anywhere within the [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ4](civ's) for a cost proportionate to the difference in production cost.
Resources.
Obsolete s continue to provide their tile yield, but the civ no longer accrues its associated [trade%20resource](trade resource), and all are cancelled. The civ can still "import" the resource, however. Resources that can become obsolete include:
Buildings and wonders.
Obsolete [List%20of%20wonders%20in%20Civ4](wonders) and [List%20of%20buildings%20in%20Civ4](buildings) are immediately removed from the build order, and all invested hammers are lost. Existing buildings are not removed, and continue to provide output and prerequisites for other production items (e.g., obsolete [Walls%20%28Civ4%29](Walls) still enable construction of [Castle%20%28Civ4%29](Castles), and [Monastery%20%28Civ4%29](Monasteries) will continue to allow recruitment of [Missionary%20%28Civ4%29](Missionaries)). All other output modifiers, such as and points, are nullified.
Buildings that can become obsolete include:
Wonders that can become obsolete include:
"Civilization V".
 obsolescence behaves similarly to "[Civilization%20IV](Civilization IV)". Obsolete units in production will automatically upgrade without losing any invested , provided this will not create a deficit in the [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilization's) strategic [Resources%20%28Civ5%29](resources). Likewise, existing units can only be upgraded if surplus resources are available (where required).
s and [List%20of%20wonders%20in%20Civ5](wonders) do not become obsolete, with the exception of the (with ).
"Civilization VI".
 obsolescence behaves similarly to "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)". Obsolete units in production will automatically upgrade to their "direct" replacement without losing any invested , provided this will not create a deficit in the [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization's) s. For example, the becomes obsolete with , since this enables the , the next [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Melee](melee unit).
s can also become obsolete as the player develops more advanced s, replaced by new cards with more -appropriate effects.
s, s, and s do not become obsolete, although , , and can no longer be built after is researched and cease to provide defensive bonuses.

 and s are not subject to obsolescence. Depending on the player's game settings, s will automatically be flagged obsolete as new components become available; they will no longer appear in the base menu, but remain accessible in the . The player can flag and unflag obsolescence at will.
Units can also be retired, deleting the design from the workshop. This is a manual order by the player. Any units currently in the field will be instantly [disband](disband)ed.
