# Obsolete

In the [Civilization%20%28series%29]("Civilization" series), an obsolete [unit](unit), [city%20improvement](city improvement), [resource](resource), and/or [Great%20Wonder](wonder) is one whose function has been surpassed or replaced by [Technology](technological development). Generally, obsolete units can no longer be [Production](produced), while improvements, resources, and wonders cease to provide their effects. Obsolescence applies as soon as the [Civilizations](civilization) obtains the necessary technology; in several games, Wonders become obsolete regardless of which civ first acquires the tech.
Most games allow obsolete units still in the field to be [upgrade](upgrade)d to newer classes for a variable [Gold%20%28currency%29](gold) cost.
"Civilization III".
[List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ3](Unit) obsolescence behaves similarly to "Civilization II", with two important changes:
[List%20of%20wonders%20in%20Civ3](Wonders) expire only when their host civilization discovers the appropriate [List%20of%20advances%20in%20Civ3](advance). Obsolete wonders are removed from the production menu, and incomplete wonders will prompt a change to the build order.
"Civilization IV".
Resources.
Obsolete {{Link|4|resource}}s continue to provide their tile yield, but the civ no longer accrues its associated [trade%20resource](trade resource), and all {{Link|4|Diplomacy|sec=Tradable Things|export deals}} are cancelled. The civ can still "import" the resource, however. Resources that can become obsolete include:
Buildings and wonders.
Obsolete [List%20of%20wonders%20in%20Civ4](wonders) and [List%20of%20buildings%20in%20Civ4](buildings) are immediately removed from the build order, and all invested {{Production4}} hammers are lost. Existing buildings are not removed, and continue to provide {{Culture4}} {{Link|4|Culture}} output and prerequisites for other production items (e.g., obsolete [Walls%20%28Civ4%29](Walls) still enable construction of [Castle%20%28Civ4%29](Castles), and [Monastery%20%28Civ4%29](Monasteries) will continue to allow recruitment of [Missionary%20%28Civ4%29](Missionaries)). All other output modifiers, such as {{Beaker4}} {{Link|4|science}} and {{Link|4|experience}} points, are nullified.
Buildings that can become obsolete include:
Wonders that can become obsolete include:
"Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri".
Units can also be retired, deleting the design from the workshop. This is a manual order by the player. Any units currently in the field will be instantly [disband](disband)ed.
