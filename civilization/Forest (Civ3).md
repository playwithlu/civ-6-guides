# Forest (Civ3)

Extensive areas of land covered by thick growths of trees and related ground vegetation are classified as forests.
Forests can be present on [basic%20terrain](basic terrain) of [Plains](Plains), [Grassland](Grassland) and [Tundra](Tundra). The yield of a forest doesn't depend on the basic terrain.
There are two types of forest: 'regular' (broadleaf) and pine forest. It is just an eyecandy and doesn't affect anything else.
A [city](city) can be built on a forest tile which immediately [Clear%20Forest%20%28Civ3%29](clears) the forest to the [basic%20terrain](basic terrain). Any [Resource%20%28Civ3%29](resource) present on the tile is kept.
Forest cannot be [Plant%20Forest%20%28Civ3%29](planted) on a city tile.
Clearing forests.
Forests may be cleared for farmland or for [Production%20%28Civ3%29](shields).
Clearing is done by a [Worker%20%28Civ3%29](worker) and usually takes 4 turns ([government](government) workers rates and [Industrious%20%28Civ3%29](Industrious trait) bonus apply).
Clearing a forest for production.
Clearing a forest gives 10 [Production%20%28Civ3%29](shields) that are sent to the nearest city whose [Big%20Fat%20Cross](radius) the forest is in.
If there are several cities equidistant from the forest tile then the shields are sent to the first city encountered following a clockwise-spiral pattern starting at the tile north-east of the tile being cleared.
The shields from the cleared forest cannot be used to [Hurry%20Production%20%28Civ3%29](hurry) construction of a [Great%20Wonder](Wonder) or a [Small%20Wonder%20%28Civ3%29](Small Wonder). Also the production of a city that received shields from clearing a forest for the current construction project cannot be changed to a Wonder or a Small Wonder. This trait can be used to control which city the shields go to: just temporarily change the production of a city to any Wonder, great or small, and the shields will be sent elsewhere.
Chopping a forest for production can be done only once. [Plant%20Forest%20%28Civ3%29](Replanting) and chopping the forest again would not give any shields.
