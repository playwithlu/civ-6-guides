# Alhambra (Civ5)

Strategy.
The Alhambra is one of the two "battle" wonders along with [Brandenburg%20Gate%20%28Civ5%29](Brandenburg Gate) (and perhaps less prominently [Red%20Fort%20%28Civ5%29](Red Fort), [Himeji%20Castle%20%28Civ5%29](Himeji Castle), and the [Great%20Wall%20%28Civ5%29](Great Wall), which provide only defensive bonuses) that provide powerful military bonuses, and are thus ideal for players pursuing a [Domination%20victory%20%28Civ5%29](domination victory). If built in a [City%20%28Civ5%29](city) that has a [Barracks%20%28Civ5%29](Barracks), an [Armory%20%28Civ5%29](Armory), a [Military%20Academy%20%28Civ5%29](Military Academy), and the [Brandenburg%20Gate%20%28Civ5%29](Brandenburg Gate), all [Unit%20%28Civ5%29](units) produced by this city will have access to fourth-tier promotions upon completion. The added boost to {{Culture5}} is also nice.
Although the wonder description does not specifically say so, the Drill I promotion applies only to melee, mounted, armored, and gunpowderÂ units built in the Alhambra's city. In other words, it does not apply to ranged, siege, naval, or air units (e.g., [Catapult%20%28Civ5%29](Catapults), [Crossbowman%20%28Civ5%29](Crossbowmen), and [Artillery%20%28Civ5%29](Artillery)).
A particularly deadly combination made possible only with the Alhambra (or the [Zulu%20%28Civ5%29](Zulus) with the [Total%20War%20%28Civ5%29](Total War) tenet of the [Ideology%20%28Civ5%29](Autocracy) ideology as well as the aforementioned training buildings and the Brandenburg Gate) is the availability of Blitz-promoted [XCOM%20Squad%20%28Civ5%29](XCOM Squads) (or less ideally, [Paratrooper%20%28Civ5%29](Paratroopers)), who can attack the same turn after being paradropped. While such squads (unless Zulu) will be less effective in flat lands due to the necessity of going towards Drill III, having access to quick long-distance attackers that can capture cities dramatically increases the military capabilities of the [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilization) that possesses them.
Also, if you plan on building it, don't build a [Castle%20%28Civ5%29](Castle) in this city beforehand!
While the Drill I is the primary benefit of building the Alhambra, units that have Drill I beforehand, such as [Minuteman%20%28Civ5%29](Minutemen) and [Mehal%20Sefari%20%28Civ5%29](Mehal Sefari), do not gain any bonus from this. While this fact may make it sound like this wonder is useless to the [American%20%28Civ5%29](American) and [Ethiopian%20%28Civ5%29](Ethiopian) civilizations, this isn't true, since both the Minutemen and Mehal Sefari become [obsolete](obsolete) later on and thus they have the later game to benefit from the wonder.
Unfortunately, this wonder is highly competitive, and may not be attainable on high [Difficulty%20level%20%28Civ5%29](difficulty levels). Warmongers in the [Medieval%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Medieval Era) (like [Mongolian%20%28Civ5%29](Mongolia), [English%20%28Civ5%29](England), and the [Songhai%20%28Civ5%29](Songhai)) should rapidly mobilize instead of trying to build the Alhambra.
