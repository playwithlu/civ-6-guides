# Jersey System (Civ6)

The Jersey System is a [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) color selection system introduced to "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)" in the [Civilization%20VI%20February%202019%20Update](February 2019 Update), coinciding with the release of the "" expansion. It is used to prevent two or more [Leaders%20%28Civ6%29](leaders) from having similar color schemes.
Each leader has four "jerseys." If the game determines that a leader's color is too similar to another's, it will use the first alternative. If the first alternative is also too similar, the game switches to the second. There are also several default colors which are used when all of a leader's alternate jerseys are taken.

There are 28 colors used for the jerseys.
