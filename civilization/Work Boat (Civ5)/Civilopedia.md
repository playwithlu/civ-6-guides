# Work Boat (Civ5)/Civilopedia

The sea can provide much to a civilization. This can range from protein in the form of seafood to energy - from whale or from oil. For all of human history, courageous men and women have been going to sea in boats to harvest the sea's bounty. Doubtless they will continue to do so until the end of time, "when the sea shall give up her dead."
