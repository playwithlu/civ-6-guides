# Mobilization (Civ5)/Civilopedia

The term "Mobilization" was first used in military context in the 1850s to describe the assembling of troops and supplies in preparation for war by Tsarist Russia. Mobilization institutionalized the mass levy of soldiers from the citizenry that first occurred during the French Revolutionary Wars. The practice changed the nature of warfare, for new communication and transportation technologies, along with developments in military conscription, made the assembling of massive armies possible, ready to be hurled at an enemy's massive army.
