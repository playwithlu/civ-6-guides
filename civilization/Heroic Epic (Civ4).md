# Heroic Epic (Civ4)

Strategy.
The Heroic Epic doubles its [City%20%28Civ4%29](city's) production when creating [Military%20unit%20%28Civ4%29](military units). This is useful if you expect to do a lot of fighting. It also increases its city's chances of generating a [Great%20Artist%20%28Civ4%29](Great Artist).
This wonder should be constructed in your most productive city. Place your [Military%20Academy%20%28Civ4%29](Military Academy) here, as well as any settled [Great%20General%20%28Civ4%29](Great Generals) so that the units produced here will have higher experience.
