Great Library entry.
One of the major motivations for the development of Sea Colonies was the discovery of vast untapped mineral resources lying just beneath the surface of the deep ocean floor. When combined with advanced robotics and ultra-pressure machinery, the same technology that drives mega mines on the surface can be used to dig vast mineral treasures out of the ocean floor. Undersea mega mines are constructed from the strongest titanium composite alloys as they are often used inside undersea volcanoes, plumbing the Earth's mineral treasures in the most inhospitable of environments.
