# Barricade (Civ6)/Civilopedia

The uncanniness of zombies comes from their ambiguity. Are they simply animate material, or are they living beings of a sort? Defenses against people rely upon a number of things that simply do not apply to walking corpses: pain, intimidation, exhaustion. Barbed wire means nothing to something that cannot feel. Additionally, zombie weaponry is limited: zombies do not build trebuchets; they do not fire arrows. So defenses against the dead treat the un-living not as a thinking enemy, but as moving matter – sharpened sticks to not seek to kill, but to immobilize, towers with retractable ladders provide refuge from enemies without brains to climb a rope, ditches contain enemies who cannot build a bridge. At least, until there’s too many of them.
