# Food (CTP1)

Food is one of the fundamentals of growing and maintaining a Civilization. Each citizen eats an allotment of food measured in {{LinkCTP1|rations}}, which the ruler sets. The level of rations also affects the {{LinkCTP1|city}}'s {{LinkCTP1|happiness}}. A core minimum of food is necessary to keep the citizens alive. However, in order to grow, the city needs a surplus of food. Food is created by assigning a {{LinkCTP1|worker}} or {{LinkCTP1|slave}} to work a terrain tile that creates food. But there are other ways to increase food. {{LinkCTP1|Tile improvement}}s, such as the {{LinkCTP1|Farm}} also help boost food, as do certain {{LinkCTP1|city improvement}}s. {{LinkCTP1|Government}}s and {{LinkCTP1|crime}} affect food production and consumption.

In order to maintain a thriving society, Civilizations require food. Even with the arrival of the Industrial Age, starvation has remained a lurking threat. In 1769, ten million died in India from severe famines. A hundred years later, northern China experienced similar desolation, and in the late 20th century, civil war and drought drove millions more to an early grave.
