# Utilitarianism (Civ4)/Final Frontier/Civilopedia

As development throughout the universe pushed on, a number of minds among the two rival factions of Green theorists and Commerce theorists entered into an odd sort of agreement. While both factions saw human betterment achieved from their respective doctrine, they both agreed on a similar goal - the continued survival of interstellar man in the face of the ever-improving tools of destruction. To this end, many Green theorists and Commerce theorists united and formed Utility theory, known more commonly as 'New Utilitarianism.' While Commerce-favoring Utilitarians did manage to continue their investment in defense technology and fund a sleeker version of the Fighter, Utilitarianism's most significant to the universe was the development of Utopia theory, which promised a much higher standard of living for all people, at the cost of production and income which might normally be used for other purposes.
