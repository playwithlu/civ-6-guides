# Trade (CivRev)

Trade in "[Civilization%20Revolution](Civilization Revolution)" is tied to [Gold%20%28currency%29%20%28CivRev%29](gold) and [Science%20%28CivRev%29](science) production. Trade can be either gold or science depending on what mode a [City%20%28CivRev%29](city) is placed in. It appears as an icon on the [Map%20%28CivRev%29](map) in [Sea%20%28CivRev%29](sea) and [Desert%20%28CivRev%29](desert) squares as a circle with two arrows curved toward each other. Trade is affected by a [Civilizations%20%28CivRev%29](civilization's) abilities, form of [Government%20%28CivRev%29](government), [Wonder%20%28CivRev%29](wonders), and [Building%20%28CivRev%29](buildings). It is also affected by certain [List%20of%20technologies%20in%20CivRev](technology) upgrades, such as [Currency%20%28CivRev%29](Currency). [Wine%20%28CivRev%29](Wine) is the only [List%20of%20resources%20in%20CivRev](resource) which provides trade rather than gold, science, or [Culture%20%28CivRev%29](culture).
