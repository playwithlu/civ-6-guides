# Shopping Mall (Civ6)/Civilopedia

The modern shopping mall is an extension of Ancient Rome's public marketsâ€”albeit with better access to fresh baked pretzel dogs.
Malls, or shopping arcades, centralized collections of shops in one location. Some, like Damascus' Al-Hamidiyah Souq in the 19th Century, were essentially covered markets, while St. Petersburg's Great Gostiny Dvor would offer an earlier "traditional" mall experience in 1785.
By the mid-Twentieth Century, the enclosed shopping complex as we know it would arrive in 1955 with Appleton, Wisconsin's Valley Fair Shopping Center and the Ralph Erskine-designed mall in Lulea, Sweden. Frozen yogurt stands would follow not too long after.
