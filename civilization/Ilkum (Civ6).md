# Ilkum (Civ6)

Ilkum is an Economic [Policy%20Cards%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
This early Policy boosts [Builder%20%28Civ6%29](Builder) production significantly, and as such can become invaluable for your early development. However, like other localized Policies, it is useful only as long as you produce the thing in question (Builders, in this case). Thus, you should choose the right moment to place this card in one of your [Government%20%28Civ6%29](government's) slots, produce several Builders, and then replace it at the next opportunity.
