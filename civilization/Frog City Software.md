# Frog City Software

Frog City Software was a game developer formed in 1994, responsible for the strategy games "[Imperialism%20%28game%29](Imperialism)" (which "was a critical and commercial success, surpassing its original sales goal more than seven-fold") in 1997, "[w%3Ac%3Aimperialism%3AImperialism%202](Imperialism II)" (which "matched the sales of its predecessor, exceeding sales goals by 50%") in 1999, "Trade Empires" in 2001, and "Tropico 2: Pirate Cove" in 1992 ("Sales topped 300,000 units, another critical and commercial success"). 
Regrettably (in the opinion of many players), the company ceased to function around 2006. One of its principals expressed interest in participating in any remake.
