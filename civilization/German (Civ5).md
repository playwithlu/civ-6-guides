# German (Civ5)

The German people represent a [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilization) in "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)".
The [Landsknecht%20%28Civ5%29](Landsknecht) is a German [Unique%20unit%20%28Civ5%29](unique unit) in [vanilla](vanilla) "Civilization V" and '. In the [Fall%202013%20patch%20%28Civ5%29](Fall 2013 patch) for ', it is replaced by the [Hanse%20%28Civ5%29](Hanse) (the German [Unique%20building%20%28Civ5%29](unique building)), but remains available to any civilization through the [Mercenary%20Army%20%28Civ5%29](Mercenary Army) [Social%20policies%20%28Civ5%29](social policy) or allied militaristic [City-state%20%28Civ5%29](city-states).
Strategy.
The Germans are one of the best civilizations in regards to military prowess. Their [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ5%29](unique ability) allows them to both maintain a larger army than normal, and to press-gang [Barbarian%20%28Civ5%29](Barbarians) into their army throughout the game. This is especially useful in the early game when there are plenty of Barbarian [Encampment%20%28Civ5%29](encampments) around, and more so if Raging Barbarians is active. [Unit%20%28Civ5%29](Units) such as the [Horseman%20%28Civ5%29](Horseman) and [Swordsman%20%28Civ5%29](Swordsman) - which normally require [Resources%20%28Civ5%29%23Strategic%20Resources](strategic resources) such as and - do not require or use strategic resources when acquired from encampments, but will require the resource to be upgraded. Once the Germans have researched [Optics%20%28Civ5%29](Optics), units recruited from Barbarian encampments will have the ability to [Embarkation%20%28Civ5%29](embark) when they are received, without needing to enter German [Territory%20%28Civ5%29](territory).
Note that the Germans receive a flat 25 for recruiting the defender of a Barbarian encampment, whereas the amount of acquired when an encampment is captured is dependent on both the [Difficulty%20level%20%28Civ5%29](difficulty level) and the [Speed%20%28Civ5%29](game speed).
However, playing as Germany need not be about conquering. If a [Domination%20victory%20%28Civ5%29](domination victory) is not desired, good use can still be made of the Germans' unique ability by sending out two units together on a permanent mission to seek and destroy Barbarian encampments. This will produce an army strong enough to deter any warmongers while simultaneously leaving [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities) free to build civilian [Building%20%28Civ5%29](buildings) and [List%20of%20wonders%20in%20Civ5](wonders). The [Honor%20%28Civ5%29](Honor) policy tree comes in handy, as it gives notifications about new Barbarian encampments as soon as they appear.
Germany's unique building, the [Hanse%20%28Civ5%29](Hanse), replaces the [Bank%20%28Civ5%29](Bank) and is a very nice way to bolster both income and in the mid-game. Trading primarily with city-states maximizes this special ability.
The [Panzer%20%28Civ5%29](Panzer), mirroring the historic tank brigades of the Third Reich, is one of the most terrifying weapons of the late game, thanks to its enhanced speed and strength.
