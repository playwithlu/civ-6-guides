# Sikhism (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Founded in the 15th Century AD by the Guru Nanak Dev, Sikhism has grown through the efforts of successive Sikh gurus who espoused the virtues of peace, equality, and selfless service. Sikhism currently has over 20 million followers, based primarily in the Punjab region of India. The Sikhs believe in only one god, who has no physical form, but every Sikh has the ability to speak to God, and all are equal in God’s eyes – a very egalitarian faith.
Sikhs are known for their generosity towards others, as one of the primary tenets of their religion is the idea that all people are created equal, regardless of religion, race, or sex. In differing from other major religions, Sikhism supports that belief that acts of good in service to others are more important than any form of ritual.
Sikhs are also bound to defend against injustices, supporting all who are oppressed, as truth and peace should prevail above all else. The Sikhs believe that to attain salvation, every Sikh must practice disciplined meditation, as only through personal observance and focus on God can salvation be reached. Thus, there are a number of restrictions placed on the followers of the Sikh faith, including the requirement that they not cut their hair, not consume any intoxicating substances, and notably, not perform any ritual, superstition or pilgrimage.
