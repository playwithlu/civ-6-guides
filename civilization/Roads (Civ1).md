Civilopedia entry.
Roads of good quality improved communications between cities. This was important for trade and for military purposes. Good quality roads were
passable in nearly all weather, and could be traversed by wheeled vehicles much faster than bare dirt trails. This meant that mounted messengers,
commercial wagons, and military units all could move from one part of the road network to another at good speed. This made it easier for centrally located
armies to reach threatened frontiers. The most famous roads of antiquity were the Persian Royal Road and the Roman roads built throughout southern Europe.
