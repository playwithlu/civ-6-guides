# Mountain

In most "Civilization" games, building a [city](city) on a mountain would be foolish because it would seldom have enough [food](food) to grow, though its defensive strength would be good. In "Colonization" games, a [colony](colony) cannot be built on a mountain. However, many mountain [tile](tile)s contain valuable [resource](resource)s exploitable by miners.
