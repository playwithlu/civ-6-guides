# Great Artist (Civ6)

The Great Artist is a type of [Great%20People%20%28Civ6%29](Great Person) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)" dedicated to the creation of [Great%20Work%20%28Civ6%29%23Great%20Works%20of%20Art](Great Works of Art). Each Great Artist may be activated up to three times on a tile containing an empty slot which accepts Great Works of Art (such as a [Theater%20Square%20%28Civ6%29](Theater Square district) with an [Art%20Museum%20%28Civ6%29](Art Museum), a [Palace%20%28Civ6%29](Palace), or the [Hermitage%20%28Civ6%29](Hermitage)), creating up to three Great Works of Art.
Earning Great Artists.
Great Artists may be claimed by any player who has earned enough Great Artist points. [Theater%20Square%20%28Civ6%29](Theater Squares) and [Acropolis%20%28Civ6%29](Acropoli) generate +1 Great Artist point per turn, +2 more if the city has built the [Oracle%20%28Civ6%29](Oracle), and [Art%20Museum%20%28Civ6%29](Art Museums) and [Archaeological%20Museum%20%28Civ6%29](Archaeological Museums) provide an additional +2 Great Artist points. [Broadcast%20Center%20%28Civ6%29](Broadcast Centers) and [Film%20Studio%20%28Civ6%29](Film Studios) generate a further +1 Great Artist point (for a total of 4 points in that district). The [Russian%20%28Civ6%29](Russian) [Lavra%20%28Civ6%29](Lavra) also provides +1 Great Artist point if there is a [Temple%20%28Civ6%29](Temple) in it. More Great Artist points may be earned by completing the [Theater%20Square%20Performances%20%28Civ6%29](Theater Square Performances) project in a city with a Theater Square. Players who do not have enough points may patronize an Artist by paying the difference using or .
The [Hermitage%20%28Civ6%29](Hermitage) provides +3 Great Artist points every turn, and can house a total of 4 Great Works of Art of any type.
Players can also increase their Great Artist point yields by using the [Frescoes%20%28Civ6%29](Frescoes) policy card, which generates +2 Great Artist points per turn. In , it generates 2 additional Great Artist points per turn for every [Art%20Museum%20%28Civ6%29](Art Museum) owned.
The [Stockholm%20%28Civ6%29](Stockholm) [Suzerain%20%28Civ6%29](Suzerain) bonus (or [Bologna%20%28Civ6%29](Bologna) in ) increases the number of Great Artist points generated from each Theater Square district by +1. (Note that in "", this bonus is only active if the Theater Square has a completed [Amphitheater%20%28Civ6%29](Amphitheater) building.)
All Great Artist point yields are doubled if [Pingala%20%28Educator%29%20%28Civ6%29](Pingala) with the [Grants%20%28Civ6%29](Grants) title is present in the city. Additionally, the [Kongolese%20%28Civ6%29](Kongolese) generate 50% more Great Artist points from all sources.
The [Cathedral%20%28Civ6%29](Cathedral) provides a slot for religious art. Starting in the Modern Era, Great Artists will no longer produce religious artwork.

Strategy.
Among the three classes of "cultural" , Great Artists are undoubtedly the most important one when pursuing a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Cultural Victory). A Great Work of Art provides more than a Great Work of Writing, and a Great Artist can create more Great Works than a Great Writer. Also, Great Artists arrive much earlier to have an impact than s. However, their Great Works have to be micromanaged carefully for optimal effect. Only [Art%20Museum%20%28Civ6%29](Art Museums) and the [Hermitage%20%28Civ6%29](Hermitage) have slots specifically for Great Works of Art, and the former will yield their maximum and bonuses only if they are properly themed (i.e. have all three slots filled with [Great%20Work%20%28Civ6%29%23Sculptures](Sculpture), [Great%20Work%20%28Civ6%29%23Portrait%20Paintings](Portrait), [Great%20Work%20%28Civ6%29%23Landscape%20Paintings](Landscape) or [Great%20Work%20%28Civ6%29%23Religious%20Paintings](Religious) art from different Artists), so you'll need at least three Great Artists to earn the [Theming%20bonus%20%28Civ6%29](theming bonus) from each Art Museum. If you plan to rely on them heavily, be sure to include the [Frescoes%20%28Civ6%29](Frescoes) [Policy%20Cards%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in your [Government%20%28Civ6%29](government), exchange Great Works of Art with other civilizations that are focusing on cultural development, and save up and/or to patronize the Artists you need the most.
