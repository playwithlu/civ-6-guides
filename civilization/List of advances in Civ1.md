# List of advances in Civ1

"[Civilization%20%28original%29](Civilization)" includes 71 advances, from which at least , , and (these with no requirements and no successors) are gained automatically at the start of a game.
To figure the way towards a specific advance, or unit, or building, or the ending of such (smth. becomes obsolete), the first four columns are sortable and the links in the Requirement- and the Leads to-columns are leading to the matching entry in the column Advance of this table, while the links there and in the Allows- and Ends-columns are leading to the respective Wiki-pages.
All requirements are sorted, so each required advance fits completely either into column Req. 1 or Req. 2. Only Currency, Invention, and Medicine are appearing in both columns, so it's a little more effort, to find all matching entries for these three by sorting both columns.
Since in the '- and '-columns sometimes are more than one item per row of the table, at the bottom of this page are two alphabetical sorted jumplists for each in this columns listed item, where the links lead into the respective row of the table.
