Civilopedia.
Lived: 1610-1649
Gabriel Lallemant was a French Jesuit missionary who came to the New World to convert the natives. Born in Paris, Lallemant was guided from a young age towards the clergy, joining the famed Society of Jesus before being called across the sea. Placed among the Hurons upon his arrival, Lallemant worked tirelessly to spread Christianity among the native peoples. Unknown are the exact circumstances how he arrived in the hands of the Iroquois, but what is known is the ultimate result: Lallemant's death. As tribute to his sacrifice, Lallemant was canonized and named a patron saint of Canada.
