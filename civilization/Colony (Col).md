# Colony (Col)

Like cities, Colonies are the primary building blocks of your empire.
Founding.
Any [colonist%20%28Col%29](colonist) can found a new colony. Colonies can be built anywhere except on mountains, water tiles, or right next to existing colonies. It is highly advised to build in a place where the new colony will access to both [ore%20%28Col%29](ore) and [lumber%20%28Col%29](lumber). Forests are plentiful in the New World and therefore finding a site near a source of lumber is usually not difficult. If a colony does not have a source of ore in its radius, the ore or [tools%20%28Col%29](tools) will have to be shipped in from elsewhere.
The center tile of a colony automatically yields two of its resources, and one of these two resources is always food.
The other resource of a center tile is never [lumber%20%28Col%29](lumber), and colonizing a forest tile with lumber as special resource would be a pretty bad idea. If possible the other resource is also never [ore%20%28Col%29](ore). In other words, it will be the best resource (e.g., [tobacco%20%28Col%29](tobacco) or [cotton%20%28Col%29](cotton)) a colonist on an ordinary tile could work on, excluding food, lumber, and ore.
However, [tundra%20%28Col%29](tundra) and [hills%20%28Col%29](hills) offer "only" food and ore, therefore they are the only center tiles where a colony can get ore for free (without colonists working for it).
Colony screen.
Unlike Civ games, only the nearest 8 squares are workable by a colony.&lt;br&gt;
A colony produces a minimum of one [Crosses%20%28Col%29](Cross) and one [Liberty%20bell](Liberty bell), but the crosses are not visible until a [Church%20%28Col%29](Church) is built.
Growth.
If the storage of [food](food) reaches 200, a new [Free%20Colonists%20%28Col%29](Free Colonist) will be born. Note that a warehouse is not required; maximum food storage is always 200.
Abandoning colonies.
If you move the last colonist in the colony to the area in the lower right with a fence, you will prompted,&lt;br&gt;
"Shall we indeed abandon our (name) colony, Your Excellency, forfeiting all of our hard work here?"&lt;br&gt;
If you choose Yes, the colony will be no more. However, if a [Stockade%20%28Col%29](Stockade), [Fort%20%28Col%29](Fort), or [Fortress%20%28Col%29](Fortress) has been built, you will receive the message,&lt;br&gt;
"We cannot voluntarily reduce below three the population of a colony that has a stockade, fort, or fortress."&lt;br&gt;
A colony can never be completely starved to death, because the center tile will always produce enough food to support at least one colonist.
