# FreeCol user manual/Colonies/Using Buildings

Using buildings.
Facilities with immediate effect.
Some [FreeCol%20user%20manual/Colonies/Colony%20Buildings](buildings) have an immediate effect. The [Stockade](Stockade), for example, provides protection for your colony, and the [Docks](Docks) enable your [colonist](colonist)s to go [fish](fish)ing. The effects of these buildings cannot be increased by workers. In the [building%20box](building box) at the top right of the [colony%20panel](colony panel), these buildings are shown in parentheses, like this: "(Stockade)". (Other facilities that you do not build or put units into and that are present at the start of every colony, "[Chapel](Chapel)", "[Depot](Depot)", and "[Pasture](Pasture)", are shown the same way.)
Facilities that need to be occupied.
Most other buildings do nothing if they are unoccupied, but provide workers with a place to produce manufactured goods. The [Tobacconist%27s%20House](Tobacconist's House), for example, allows colonists to make [Cigar](Cigar)s from [Tobacco](Tobacco). Place one, two, or three colonists in a building in order to convert raw materials to manufactured goods, which can be sold for higher prices. For each building, there are [expert%20unit](expert unit)s that work more effectively than [Free%20Colonist](Free Colonist)s. Other units may work less effectively.
Upgrading.
Most facilities can be replaced by more productive ones. For example, a [warehouse](warehouse) replaces the [depot](depot), holding twice as much.
