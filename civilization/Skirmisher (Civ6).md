# Skirmisher (Civ6)

The Skirmisher is a [Medieval%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Medieval Era) [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Recon](recon unit) in "". It upgrades from the [Scout%20%28Civ6%29](Scout) (or its replacements).
Strategy.
Since the Skirmisher is a recon unit and exploration isn't a high priority when the late Medieval Era rolls around, it's very hard to get a lot of use out of this unit. While more durable than the Scout, it has the same {{Strength6}} Combat Strength as the basic [Warrior%20%28Civ6%29](Warrior) and slightly higher {{RangedStrength6}} Ranged Strength than the [Archer%20%28Civ6%29](Archer), it doesn't hold up well against Medieval [Barbarian%20%28Civ6%29](Barbarians) and is unlocked too late to amp up its [XP](XP) gain with the [Survey%20%28Civ6%29](Survey) [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](policy card). Thus, unless you play as the [Incan%20%28Civ6%29](Inca) (whose [Warak%27aq%20%28Civ6%29](Warak'aq) replaces the Skirmisher) or the [Scottish%20%28Civ6%29](Scottish) (who can slot Survey and try to earn the [Ambush%20%28Civ6%29](Ambush) {{Promotion6}} for their recon units before upgrading them to [Highlander%20%28Civ6%29](Highlanders)), you can ignore this unit and your empire won't suffer too much. Until the [Spec%20Ops%20%28Civ6%29](Spec Ops) is unlocked, the main purpose of recon units is exploring safely, and the Scout fulfills this purpose without the {{Gold6}}/{{Production6}} investment the Skirmisher requires.
