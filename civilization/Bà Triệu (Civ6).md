# Bà Triệu (Civ6)

Triệu Thị Trinh (8 November 226 – 4 April 248), better known by the honorific Bà Triệu or Lady Triệu, was a Vietnamese warrior who led an uprising against the , and afterwards became a popular and highly celebrated in Vietnamese culture. She leads the [Vietnamese%20%28Civ6%29](Vietnamese) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Bà Triệu uses her bonuses to [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](unit) [Movement%20%28Civ6%29](speed) and cheaper [Th%C3%A0nh%20%28Civ6%29](Thành) [District%20%28Civ6%29](districts) for an effective defense as she acquires – or as a base from which to launch a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Domination](Domination Victory).
Intro.
 Bà Triệu, your people will remember you as a goddess. Stand against those who would try to rein in your storm, and raise your sword in defiance. Neither family nor foe will hold you back.
In-Game.
Bà Triệu's unique [Agenda%20%28Civ6%29](agenda) is Defender of the Homeland. She likes [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) that have not declared war on Vietnam, and hates those that have, never forgiving their transgression, as her opinion decreases further each turn the war progresses, and this decreased opinion never decays.
Her [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader ability) is Drive Out The Aggressors. Her units gain +5 Combat Strength when fighting on [Rainforest%20%28Civ6%29](Rainforest), [Marsh%20%28Civ6%29](Marsh), or [Woods%20%28Civ6%29](Woods) [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles), and +1 when they begin their turn on them, both of which are doubled if these tiles are in Vietnamese [Territory%20%28Civ6%29](territory).
Detailed Approach.
Vietnam is a tough Civilization to conquer. Where other Civilizations' units get bogged down in tough [Terrain%20%28Civ6%29](terrain), Bà Triệu’s military units gain additional movement and defense while in Marshes, Woods, or Rainforest, giving her a clear advantage when fighting in such regions. Additionally, she can build Thành districts without the typical population requirements, providing an extra layer of defense to her homeland and providing additional . While Ba Trieu’s specialty Districts – not including the Thành, which, unlike the [Encampment%20%28Civ6%29](Encampment) is not a specialty District - are limited to Woods, Rainforest, or Marshes, her [Builder%20%28Civ6%29](Builders) can plant forests earlier, freeing new tiles for new Districts. Vietnam is a highly effective defensive Civilization, well-poised to seek military or cultural [Victory%20%28Civ6%29](victories).
Lines.
Bà Triệu is voiced by [Ha%20Le%20Giang](Ha Le Giang). She speaks modern with a northern (Hanoi) accent.
According to [Andrew%20Alan%20Johnson](Andrew Alan Johnson), the writer of "Civilization VI" from [Firaxis%20Games](Firaxis Games), with Bà Triệu's lines they "were going for that 'list of those who have slighted me' feel; a lot of these will be more present in the non-voiced bits. As far as references to Thang Long and Hanoi... yes, they're anachronistic. I love the name, though, of the ',' and love the grandeur of medieval Thang Long. Better than 'Yep, still up here on that mountain, plottin' your murder...' But a hardcore Vietnam history buff will see some anachronisms. Above all, I really didn't want to refer to any American War tropes, as fan service-y as they would feel."
