# General Education (Civ3)/Civilopedia

A good educational system was very important to Napoleon. Prior to the French Revolution, the
school systems of Europe (and of France in particular) could be seen as desperately lacking.
Poor schools, poorly trained teachers, lack of discipline... all of these traits defined the
educational system that Napoleon inherited from his predecessors. Shortly after his ascendancy to
the throne, the Little Emperor moved to improve the education in France. If France were to rise out
of its Revolution and become the greatest European power, its citizenry needed knowledge.
