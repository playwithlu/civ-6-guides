# Settler (Civ6)

The Settler is an [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Civilian](civilian unit) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is available without any [Technology%20%28Civ6%29](technological) research.
Strategy.
Settlers are used to expand your empire. Whenever a Settler is built or purchased in a [City%20%28Civ6%29](city), that city's Population is lowered by 1 as some of your people strike out to settle new lands.
Conveniently, Settlers have greater than all other starting [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](units), which allows them to spot good city locations from afar. However, don't get tempted to use them for scouting. First, they are much more useful for expanding your empire than wandering around searching for [Tribal%20Village%20%28Civ6%29](Tribal Villages) and such. Second, as civilian units, Settlers are defenseless, and thus it is prudent to escort them with a [Military%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](military unit) as they search for a good place to [City%20%28Civ6%29%23Founding%20a%20City](found a new city). Unlike in "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)", a Settler that is captured from another [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) will remain a Settler under the control of the civilization that captured it.
The cost of a Settler scales according to the following formula, in which "x" is the number of Settlers you've trained (including your initial one):
formula_1
Captured Settlers and conquered cities do not increase the cost of the next Settler, but Settlers received for free do.
