# Alhambra (Civ6)

+2 {{General6}} points per turn 
+1 {{MilitaryPolicy6}} Military policy slot
The Alhambra is a {{Link6|Medieval Era}} {{Link6|wonder}} in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It must be built on [Hills%20%28Civ6%29](Hills) adjacent to an [Encampment%20%28Civ6%29](Encampment).
Strategy.
The Alhambra is a useful wonder for almost any [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) planning on war in the mid- to late game. The extra Military policy slot can bring enormous benefits.
Having the extra {{MilitaryPolicy6}} Military policy slot enables a war-oriented civ to be much more flexible in their [Government%20%28Civ6%29](government) choice. They can choose a government with fewer Military policy slots thanks to the extra one granted by the Alhambra, or they can still choose a war-focused government and accrue many Military policies. [Gorgo%20%28Civ6%29](Gorgo) will want to make this wonder a priority, as it will provide all her [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](units) with +1 {{Strength6}} Combat Strength.
The extra {{Amenities6}} are also important for conquest. Typically, one can only afford to build wonders in their biggest [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities). Adding +2 {{Amenities6}} in one of your biggest cities allows your civilization to distribute [Resource%20%28Civ6%29%23Luxury](luxury resources) to the smaller cities as a result.
Note that the Alhambra, and all [Fort%20%28Civ6%29](Forts) for that matter, also provides fortification bonuses to [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Religious](religious units).
