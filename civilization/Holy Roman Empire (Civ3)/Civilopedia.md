# Holy Roman Empire (Civ3)/Civilopedia

A major objective of European rulers during and after the Dark Ages was claiming the legitimacy of Rome. Popular 
memory of Rome was fond, given how well the average person lived in Roman times compared to the medieval era. Charlemagne 
assumed the title of "Emperor of the Romans" in 800 A.D. when he was crowned. Ideally the Holy Roman Emperor was master of 
all Christendom; whether he was then directly answerable to God or the pope was the subject of much debate (and, on occasion, 
bloodshed). Regardless, the Roman identity was important, since Rome embodied greatness, power, and civilization. Maintaining its 
legacy was, some argued, the legitimate purpose of every monarch.
