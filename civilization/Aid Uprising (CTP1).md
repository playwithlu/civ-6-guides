Great Library entry.
When slaves and abolitionists felt that peaceful negotiation would not end the abomination of slavery, they often turned to violence. Slave rebellions in the United States totaled over two hundred between 1776 and 1865 including the Nat Turner Rebellion in 1831. Turner led a handful of slaves on a bloody crusade which grew in force to more than 80 and killed 60 whites.
