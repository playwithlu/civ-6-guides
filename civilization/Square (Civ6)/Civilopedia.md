# Square (Civ6)/Civilopedia

An infantry square is a formation whereby the infantry close ranks, facing outward on all sides, to deter cavalry attack. The Romans, faced with battling horse barbarians numerous times, devised it according to Plutarch; the legions at the battle of Carrhae, for instance, used the square successfully to neutralize the Parthians. The mounted infantry of the Han dynasty dismounted and formed squares in their many battles against the fearsome Xiongnu. The square formation, which fell out of favor during the Middle Ages, was revived in the 14th century, and would figure prominently during the Napoleonic Wars. Unfortunately, densely packed infantrymen – as in a square – tended to be susceptible to artillery. But they remained the best deterrent to cavalry charges.
