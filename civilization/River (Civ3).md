# River (Civ3)

Rivers do not run "in" squares: instead they run along the edges of squares.
Any square with a river along its edge produces one extra Commerce if worked by citizen laborers within a city radius. Also, rivers are sources of fresh water, allowing [Irrigation%20%28Civ3%29](irrigation) of adjacent squares without [Electricity%20%28Civ3%29](Electricity).
A city that is built adjacent to a river (or another source of fresh water) does not need an [Aqueduct%20%28Civ3%29](Aqueduct) to support a population above 6 (but still has a maximum cap of 12).
If a [Road%20%28Civ3%29](road) is built across a river, the units crossing it will not get the road movement bonus until [Engineering%20%28Civ3%29](Engineering) is researched.
