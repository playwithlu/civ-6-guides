# Kazimierz Siemienowicz (Civ6)/Civilopedia

For the Polish-Lithuanian general of artillery Kazimierz Siemienowicz, there is no problem on the battlefield that can't be solved with explosives. His thoughts on rocketry and pyrotechnics are outlandish, but transformativeâ€”much to the chagrin of the various guilds, who have little good to say about Siemienowicz's 'Artis Magnae Artilleriae.'
