# Mt. Fuji (Civ5)

Mt. Fuji is a [Natural%20wonder%20%28Civ5%29](natural wonder) in "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)". It spawns in [Grassland%20%28Civ5%29](grassland) and [Mountain%20%28Civ5%29](mountain) tiles.
Strategy.
Mt. Fuji is a very useful natural wonder, providing extra {{Gold5}} and {{Culture5}} (and {{Faith5}} in "") to the [City%20%28Civ5%29](city) that works it. This can greatly expedite the acquisition of [Social%20policies%20%28Civ5%29](social policies) or the founding of a [Religion%20%28Civ5%29](religion), so empires that focus on such should stake a claim to it as soon as they are able.
