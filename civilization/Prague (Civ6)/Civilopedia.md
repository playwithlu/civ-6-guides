# Prague (Civ6)/Civilopedia

In the short time since Rudolf II moved his court to the merchant city of Prague, the eccentric Holy Roman Emperor has already transformed the city into a capital of learning and culture. Rudolf II is pleased to fund the work of renowned personages such as alchemist John Dee, astronomers Johannes Kepler and Tycho Brahe, and painter Giuseppe Arcimboldo.
