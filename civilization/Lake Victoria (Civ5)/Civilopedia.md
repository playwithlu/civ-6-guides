# Lake Victoria (Civ5)/Civilopedia

With a surface area over 26,000 square miles, Lake Victoria is the largest lake in Africa, the second largest freshwater lake on Earth, and the largest tropical lake in the world. Two large rivers leave the lake, the White Nile and the Katonga. The first historical records of the lake come from Arab traders seeking gold, ivory and other commodities from the natives as they pushed inland from the coast. The search by European explorers for the source of the Nile led to the discovery of the lake by the Englishman John Speke in 1858 AD, who named it after the then British monarch.
