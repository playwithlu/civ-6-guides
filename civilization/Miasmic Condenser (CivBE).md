# Miasmic Condenser (CivBE)

Strategy.
The Miasmic Condenser is a product of advanced ecological scientific research. While it turned out to be relatively easy to disperse the alien substance known as 'miasma', it turns out that this process can be effectively reversed. This satellite achieves this, spreading Miasma to tiles around its position (again, starting from the central tile and continuing outwards). 
This is very useful for Harmony-oriented players, who have learned to thrive in miasma, instead of being damaged by it. They can not only use the alien substance to boost their own combat strength, but also to directly damage enemy units! When preparing to attack an enemy position, launch a Miasmic condenser right above it to get the upper hand.
