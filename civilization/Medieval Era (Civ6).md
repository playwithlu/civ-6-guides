# Medieval Era (Civ6)

The Medieval Era is the third [Era%20%28Civ6%29](era) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is preceded by the [Classical%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Classical Era) and followed by the [Renaissance%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Renaissance Era).
Intro.
 You have built great cities of stone and seen early empires rise and fall. Soon you will stand under the towering pinnacles of castles alongside your gallant knights. That is where the story of your people will be written. Just as the young apprentice learns to carry a sword, so shall you grow to understand your place in this world.
Game Info.
This is the era when things start getting serious: you've established your empire, you've found your religion (or not), but the land is getting scarce. Since everyone has been expanding in the first two eras, your landmass should be more or less taken already and divided between the different civilizations on it. If anyone wants to expand further at this point, it will have to be through war! Or, you could always rush [Cartography%20%28Civ6%29](Cartography) at this point and start exploring and settling on nearby islands or continents. If your civilization isn't landlocked, that is.
The end of the Era brings about the first Tier II government - [Monarchy%20%28Civ6%29](Monarchy), with its setup which offers both military and diplomatic might! Use it as stepping stone to start expanding your empire; and if you're not a particularly aggressive player, you can always change it later. 
Religiously-oriented players should start earnestly spreading their religion in this Era. It is of course too early to progress towards a Culture or Science victory, but players aiming at those should prepare their groundwork and build multiple [Theater%20Square%20%28Civ6%29](Theater Squares) or [Campus%20%28Civ6%29](Campuses).
