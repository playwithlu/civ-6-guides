# FreeCol bug tracker

A [bug%20tracker](bug tracker) is a list of reports of [bug](bug)s in a particular project. 
The [FreeCol](FreeCol) tracker is hosted on [SourceForge](SourceForge) along with most other FreeCol material. Its main menu has three items: "Add new artifact" (where registered site members go to report a newly discovered bug), "Browse" (listing links to all bug reports and tabulating some details such as relevant dates and names), and "Reporting" (where registered members of the FreeCol project can do things).
