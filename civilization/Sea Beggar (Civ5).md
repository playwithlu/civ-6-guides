Game Info.
[Unique%20unit%20%28Civ5%29](Unique) naval unit of the [Dutch%20%28Civ5%29](Dutch) [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilization). Replaces the [Privateer%20%28Civ5%29](Privateer).
Strategy.
The Sea Beggar is a special Dutch pirate ship that is more powerful against [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities) than the normal Privateer. It is also able to Heal anywhere, allowing it to stay powerful throughout its voyages. If you build these ships in a city with an [Armory%20%28Civ5%29](Armory) (30 [XP](XP)), you can give them the Coastal Raider III and Logistics [Promotions%20%28Civ5%29](promotions) immediately. This raises the attack power of your Sea Beggars to 50 against cities, while allowing them to attack twice per turn!
With these units, a bold Dutch player can conquer enemy [Coastal%20%28Civ5%29](coastal) cities and even defeat enemy fleets by turning their own ships against them! And because all of their unique traits are simply promotions, Sea Beggars are very future proof!
