# Javelin Thrower (Civ3)

The Javelin Thrower is the unique unit for the [Mayan%20%28Civ3%29](Maya). It replaces the [Archer%20%28Civ3%29](Archer).
The Mayan Javelin Thrower hurls javelins in rapid succession, using the atl-atl. He is strong on both the attack and on the defense. The Javelin Thrower also possesses the ability to "[enslavement](enslave)". When the javelin thrower wins a battle, there is a 1/3 chance that the defeated unit will be "enslaved" and immediately turned into a [Worker%20%28Civ3%29](Worker), which is then the property of the Maya.
