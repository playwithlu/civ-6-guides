By the latter half of 1944 the Japanese war machine was already in dire straits. Most of the skilled aircrews with which it had so eventfully begun the war with were now dead, victims of a highly successful war of attrition waged by the Allied powers. Japan was desperately determined to defend her shrinking empire, however, especially her home islands. Out of desperation grew the idea of piloting an explosive-filled plane (called a
kamikaze) directly into an Allied naval vessel -- guided by a brave airman that
needed only know the rudiments of flying. Since every good Japanese soldier was already prepared to give his
life for the Emperor, finding the dedicated pilots was not a significant problem. By final tally, over 2,250
kamikaze attacks claimed about 5,000 Allied killed and 10,000 wounded.
