# CivWorld

Sid Meier's Civilization World (called Civilization World or CivWorld for short) was a [Facebook](Facebook) [MMOG](MMOG).
As in other games in the [Civilization%20%28series%29]("Civilization" series), in each game the player progresses from the Stone Age to the Space Age. This time, however, each player is not a separate [Civilizations](civilization), but instead each Civilization comprises various player [Nation%20%28CivWorld%29](Nations). It is the Civilizations, and not individual players, that compete in four categories: Culture, Economics, Domination and Technology.
Civilizations.
By default, new players are not members of any civilization, and start out as independent Nations. In "CivWorld", there are 16 civilizations available to the players:
The civilizations are the major competitors in the game, each of which can comprise more than one Nation (player). Once a player has founded a civilization, any other player can join it. For game balance reasons, the maximum number of players in a given civilization cannot be higher than 20% of total players in the game. If a civilization is full, you need to find another one to join.
Independent players cannot be attacked, but they also cannot unlock most of the [Achievements%20%28CivWorld%29](achievements) nor have access to [Civic%20%28CivWorld%29](Civics) and [Wonder%20%28CivWorld%29](Wonders). A player can leave a civilization and become independent again, free to join another one.
Eras.
The game is divided into a number of [Era](Era)s:
"Civilization Network".
"CivWorld" was originally known as Civilization Network in February 2010:
"Civilization Network" is an online [multiplayer](multiplayer) game (MMOG) developed by acclaimed game developer [Sid%20Meier](Sid Meier) and [Firaxis%20Games](Firaxis), set to launch in 2010 on Facebook. Game development is still in progress and there are rumours of an open of the game. According to , the first version "isn't expected to hit until sometime in June 2010".
"Civilization Network" will be the latest contribution to the "Civilization" game series, which began with [Sid%20Meier%27s%20Civilization](the first game) released in 1991.
In the initial announcement on Facebook, Sid Meier said:
"Civilization Network" will allow you to join together with your friends to create the world’s most powerful, richest, smartest, or just plain coolest civilization. You can coordinate your strategy to win great battles, share your technology to jump ahead of your rivals, lobby your family and friends to form your own [government](government) and win vital elections, manage and grow your [City](cities) to maximize [production](production) and [happiness](happiness), spy on your enemies, and work with your friends to create the great Wonders of the World. The game will offer everything you enjoy in "Civ" in a fully persistent environment - you can play as much as you like, whenever you like, and it’ll be free to play."
Games on Facebook are usually financed by advertisements and players who pay for extra credits or energy units. Whether "Civilization Network" will use either of those methods to make a profit has not yet been announced.
Fate.
On February 28, 2013, it was announced that May 29, 2013 would be the last day of play for "CivWorld". The game's servers shut down on that day, and it has since been replaced by the iOS version of "[Civilization%20Revolution](Civilization Revolution)". A (broken) link to the wiki that used to be associated with the game is still shown on Facebook for former players.
