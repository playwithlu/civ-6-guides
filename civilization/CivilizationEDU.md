# CivilizationEDU

CivilizationEDU is a modified version of "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)" developed by GlassLab in partnership with [Take-Two%20Interactive](Take-Two Interactive). Intended to be used in the classroom as an education tool to examine the interaction between military, technology, political, and socioeconomic issues, it became available for download in late 2016 with plans to introduce it to schools in the fall of 2017.
On December 18, 2018, GlassLab suspended its service and transitioned to LRNG.
