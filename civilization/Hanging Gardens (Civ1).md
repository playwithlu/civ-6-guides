The Hanging Gardens of Babylon are believed to have been a series of ascending, tiered gardens built within the palace to please a queen from a more verdant region. The gardens contained all manner of trees, shrubs, and vines, and appeared to be a large green mountain in a city built of sun-dried mud bricks. Pleasing to look at, cool to linger in, and a remarkable piece of engineering, the gardens were a distinctive feature of Babylon. They were written about by many visitors and were a great source of pride to the people.
