# Temple (Civ5)/Civilopedia

A temple is a religious building where the faithful can come together to worship. Such buildings show that a community is fairly wealthy as well as pious, since it can afford to construct a special structure and feed and clothe the priests, acolytes, vestal virgins, or monks within. In many early cultures each family would have a small shrine in their own dwelling; the oldest known separate temple dates from the 10th millennium BC and is located in southeastern Turkey.
