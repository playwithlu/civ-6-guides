# Charismatic Leader (Civ6)

Charismatic Leader is a Diplomatic [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
Charismatic Leader is one of the first Diplomatic Policy Cards in the game, which conveniently becomes available right when you unlock access to the first group of more advanced [Government%20%28Civ6%29](governments) that have the relevant slots. It is suitable as a "permanent" Diplomatic Policy all the way until [Machiavellianism%20%28Civ6%29](Machiavellianism) becomes available, because it will considerably speed up your production at all times and circumstances, which in turn will permit you much greater influence with [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-states). In fact, you may keep using it well into the late game, when it will finally become [obsolete](obsolete). After all, charisma works equally well with the uncouth upstarts from early nations and experienced diplomats from mature [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations)!
