# Musket Infantry (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Musket infantry of the Napoleonic era were armed with a muzzle-loading, smoothbore musket that fired a round lead ball
approximately one-half inch in diameter. The soldiers were grouped in massed formations to maximize the firepower of
the relatively short-ranged weapons and for easier control of the formation on the field of battle. As a general rule,
most armies of the time used a "battleline" composed of two ranks (parallel lines) of infantry. Although rifled muskets
had been recently invented (and were in used in limited numbers by some armies), Napoleon opted not to use them due to
their longer reload times.
