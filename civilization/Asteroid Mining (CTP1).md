# Asteroid Mining (CTP1)

Asteroid Mining is an advance in "".
Summary.
As manufacturing improved, cities created robotic drones to mine the Moon and the asteroid belt. With their newfound material wealth, the Space Colonies created food modules for food, advanced assembly bays for production and the Star Cruiser and Swarm to speed their newfound might.
Great Library entry.
For space farming and for large space fleets, Space Colonies required materials harnessed from any source other than Earth. The moon supplied materials at 3% of Earth costs, but dependence on one supplier left colonies vulnerable. By the late 21st and 22nd centuries, colonies had adapted intelligent robot vehicles to mine the stars. These robots traveled into the asteroid belt and flung asteroids back to the colonies at a steady rate. Using hollowed asteroids as a foundation, Cities created large orbital farms, capable of supporting thousands. The iron and other metals mined became the backbone of two new classes of warship, the Star Cruiser and the Space Bomber.
