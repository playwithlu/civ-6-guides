# Terrain (Civ4)

Terrain is "the physical features of a tract of land." In "[Civilization%20IV](Civilization IV)", each [Tile%20%28Civ4%29](tile) has one base terrain type, may or may not have [Hill%20%28Civ4%29](hills), and may also have one or more terrain features. Together, these are the tile's terrain, and they are assumed to cover it uniformly. Terrain has a strong effect on the [movement](movement) and [combat](combat) of [land%20unit](land unit)s.
Features of water are also called terrain for our purposes, even though the English parallel to "terrain" would be "marine." Terrain also affects naval combat, although it is far less complex there.
Land Terrain.
Base Terrain.
There are five base land terrain types. All require 1 movement point to enter. All land terrain tiles, with the exception of Ice, gain +1 bonus [Commerce%20%28Civ4%29](Commerce) if adjacent to a river.
Rivers.
Rivers are exceptional terrain in that they are not "in" or "on" a tile, but they run "between" tiles. A river is considered adjacent to all tiles that it runs along, including all four tiles which touch a place where the river bends or empties into water. However, the two tiles which touch the source of a river and are "behind" it, with respect to the river's flow, are "not" riverside. Rivers supply [Fresh%20water%20%28Civ4%29](fresh water) to all adjacent tiles. A river adds +1 Commerce to all adjacent land tiles, unless they also contain an unimproved forest or jungle. Only riverside Cities may build [Levee%20%28Civ4%29](Levees), which provide +1 Production to every riverside tile within that City's radius.
Vertical Terrain.
Hills are a sort of terrain feature, but they are not removable and thus in their own class. When a land tile has no hill, and is not a peak, it is flatland. See the [Hill%20%28Civ4%29](Hill) page for a bit more detail.
Terrain Features.
Terrain features are considered removable by "Civilization IV". Many can be removed by [Worker%20%28Civ4%29](Workers), but all features are removed when you build a city. Thus, if you build a city on a floodplain, the floodplain is removed and only desert is left.
Note that when scrubbing (clearing) fallout from a tile, any surviving improvements and/or terrain features on that tile will be also removed, though some of the former may then be rebuilt afterwards. You will not be able to rebuild an improvement that requires a particular terrain feature that has been removed by the cleanup (or else already destroyed in the nuclear attack), e.g. a [Lumbermill%20%28Civ4%29](Lumbermill) or [Forest%20Preserve%20%28Civ4%29](Forest Preserve) that had been placed on a now lost Forest.
Water Terrain.
Base Terrain.
A lake is any body of water smaller than a particular size in tiles, which is moddable but normally 9 tiles. Even though all water tiles benefit from the +1 from [Lighthouse%20%28Civ4%29](Lighthouses), being adjacent to a lake is not sufficient for a city to be coastal, which is required to build a Lighthouse.
Terrain Features.
Ice is a feature of water, although, unlike land features, it cannot be removed.
