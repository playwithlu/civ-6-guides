# Rifleman (Civ5)

Game Info.
Strong, front-line unit of the [Industrial%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Industrial Era). Upgrades from the [Musketman%20%28Civ5%29](Musketman) (and the [Longswordsman%20%28Civ5%29](Longswordsman) in [vanilla](vanilla) "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)" only).
Strategy.
The Rifleman is the result of a significant upgrade in small firearms technology during the late [Renaissance%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Renaissance)/early Industrial Era. The invention of new loading systems allows a unit to shoot many more bullets per minute than with earlier weapons, and a new design of the barrel of the gun gives its projectile a much greater boring force. The soldiers that use these new rifles are substantially more powerful than Musketmen, giving the army of a [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilization) with Riflemen a big advantage over armies that don't have them yet.
Still, like earlier infantry units, the Riflemen remain vulnerable against ranged barrages, as well as hit-and-run cavalry attacks.
