# Collectivism (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Traditionally the opposite political-philosophical pole from individualism, collectivism emphasizes shared labor and property and identity with an ingroup. It can be hierarchical (where individuals are praised in terms of their ability to fit within the hierarchy) or more lateral (where equality between individuals in the group is emphasized). Various collectivist economic and social experiments have been conducted through the ages, with varying degrees of success. The forced collectivization of Soviet farms during the 1920s was an unmitigated disaster. The ubuntu theology movement of South Africa informed that countryâ€™s Truth and Reconciliation Committee and the dismantling of the Apartheid system. The advantages and perils of collective action are still hotly debated, and likely will be for some time to come.
