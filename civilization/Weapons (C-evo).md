# Weapons (C-evo)

An weapons [module%20%28C-evo%29](module) is the design feature of a "[C-evo](C-evo)" [unit%20%28C-evo%29](unit) that gives it attack strength.
The basic value/strength of a weapons module depends on the knowledge of relevant [technologies%20%28C-evo%29](technologies) and is proportionally reduced if the unit's [health%20%28C-evo%29](health) is below 100%. Factors that may increase strength come from [buildings%20%28C-evo%29](buildings) and [combat%20%28C-evo%29](combat) [experience%20%28C-evo%29](experience).
Players can include weapons modules in new designs, up to specified limits, depending on the [weight%20%28C-evo%29](weight) limit and (again) the knowledge of relevant [technologies%20%28C-evo%29](technologies).
