# Transcend (SMAC)

Transcends are specialist citizens in "[Sid%20Meier%27s%20Alpha%20Centauri](Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri)".
The penultimate stage of human mental evolution, transcendi provide +2 to {{LinkSMAC|Economy}}, +2 to {{LinkSMAC|Psych}}, and +4 to {{LinkSMAC|Labs}}. They require {{LinkSMAC|Secrets of Alpha Centauri}} and they never become obsolete.
