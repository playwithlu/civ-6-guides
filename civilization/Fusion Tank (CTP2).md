The fusion tank was the answer to many of the prayers of generals and military strategists across the world. Hover infantry were quickly becoming the dominant force on the battlefield, with their ability to negotiate any terrain, strike swiftly and then scatter. Conventional artillery and tanks were the only long-range, armored land assault craft available. Squadrons of hover infantry, employing hand-held anti-tank munitions, literally ran circles around the slow-moving, bulky tanks, wiped out entire armies. Employing much of the same technology that powered the hover infantry's notorious anti-gravity capabilities, scientists developed a larger-scale anti-gravity levitation and propulsion system. Unlike the hover infantry's land-based system, the fusion tank's anti-grav system enabled it to travel over shallow water, which increased the fusion tank's operating range and functional capabilities. 
The fusion tank could penetrate heavily armored and fortified targets with its high-powered pulse laser cannon, and track multiple small targets with its smaller magnetic pulse guns. It rendered conventional tanks nearly obsolete and brought an armored compliment to the hover infantry's swift strike capabilities.
