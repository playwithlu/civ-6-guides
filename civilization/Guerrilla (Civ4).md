# Guerrilla (Civ4)

Guerrilla II.
Guerrilla II is available to melee units, but guerrilla I is not. Thus, most civs cannot use the guerrilla line for their melee units. However, [Gallic%20warrior](Gallic warrior)s start with guerrilla I, and the [Celts](Celts) can also build [dun](dun)s to grant guerrilla I to other melee units.
