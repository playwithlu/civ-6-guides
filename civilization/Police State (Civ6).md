In "", Police State is removed from the game.
Strategy.
Police State is quite a useful policy for [Multiplayer%20%28Civ6%29](multiplayer) games, where humans can use their [Spy%20%28Civ6%29](Spies) for maximum destruction (e.g., [Espionage%20%28Civ6%29%23Espionage%20Missions](Recruit Partisans)), and also in [Single%20player](single-player) games when you are having trouble stopping [AI](AI) Spies.
However, the /[Loyalty%20%28Civ6%29](Loyalty) penalty (a consequence of people's frustration with being watched constantly) can cause troubles if you're running low on them. In the worst case, it could cause the same effect as Spies successfully completing aÂ Recruit Partisans mission in every [Neighborhood%20%28Civ6%29](Neighborhood) in your empire every turn. Forever.
