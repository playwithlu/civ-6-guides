Civilopedia entry.
The study of the body and healing was first developed into a science by the Greeks. Hippocrates, considered the father of Medicine, based his studies of the human body on observation and reasoning. His studies were just one of many breakthroughs that resulted from the flowering of Greek Philosophy. Though some of his beliefs were incorrect, many modern medical students take the Hippocratic Oath upon graduation, swearing to uphold his principles. Medicine and alchemy were the basis for the developing science of Chemistry.
