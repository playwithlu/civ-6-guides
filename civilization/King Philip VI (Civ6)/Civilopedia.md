# King Philip VI (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Philip VI was the first French king of the Valois dynasty, whose reign is defined by the start of the Hundred Years’ War with England. One his first acts was to suppress a rebellion in Flanders and re-seat Count Louis. His relations with Edward III of England began well, but deteriorated over the status of the Duchy of Aquitaine and whether or not Edward was Philip’s vassal. This and other matters were some of the precipitating instances of the Hundred Years’ War.
While Philip held Edward to a grinding war of raid and attrition, he held advantage due to the wealth of France, but open and decisive battle proved more favorable to the English. After the Battle of Crecy in 1346, the French nobility and their allies were so badly decimated that the Estates of France refused to pay for any more wars. The arrival of the Black Death in 1348 was every bit as destructive, and deaths included Queen Joan, his wife.
