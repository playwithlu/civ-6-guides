# Eudaimonia (SMAC)

Eudaimonia is a philosophical system that takes its name from an ancient Greek word for fulfillment and happiness. Based on economic equity made possible by [Sentient%20Econometrics%20%28SMAC%29](Sentient Econometrics) and rooted in opposition to the excesses of [The%20Will%20to%20Power%20%28SMAC%29](The Will to Power), Eudaimonia encourages each citizen to achieve happiness through striving to fulfill completely his or her potential; freedom, creativity, and individuality flourish in governments that adopt this philosophy.
