# Coal (Civ4)

Strategy.
Coal provides [Production%20%28Civ4%29](Production) to the city that works it, with +1 tile bonus yield and an additional +1 bonus with a [Mine%20%28Civ4%29](Mine).
The only unit which requires Coal is the [Ironclad%20%28Civ4%29](Ironclad). While [Coal%20Plant%20%28Civ4%29](Coal Plants) may be built without access to Coal, they will not provide any unless Coal is present in the city. Coal, along with [Oil%20%28Civ4%29](Oil) , allows [Worker%20%28Civ4%29](Workers) to build [Roads%20and%20railroads%20%28Civ4%29](railroads). Besides increasing transportation speed, railroads give +1 with [Lumbermill%20%28Civ4%29](Lumbermills), [Mine%20%28Civ4%29](Mines), and [Quarry%20%28Civ4%29](Quarries). Coal provides an additional +50% with the [Ironworks%20%28Civ4%29](Ironworks).
The [Production%20%28Civ4%29](Production) bonuses of Coal come with significant [Health%20%28Civ4%29](Unhealthiness) penalties. Coal produces +2 with [Factory%20%28Civ4%29](Factories) and +1 with [Industrial%20Park%20%28Civ4%29](Industrial Parks). When producing [Power%20%28Civ4%29](Power) , [Coal%20Plant%20%28Civ4%29](Coal Plants) (and [Shale%20Plant%20%28Civ4%29](Shale Plants)) produce +4 compared to the +2 with clean power sources. When operational, clean power sources supersede Coal Plants (and Shale Plants), thereby reducing by 2. 
While [Power%20%28Civ4%29](Power) may be provided by alternative means, and [Roads%20and%20railroads%20%28Civ4%29](railroads) may be built with [Oil%20%28Civ4%29](Oil) , the +50% bonus with the Ironworks absolutely "requires" access to Coal. If is a severe issue, it may be desirable to cut off access to Coal by trading away all Coal trade resources, or by destroying Coal [Mine%20%28Civ4%29](Mines); however, this strategy will result in the loss of the +50% Ironworks bonus.
Coal is especially attractive to the [German%20%28Civ4%29](German) player, as Coal provides double production speed when building the Factory-replacement [Assembly%20Plant%20%28Civ4%29](Assembly Plant).
Coal is also relevant to [Corporation%20%28concept%29%20%28Civ4%29](Corporations). When present in a city with [Aluminum%20Co.%20%28Civ4%29](Aluminum Co.), Coal provides +3 per Coal resource, and also provides access to within that city. When present in a city with [Mining%20Inc.%20%28Civ4%29](Mining Inc.), each Coal resources provides +1 .
