# Coast (Civ5)/Civilopedia

Coast hexes are the ocean hexes directly adjacent to land. They provide food and gold to a nearby city, but only if that civilization has the [Sailing%20%28Civ5%29](Sailing) technology. Only naval units and "[Embarkation%20%28Civ5%29](embarked)" land units may enter coastal hexes.
