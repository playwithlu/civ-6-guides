# Rogue State (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Like individuals, nations adhere to certain political norms to maintain smooth and regular functioning between each other. A nation may choose to ignore those norms to gain some advantage, and when this is done repeatedly or flagrantly, the nation is branded a “rogue state.” This often results in political isolation for the regime, but it may allow the renegade nation to get away with what it wants, as the costs of punishing the rogue state may be higher than the community of nations is willing to pay. Rogue states may be complete political pariahs, or they may have a small handful of patron nations willing to prop them up (sometimes a failed rogue state is more dangerous than a stable rogue state). The rest of the world finds them exasperating at best, and an unpleasant reminder of the fragility of diplomatic norms.
