Great Library entry.
By the 23rd century the average human life span passed one hundred years as medicine eliminated some of the effects of aging. Unfortunately many of these new centenarian suffered from dementia and senility. Cryonics, the science of life extension through freezing and resuscitation, was seen as another viable alternative to mortality. In 2210, the first successful human thaw started a stampede resulting fifty years later in the "Van Winkle" generation. (Cryonics was later widely discredited with the Miami Meltdown of 2424.)
