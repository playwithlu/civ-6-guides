# Era (Civ6)

In "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)", as in previous games in the series, an era is a broad representation of the technological and social level your [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) has currently achieved. In a normal game, you always start in the [Ancient%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Ancient Era) (in other types of games, you may start later), and you progress towards the [Information%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Information Era).
Changing eras.
In "Civilization VI", as opposed to previous games, both your civilization's scientific and cultural development will allow you to progress through the eras. The advancements of both the [List%20of%20technologies%20in%20Civ6](technology tree) and the [List%20of%20civics%20in%20Civ6](civics tree) are organized into eras, and you will enter a new era when one of two things happens:
World Eras in "Rise and Fall".
The "" expansion modifies the concept of eras by introducing the World Era. This is related to the new [Ages%20%28Civ6%29](Ages) mechanic and effectively means that a civilization can be in two eras simultaneously: the current World Era and its "Individual Era." Typically the Individual Era of a civilization is more advanced, but sometimes that's not the case; it is fully possible, for example, for the world to enter the Classical Era while your civilization is still struggling to discover the first [Technology%20%28Civ6%29](tech) or [Civic%20%28Civ6%29](civic) of that era, and remain without bridges on its roads! Remember that while Individual Eras continue changing according to the rules described above, the World Era changes centrally based on the median progress of all civilizations in the game, not just your own.
Some of the effects of changing eras are now moved from Individual Era change to World Era change. Check below for details.
