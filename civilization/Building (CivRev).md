# Building (CivRev)

A building is a permanent fixture in a [City%20%28CivRev%29](city) that provides it with various benefits. Some "[Civilization%20Revolution](Civilization Revolution)" players prefer to build vast armies and crush their enemies, but buildings are necessary for those who want their cities to flourish. Your first city in a game of "Civilization Revolution" will contain little more than a [Palace%20%28CivRev%29](Palace) (small as it may be!) and a few homes, but constructing a few buildings in it will allow it to grow into a bustling metropolis over time.
Build Time.
Constructing buildings, like all activities in "Civilization Revolution", takes time. The amount of turns varies depending on a city's production potential; it can be as few as 2-3 turns or as many as 30-45 turns. Buildings take noticeably fewer turns to be constructed than [Wonder%20%28CivRev%29](wonders), but some of the more advanced buildings can still take quite a bit of time to construct. The amount of production (or "hammers") required to construct buildings ranges from 40 (Barracks, Library, Granary, Temple) to 200 ([Factory%20%28CivRev%29](Factory)). Settling a Great Builder in a city will halve the amount of turns required for it to construct buildings.
