# Preparatory Fire (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Naval gunfire support (a type of shore bombardment known as NGFS) is the use of naval guns – from primitive mortars to modern rockets – to provide artillery support for ground troops operating near the shore. Modern NGFS is often part of the preparatory fire ("softening up") for amphibious assaults. During the 17th century, bomb vessels had two or more mortars mounted to fire explosive shells onto enemy troops on or near the shore. During the American Civil War and the Crimean War, armored monitors made an appearance, along with "floating batteries." But by World War I, the big guns of battleships, cruisers, and destroyers served better for NGFS. A practice used extensively during the many amphibious operations of the next two major wars.
