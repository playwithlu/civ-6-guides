Modern Banking arose during the Renaissance among the merchant families of the Italian city-states who were benefiting from the increase in Trade, both within Europe and with the Middle East. The wealthy merchants pooled their surplus money into a Bank, and loaned cash at interest to other commercial enterprises. The availability of this capital for investment made many new businesses possible and helped accelerate economic growth. Banking was even
more important after the Industrial Revolution due to the even larger capital investments required by the newly rising industrial Corporations.
