# Advanced Ballistics (Civ5)

Game Info.
The development of Advanced Ballistics allows creation of [Guided%20Missile%20%28Civ5%29](Guided Missiles), which in turn make possible an even deadlier WMD: the [Nuclear%20Missile%20%28Civ5%29](Nuclear Missile), which delivers the next-generation technology of death to its target.
On the more peaceful front, this technology allows the development of the first part of your Spaceship - the [SS%20booster%20%28Civ5%29](Booster) -Â starting you on the path to Technological victory.
