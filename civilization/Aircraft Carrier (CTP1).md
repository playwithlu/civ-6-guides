On August 2, 1917 British Commander E.H. Dunning piloted his Sopwith Pup to a safe landing aboard the H.M.S. Furious - the first recorded landing at sea. By World War II the aircraft carrier dominated the seas. Though the U.S. lost two Battleships at Pearl Harbor, the loss proved inconsequential to the war's outcome. Instead, victory turned on the Battle of Midway where the Japanese lost four carriers and three hundred and twenty-two planes to the Americans' single sunken carrier.
