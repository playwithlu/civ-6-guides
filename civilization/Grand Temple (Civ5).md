# Grand Temple (Civ5)

Game Info.
Religious national wonder. Requires a [Temple%20%28Civ5%29](Temple) in all [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities); must be built in a [Holy%20City%20%28Civ5%29](Holy City).
Strategy.
The Grand Temple is a fine tool for religious-oriented empires, helping them both to spread their [Religion%20%28Civ5%29](religion) and defend against other strong religions nearby. As with all national wonders, it's better build it early so its cost doesn't become prohibitive.
