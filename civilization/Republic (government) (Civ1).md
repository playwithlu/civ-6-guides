Civilopedia entry.
The "republican" form of government encourages greater economic freedom among the
people and leads to dramatic increases in trade. More trade means more
luxuries, tax revenues, and science research. However, under a republic war
is much more difficult to wage because military units not in their home city
cause one citizen to become unhappy. Most cities can therefore only afford to
have a few military units on campaign without risking civil disorder. The
republic becomes especially useful when your cities have grown quite large,
because the increase in trade is very helpful in providing luxuries and
maintaining a reasonable rate of technology advance.
Advisors are Greeks in the ancient era and Americans in the modern era. The leader is known as a President.
