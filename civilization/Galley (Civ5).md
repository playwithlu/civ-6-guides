# Galley (Civ5)

Game Info.
[Unique%20unit%20%28Civ5%29](Unique) naval melee unit of the [Barbarian%20%28Civ5%29](Barbarians). Precursor to the [Trireme%20%28Civ5%29](Trireme).
Strategy.
The Galley is a Barbarian unit which remains in [Coast%20%28Civ5%29](coast) tiles, looking for [Embarkation%20%28Civ5%29](embarked) units to destroy. It is far weaker than any other [Naval%20unit%20%28Civ5%29](naval units), but can be dangerous in packs. It is a melee attack unit, engaging units at sea or [Coastal%20%28Civ5%29](coastal) [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities) (but it has no ranged attack).
If you play as the [Ottoman%20%28Civ5%29](Ottomans), you can convert Galleys to your side by destroying Barbarian naval units early on in the game.
