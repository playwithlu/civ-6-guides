# Peacekeeping Forces (SMAC)

The Peacekeeping Forces are a [Factions%20%28SMAC%29](faction) in "[Sid%20Meier%27s%20Alpha%20Centauri](Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri)". They are led by Commissioner Pravin Lal.
Faction characteristics.
Although Lal is not restricted from using the Fundamentalist politics choice, an [AI](AI)-controlled Lal will take offense at a player's choice of such.
Leader's defining quote.
"As the Americans learned so painfully in Earth's final century, free flow of information is the only safeguard against tyranny. The once-chained people whose leaders at last loose their grip on information flow will soon burst with freedom and vitality, but the free nation gradually constricting its grip on public discourse has begun its rapid slide into despotism. Beware of he who would deny you access to information, for in his heart he dreams himself your master."
-- Commissioner Pravin Lal, "UN Declaration of Rights"
Gamer's choice.
Lal's is the faction to play if you like comparatively bigger bases. It is designed for it, with preHabitat is size 9 and preDome is size 16. If you like small base, choose Morgan.
Another factor to help his big base is the number of extra talents. With 1 per 4, each preDome base can have 4 extra talents, help quelling 4 drones, and equivalent to 2 Rec Common in drone duty. It's of immense value and a big necessity to Lal's sprawling megapolis.
Strategy.
The easiest way to win with this faction is by being elected as [Supreme%20Leader%20%28SMAC%29](Supreme Leader). The extra Talents every 4 citizen makes [Golden%20Age](Golden Age)s much easier, providing the extra +2 [GROWTH%20%28SMAC%29](GROWTH) to increase population. Since this faction can exceed [Hab%20Complex%20%28SMAC%29](Hab Complex) requirement by 2, the Peacekeepers can have bigger bases than their competitors. And with the double votes, the [Planetary%20Governor%20%28SMAC%29](Planetary Governor) and Supreme Leader positions are easily obtainable.
