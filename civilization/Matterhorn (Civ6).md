# Matterhorn (Civ6)

The Matterhorn is a single-tile impassable {{Link6|natural wonder}} in "". The Matterhorn occupies a {{Link6|Grassland}} or {{Link6|Plains}} {{Link6|tile}}, and provides +1 {{Culture6}} and +2 {{Link6|Appeal}} to each adjacent tile. Although it is considered a {{Link6|Mountain}} in-game, it does not provide an {{Link6|adjacency bonus}} to {{District6}}s.
A land [Military%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](combat unit) (except a [Warrior%20Monk%20%28Civ6%29](Warrior Monk)) that moves adjacent to the Matterhorn receives the Alpine Training ability, which grants it a permanent, one-time bonus of +3 {{Strength6}} Combat Strength when fighting on [Hills%20%28Civ6%29](Hills) tiles and allows it to traverse Hills without {{Moves6}} penalties.
Discovering the Matterhorn grants +1 [Era%20Score%20%28Civ6%29](Era Score), or +3 Score if the player is the first to do so.
Strategy.
Like other impassable wonders, the Matterhorn's tile offers no benefits, and cannot be developed or improved. However, the Matterhorn provides +1 {{Culture6}} to up to six adjacent tiles; these yields are cumulatively worth more than the dead tile early in the game. It is typically worth incorporating single-tile natural wonders within [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) [Borders%20%28Civ6%29](borders) to maximize their yields.
The Appeal bonus of the Matterhorn is also ideal for building [Neighborhood%20%28Civ6%29](Neighborhoods), and is useful when founding [National%20Park%20%28Civ6%29](National Parks).
