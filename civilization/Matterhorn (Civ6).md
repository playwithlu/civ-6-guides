Like other impassable wonders, the Matterhorn's tile offers no benefits, and cannot be developed or improved. However, the Matterhorn provides +1 to up to six adjacent tiles; these yields are cumulatively worth more than the dead tile early in the game. It is typically worth incorporating single-tile natural wonders within [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) [Borders%20%28Civ6%29](borders) to maximize their yields.
The Appeal bonus of the Matterhorn is also ideal for building [Neighborhood%20%28Civ6%29](Neighborhoods), and is useful when founding [National%20Park%20%28Civ6%29](National Parks).
