# Game mechanics (C-evo)

Game mechanics of [C-evo](C-evo), as distinct from [gameplay%20%28C-evo%29](gameplay).
Design.
AI play.
"Note: The standard AI downloadable in 2011 was still following rules that were changed in about 2008; for example, declaring war the turn after breaking a friendship instead of waiting three turns." However, version 1.2.0 (available in 2013) fixed that.
Military unit design.
One must strategically choose what qualities (for example: mobility, attack power, defense, etc.) will be built into the "units" prior to building them. Features add weight (and cost) and there is a weight limit (raised as later [advance%20%28C-evo%29](advances) are made). As a game progresses, scientific advancements and [wonder%20%28C-evo%29](wonder)s give additional unit capabilities, but with a minimum of early research advances (prerequisite [Warrior%20Code%20%28C-evo%29](Warrior Code), and desirably also [Horseback%20Riding%20%28C-evo%29](Horseback Riding) and [Bronze%20Working%20%28C-evo%29](Bronze Working)) a player will be able to construct new "units" that are better than the two pre-designed basic units.
