# Pulias (Civ5)/Civilopedia

The exact origins of Pulias are shrouded in mystery even to this day. It seems to have emerged out of nowhere, yet its power and wealth seem too large to have been easily missed. Most sources posit a single leader who saw the opportunities of new science, commerce, and most of all politics, and manipulated affairs from the shadows. This leader sold sensitive information to rivals at a premium while using it to further the objectives of Pulias. In the early competition between empires, many opportunities were left unexplored as rivals focused on short-term gains. Pulias was the first to send expeditions to foreign lands, and established trade that brought riches to its citizens. Its spies were placed in key positions across the world, gathering intelligence and ready to act.
