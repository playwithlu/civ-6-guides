# Hattusa (Civ6)

Hattusa is a scientific [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-state) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
Hattusa's unique bonus is very handy if you have a poor starting location with few [Resource%20%28Civ6%29%23Strategic](strategic resources), in which case it's going to be your only hope of getting ahead militaristically. If you are planning on a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Domination](Domination) or [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Science](Science Victory) but have few or no strategic resources, consider becoming its [Suzerain%20%28Civ6%29](Suzerain). Hattusa synergizes quite well with [James%20Young%20%28Civ6%29](James Young), as you will be able to stockpile {{Oil6}} much earlier than you normally would.
Note that a resource is considered "revealed" once you've researched the [Technology%20%28Civ6%29](technology) that causes it to appear on the [Map%20%28Civ6%29](map).
