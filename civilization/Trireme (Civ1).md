# Trireme (Civ1)

The Trireme may be lost at sea if not adjacent to land at the end of a turn. It can transport up to two other units.
Civilopedia entry.
The Greeks introduced the Trireme, the first ship designed for war. It mounted a huge bronze beak in its bow that was used to ram and sink enemy ships. The Trireme was also fast, powered by three banks of oars on each side, manned by well-trained oarsmen -- highly paid professionals or patriotic citizens, contrary to popular belief. Because of its long, narrow hull, however, the Trireme was unstable in all but the calmest waters, and as a consequence its crew never ventured out of sight of land for long, lest the ship be caught by storms.
