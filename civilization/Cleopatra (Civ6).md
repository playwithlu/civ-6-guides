# Cleopatra (Civ6)

Cleopatra VII Philopator (69 â€“ 12 August 30 BC) was the last active of . Seeking to maintain Egypt's independence at a time of increased [Rome%20%28city%29](Roman) expansionism, she aligned herself with powerful Roman generals such as [Julius%20Caesar](Julius Caesar) and , and thus became a key figure in the that led to the end of the and the start of the . She leads the [Egyptian%20%28Civ6%29](Egyptians) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Cleopatra is [Qin%20Shi%20Huang%20%28Civ6%29](Qin Shi Huang's) main competitor in the [Wonder%20%28Civ6%29](wonder) race; however, instead of a [Great%20Wall%20%28Civ6%29](Great Wall) to hide behind, she uses her charm (and trade benefits) to encourage her powerful friends to attack on her behalf.
This is the standard version of Cleopatra when players do not have the [Rulers%20of%20the%20Sahara%20Pack%20%28Civ6%29](Rulers of the Sahara Pack) enabled. When it is enabled, Cleopatra will be split into two alternate [Persona%20%28Civ6%29](personas): [Cleopatra%20%28Civ6%29/Ptolemaic](Ptolemaic Cleopatra), with a new appearance and abilities; and Egyptian Cleopatra, using her former model and abilities.
Intro.
 There will be those who underestimate you, but you are cunning and full of tricks, Queen Cleopatra. Your charm will establish indestructible alliances with the strongest leaders of the world. Keep your friends close by your side and you will find yourself untouchable, with the glory of Egypt primed to win over the world.
In-Game.
Cleopatra's unique [Agenda%20%28Civ6%29](agenda) is Queen of the Nile. She likes [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) with a strong military and dislikes civilizations with a weaker military.
Her [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader ability) is Mediterranean's Bride. It gives +4 to international s sent from Egypt. Other civilizations' s to Egypt provide +2 to them and +2 for Egypt. In "", she also earns double Alliance Points for trading with her allies.
Detailed Approach.
Egypt starts right along a [River%20%28Civ6%29](River) where they get bonuses for building [District%20%28Civ6%29](districts) and wonders. Those wonders become especially valuable with [Sphinx%20%28Civ6%29](Sphinxes) nearby, allowing Egypt to get off to a speedy start in all areas of the game. If Cleopatra can then befriend the other powerful civilizations (perhaps because they are getting from trading with her) she will be able to continue to move forward with wonders. This will set her up to push toward any victory type, though with both wonders and Sphinxes, she is especially strong playing for a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Culture Victory).
Lines.
Cleopatra is voiced by [Nirvana%20Hisham](Nirvana Hisham). She speaks (with modern Egyptological pronunciation ignoring the original vowels, rather than a reconstructed pronunciation of the language), the best-documented stage of the ancient Egyptian language, which was anachronistically used between 2000 and 1300 BC. Realistically, she would have spoken , her native language and the official language of Ptolemaic Egypt's courts. She was also fluent in , the form of Egyptian used during the 1st century BC.
