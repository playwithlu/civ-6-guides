# Field Dynamics Lab (CTP2)

Field Dynamics is a [Wonder%20%28CTP2%29](Wonder) in "[Call%20to%20Power%20II](Call to Power II)". It costs 15,200 production points to build.
Gameplay.
The Field Dynamics Laboratory represents the zenith of scientific achievement. It becomes the center of breakthrough research and increases throughout the host empire.
Great Library entry.
In 2034, after the discovery of high temperature superconductors, scientists at Stockholm-based Lemur Systems, Ltd. began constructing a research facility for the study of Chaos Theory, Unified Field Theory and Fusion Power. Once the Field Dynamics Laboratory was finished in 2036, the Swedish scientific community began to accelerate their research progress at a rate substantially higher than their rivals. It utilized superconductors for highly sensitive diagnostic and monitoring equipment, as well as in experimental fusion reactors. They attempted to employ high temperature superconductors to create magnetic fields sufficiently strong enough to confine ionized gasses in the reactor. Their research put them ahead of the pack and led to the eventual discovery of Fusion.
