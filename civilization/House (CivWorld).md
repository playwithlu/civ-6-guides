# House (CivWorld)

The House is a [Building%20%28CivWorld%29](building) in "[CivWorld](CivWorld)".
Strategy.
Houses are used to obtain [Resource%20%28CivWorld%29](resources) and require 100 production to build. Houses can be set to be used by 5 different types of citizens, Farmers, Workers, Scientists, Artists, and Merchants. Each House needs one population to be able to work; otherwise, it will become an abandoned house. Where the House is placed decides the happiness and the productivity of the citizens living there (certain buildings and [Civic%20%28CivWorld%29](Civics) will also change happiness and productivity). As a House increases its productivity it will grow in size.
