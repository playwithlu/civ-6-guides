# Military Academy (Civ6)

The Military Academy is an advanced military [Building%20%28Civ6%29](building) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is built in the [Encampment%20%28Civ6%29](Encampment) [District%20%28Civ6%29](district) and requires an [Armory%20%28Civ6%29](Armory) (or one of its replacements).
Strategy.
The ultimate military building in the game, the Military Academy has one very interesting special effect: it allows its parent city to train land units as Corps or Armies. The word "faster" in the description means that the training process will take less than it otherwise would to train 2 or 3 of the respective units. And for someone who needs to produce a strong army quickly, this can mean the difference between survival and the end of the game!
The [Experience%20%28Civ6%29](experience) boost applies to [Nihang%20%28Civ6%29](Nihang), but not to [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Recon](recon units) or [Warrior%20Monk%20%28Civ6%29](Warrior Monks).
Building three Military Academies triggers the for [Totalitarianism%20%28Civ6%29](Totalitarianism).
