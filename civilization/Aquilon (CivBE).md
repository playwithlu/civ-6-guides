# Aquilon (CivBE)

Game info.
The Aquilon is a Supremacy - Harmony ultimate hybrid support unit. It is a synthetic life form that has [Floatstone%20%28CivBE%29](Floatstone) embedded in its internal tissues and is grafted to an aircraft carrier chassis, allowing for amphibious transportation of aircraft. Unlike a standard [Carrier%20%28CivBE%29](aircraft carrier), the Aquilon comes equipped with an onboard plasma-cannon, allowing for it to assume the role of a levitating gunship.
Unit Upgrades.
Tier 1.
Aquilons can be used in the mid game if Biometallurgy is rushed, but generally it will appear in the late game. The Aquilon itself is a decent alternative to Missile Rovers as it is far more durable, although its main prospect is that it can Hover, and it can also carry aircraft on land, being the only unit being able to do so. While it can only hold 1 Tacjet at Tier 1, this is still very useful as not many cities will be prepared for aerial assault. Be sure to use these to surprise the enemy and provide support to your team.
Tier 2.
Tier 2 Aquilons are more useful than their Tier 1 counterparts. They can either become dedicated amphibious carriers by carrying up to 2 aircraft, or only carry one but instead receive additional attack bonuses. Their Ranged Strength is quite high, and their Strength is durable enough for a backline unit, so they have a lot of potential to be used as siege units.
