# Public Works (Civ6)

Public Works is an Economic [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
Public Works combines the effects of [Ilkum%20%28Civ6%29](Ilkum) and [Serfdom%20%28Civ6%29](Serfdom) into a single policy. [Builder%20%28Civ6%29](Builders) can start planting [Woods%20%28Civ6%29](Woods) and creating [Seaside%20Resort%20%28Civ6%29](Seaside Resorts) shortly after it becomes available, so it will prove most useful to players focused on a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Cultural Victory). As with Ilkum and Serfdom, it is useful only as long as you produce Builders.
