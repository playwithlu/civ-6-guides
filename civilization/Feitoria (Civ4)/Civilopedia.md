# Feitoria (Civ4)/Civilopedia

The Feitoria is a Portuguese trading post. During the colonial era Feitorias were essential to the Portuguese in expanding their trade network between Europe, the Far East, and eventually the Americas. They afforded ships with limited range a safe port of call to refill depleted supplies and give their crews much needed rest.
