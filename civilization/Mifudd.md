# Mifudd

In 2009, several maps for [C-evo](C-evo) were designed and published by a contributor named "mifudd".
They came with the following comments:
"Hello Guys, I have designt some maps. On most of the maps the human player has a good starting point: The human position lies on a bridge point between several enemys, and he has a little continent for settlement. On some maps are additional ressources added. Must See! Mike PS: On some maps the location of cities is marked with a placed road. "
By mid-2017, the maps had had over 6,400 downloads and been voted two-and-a-half out of three stars for value.
All may be downloaded from the C-evo website and are listed at [Map%20%28C-evo%29](Map (C-evo)) with links to individual articles about some of them.
