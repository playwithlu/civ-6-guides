# Warrior Monk (Civ6)

The Warrior Monk is a [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Warrior%20Monk](special unit) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)", introduced in the [Civilization%20VI%20Fall%202017%20Update](Fall 2017 Update). It can only be purchased with in a [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) that has a majority [Religion%20%28Civ6%29](religion) and a [Holy%20Site%20%28Civ6%29](Holy Site) with a [Temple%20%28Civ6%29](Temple) (or one of its replacements).
Strategy.
The Warrior Monk is a [Military%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](military unit) with its own special set of s: [Cobra%20Strike%20%28Civ6%29](Cobra Strike), [Dancing%20Crane%20%28Civ6%29](Dancing Crane), [Disciples%20%28Civ6%29](Disciples), [Exploding%20Palms%20%28Civ6%29](Exploding Palms), [Shadow%20Strike%20%28Civ6%29](Shadow Strike), [Sweeping%20Wind%20%28Civ6%29](Sweeping Wind), and [Twilight%20Veil%20%28Civ6%29](Twilight Veil). A fully promoted Warrior Monk will have 65 Combat Strength and 4 , be able to attack twice per turn with double [Flanking%20and%20Support%20%28Civ6%29](flanking bonuses), be invisible to non-adjacent enemy units, and spread its [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization's) religion to cities within 10 [hex](hex)es each time it defeats a non-[Barbarian%20%28Civ6%29](Barbarian) unit.
There are, however, a number of factors that make the odds of a Warrior Monk earning all of these s rather slim. The timing of this unit is very poor, rendering its presence in battle a rare sight; a domination-religious strategy that heavily involves Warrior Monks is unheard of. Practically, you can get the Warrior Monks Follower Belief when you found your religion, but you cannot purchase the unit until you have a Temple, which is unlocked with [Theology%20%28Civ6%29](Theology). Considering that output naturally outpaces output in the first two [Era%20%28Civ6%29](eras), Theology has a lot more prerequisites than [Iron%20Working%20%28Civ6%29](Iron Working), and the s leading to Theology are so much harder to trigger than s leading to Iron Working, unlocking Theology before other civilizations have access to [Swordsman%20%28Civ6%29](Swordsmen) is impossible, so the landscape of the game is always against the Warrior Monks.
In "", any Warrior Monk purchased in a city to which [Moksha%20%28Cardinal%29%20%28Civ6%29](Moksha) has been assigned after earning the [Patron%20Saint%20%28Civ6%29](Patron Saint) title will receive a free , but even that does not save this unit. Other [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Melee](melee units) can fight and earn [XP](XP) from the beginning of the game, have unique bonuses and [Building%20%28Civ6%29](buildings) to boost their XP gain, and have Tier I s that enhance their sturdiness or damage output in battle, whereas the Warrior Monk has none. Buying just 2 Warrior Monks means you have to pass up roughly 4 [Missionary%20%28Civ6%29](Missionaries) (they have scaling cost) or an [Apostle%20%28Civ6%29](Apostle), both of which are more useful than a unit that is so weak in battle without s. Overall, there are always better Follower Beliefs to choose and many other better ways to invest your .
Although they are melee attackers, Warrior Monks are not classified as melee units. They don't benefit from [Battering%20Ram%20%28Civ6%29](Battering Rams), [Siege%20Tower%20%28Civ6%29](Siege Towers), or [Akkad%20%28Civ6%29](Akkad's) [Suzerain%20%28Civ6%29](Suzerain) bonus, receive neither Combat Strength modifiers from [Fascism%20%28Civ6%29](Fascism), [Digital%20Democracy%20%28Civ6%29](Digital Democracy), and [Ambiorix%20%28Civ6%29](Ambiorix's) [List%20of%20leader%20abilities%20in%20Civ6](leader ability) nor bonus XP from [Encampment%20%28Civ6%29](Encampment) buildings, and aren't boosted by [Great%20General%20%28Civ6%29](Great Generals) of any era. They do, however, receive the bonuses from [Oligarchy%20%28Civ6%29](Oligarchy), [Comandante%20General%20%28Civ6%29](Comandantes Generales), and [Mongolian%20%28Civ6%29](Mongolia's) [List%20of%20civilization%20abilities%20in%20Civ6](civilization ability).
Bugs.
Unlike [Vampire%20%28Civ6%29](Vampires) and [Nihang%20%28Civ6%29](Nihang), Warrior Monks don't belong to CLASS_ALL_ERAS which is why they aren't affected by Great Generals.
