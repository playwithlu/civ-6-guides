# Global warming (Civ1)

Global warming occurs when [Pollution%20%28Civ1%29](Pollution) is allowed to stay on the [Map%20%28Civ1%29](map), beginning in the Industrial age. It can affect the world by turning [Plains%20%28Civ1%29](Plains) into [Desert%20%28Civ1%29](Deserts). Global warming can be avoided by building [Mass%20Transit%20%28Civ1%29](Mass Transit), [Recycling%20Center%20%28Civ1%29](Recycling Centers), and more environmentally friendly power plants. If there is a mass nuclear exchange, the resulting pollution will speed up Global warming incredibly, turning the world into a desert.
Stages.
There are four stages, each stage taking several turns.
If there is still pollution on the map at the end of the fourth stage, some [Plains%20%28Civ1%29](Plains) squares will become [Desert%20%28Civ1%29](Desert), or some coastal squares will turn into [Swamp%20%28Civ1%29](Swamp). The stages are then reset, and the cycle begins again.
