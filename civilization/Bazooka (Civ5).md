# Bazooka (Civ5)

Game Info.
Advanced ranged unit of the [Atomic%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Atomic Era). Upgrades from the [Machine%20Gun%20%28Civ5%29](Machine Gun).
Strategy.
The Bazooka - an infantry unit armed with shoulder-launched rockets - is introduced in "" as the ultimate ranged weapon. They trade some of the multipurpose use of infantry for the ability to deliver devastating damage to nearby units without retaliation. Their rockets are effective against pretty much any sort of infantry or armored units, and they're equally good on the defensive. Use Bazookas alongside your infantry to deal damage on the front lines without suffering damage.
Note that in spite of its real-life use as an anti-tank weapon, the in-game Bazooka has no anti-armor bonuses.
