# Intelligence Operations (Civ3)/Civilopedia

The Byzantine Empire, beset on all sides by enemies that coveted their wealth, was not always able to field armies
everywhere that there might be an attack. To aid them in the task of defending their far-flung empire, the Byzantines
developed an extensive spy network. These early intelligence officers allowed the Byzantines to discover troop strengths and
locations, keep track of what was going on in the capitals and most important cities of their enemies, bribe tribes and
empires not to attack them and make small attacks on vital installations and infrastructure far from the main armed forces of the
Empire.
