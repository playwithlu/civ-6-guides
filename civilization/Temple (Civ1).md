# Temple (Civ1)

The Temple is the first building available to help counter unhappiness.
Civilopedia entry.
In ancient times, nearly every city had a Temple consecrated to its own god, as well as those dedicated to other deities. But although today Temples and churches are places of worship, to the Greeks, Romans, and others, Temples were perceived primarily as dwelling places for their respective gods and goddesses. Here the deity was honored and revered, and here the faithful brought gifts of food, rare metals, and spices. Having a Temples in their city comforted the people, and the wise ruler often invested in Temples as soon as a city began to grow.
