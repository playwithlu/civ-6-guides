Fusion is an [List%20of%20advances%20in%20CTP1](advance) in "".
Summary.
Building on theories of [Unified%20Physics%20%28CTP1%29](Unified Physics), Fusion offers a clean, unlimited power source. [Fusion%20Plant%20%28CTP1%29](Fusion Plants) aid grossly [Pollution%20%28CTP1%29](polluting) [City%20%28CTP1%29](cities), and, in smaller, mobile forms, Fusion powers the grand [Leviathan%20%28CTP1%29](Leviathan), king of all warfare, and its side-kick, the swift but deadly [Fusion%20Tank%20%28CTP1%29](Fusion Tank).
Great Library entry.
Although early fusion experiments in the 20th century looked promising, the work proved unfounded and ended fruitlessly. Not until the grand discovery of the Unified Physics Theory did scientists understand their errors and create the first Fusion reactor, a device of limitless clean energy.
