Gameplay.
By reclaiming and purifying water on a massive scale, the Aqua-Filters can offset the considerable levels of waste a large city produces and bring clean water to anyone who needs it. Aqua-Filters reduce and make city expansion possible.
Great Library entry.
The development of nanotechnology introduced several new ways to dramatically reduce pollution. The Aqua Filter, invented in the late 21st century, utilized two basic nano-machine types in order to meet the demands of increasingly larger cities for clean, fresh water. It filtered sewage and agricultural runoff with nanite "scrubbers" that extracted pure water from the waste. In addition, it deployed nanites into parts of the water supply, which searched for impurities, harmful chemicals and waste products and eliminated them. This made the city's water supply vastly more reusable, making water available to more people without depleting natural sources of water.
