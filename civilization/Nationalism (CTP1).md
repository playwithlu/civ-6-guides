The development of Nationalism marked an important shift in the way people viewed their own participation in political affairs around the world. Since ancient times, people had generally identified themselves with a particular city, region, or ethnic group. It wasn't until the late Renaissance period that Europeans began to formulate the concept of a 'Wation," a political domain not necessarily defined by proximity or ethnicity.

In modern times, Nationalism is often synonymous with extremism. Governments
