Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the world depended on petroleum products as its primary source of fuel. The effect on the environment was measurable, with emissions of harmful gasses contributing to the greenhouse effect, which caused bizarre weather patterns and a general rise in the mean temperature of the earth. With the development of fuel cells in the early 21st century, ecologically friendly fuel sources enabled manufacturers of power systems to rid themselves of the burden of fossil fuels. Substantially cleaner than gasoline, coal or oil and more powerful than solar energy, fuel cells finally gave the world a reprieve from air pollution.
