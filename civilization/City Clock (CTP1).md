The mechanical clock was developed in China before appearing in Europe in the 13th century. By 1370, Charles V of France ordered all church bells to be rung at the sound of his new clock, setting the "King's hour"for the first time. Gates opened and closed to the new time, and work began and ended with the chimes. Historical accounts support the powerful effect of the new clocks which soon appeared in Cities throughout Europe.
