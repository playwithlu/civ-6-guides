# Winged Hussar (Civ5)/Civilopedia

The "winged" type of hussar was introduced into the Polish-Lithuanian military by King Stephen Bathory in the 1570s. Winged hussars generally carried a number of secondary weapons, usually a warhammer, a szabla saber, and one or two wheellock (later flintlock) pistols in saddle holsters. But their most distinctive accoutrement was the huge "wings," wooden frames attached to either the saddle or the rider's shoulders, covered with eagle, swan, goose or ostrich feathers. The purpose of the wings has never been definitely determined, but theories range from defense against enemy attacks from behind to making their own horse deaf to battle sounds, to intimidating enemy foot soldiers by making the hussars appear larger than normal men.
