# Jet Propulsion (CTP1)

Jet Propulsion is an advance in "".
Summary.
With Jet Propulsion, the third Flight Advance, Civilizations refine and perfect flight. With more powerful engines and advanced airframes, Interceptors and Bombers achieve supersonic speeds and intercontinental ranges. In addition, the Paratrooper can be dropped from swift transports to strike across oceans. Meanwhile, Radar Stations detect enemy units far before they come into visual range.
Great Library entry.
The jet lifted the airplane into a new era of power and reliability. With the jet engine, passenger planes crossed the Atlantic in less than twelve hours, and combat aircraft crossed the sound barrier for the first time. These high speeds demanded new airframes. The U.S. X-plane program tested new designs in construction and propulsion. These tests contributed significantly to the American Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo projects, helping to make space flight possible.
