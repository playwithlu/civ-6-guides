# Free Colonists (Col)

A Free Colonist is the generic civilian/worker unit in "[Sid%20Meier%27s%20Colonization](Sid Meier's Colonization)". It has no special skills. It may perform any duty without any special bonuses or penalties.
A Free Colonist may learn skills, which will convert it into a specialist unit. For example, if the Free Colonist is equipped as a [Soldiers%20%28Col%29](Soldiers) or [Dragoons%20%28Col%29](Dragoons) and wins a battle, it has a chance to be upgraded to a [Veteran%20Soldiers%20%28Col%29](Veteran Soldiers). A Free Colonist performing an outdoor labor has a chance of spontaneously becoming an expert in that job (the chance increases each turn the colonist continues performing the same task without switching).
If you prefer a bit less randomness in your skills, a Free Colonist may learn a skill by visiting an [Indians%20%28Col%29](Indian tribe). Only the first visitor to each native settlement can learn a skill this way, so you may need to get there before your rival European nations do. Free Colonists may also learn skills from expert teachers in a [Schoolhouse%20%28Col%29](Schoolhouse), [College%20%28Col%29](College) or [University%20%28Col%29](University).
