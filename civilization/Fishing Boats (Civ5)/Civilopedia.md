# Fishing Boats (Civ5)/Civilopedia

Fishing boats allow a civilization to harvest the valuable crab, fish, whale and pearl resources. To construct fishing boats, you must build a work boat in a coastal city (after your civilization has learned the requisite technology). Work boats are consumed when they construct fishing boats.
