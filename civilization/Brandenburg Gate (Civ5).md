# Brandenburg Gate (Civ5)

Strategy.
The Brandenburg Gate is military-oriented and almost useless to anyone who doesn't pursue a [Domination%20victory%20%28Civ5%29](domination victory) - even the [Great%20Scientist%20%28Civ5%29](Great Scientist) points are overshadowed by specialist slots from [University%20%28Civ5%29](Universities), [Observatory%20%28Civ5%29](Observatories), and [Public%20School%20%28Civ5%29](Public Schools). To such a player, however, it is invaluable because if built in a city with a [Barracks%20%28Civ5%29](Barracks), an [Armory%20%28Civ5%29](Armory), and a [Military%20Academy%20%28Civ5%29](Military Academy), all units produced will have 3 [Promotions%20%28Civ5%29](promotions) upon completion. If the city also has [Alhambra%20%28Civ5%29](Alhambra), newly produced units will have access to powerful tier 4 promotions such as March and Logistics. The free Great General isn't that important, since aggressive players usually have plenty of those lying around. You might use it for another [Citadel%20%28Civ5%29](Citadel) in a vital battle point or to expand your borders and grab [Resources%20%28Civ5%29](resources).
[Japanese%20%28Civ5%29](Japan) can use this wonder for a unique strategy. If [Rifling%20%28Civ5%29](Rifling) has not been researched yet, a city with this wonder still can train [Samurai%20%28Civ5%29](Samurai). Combined with a Barracks, Armory, and Military Academy (or even [Total%20War%20%28Civ5%29](Total War) from [Autocracy%20%28Civ5%29](Autocracy), if you're willing to delay warmongering to such a degree), Samurai can instantly get the [Promotions%20%28Civ5%29%23March](March) promotion - one of the most useful promotions in warfare. Then, as they're upgraded to [Rifleman%20%28Civ5%29](Riflemen) and more advanced infantry units, they can conquer the world alongside [Zero%20%28Civ5%29](Zeroes).
[Polish%20%28Civ5%29](Poland) also can make good use of this wonder thanks to their [Unique%20unit%20%28Civ5%29](unique unit) and [Unique%20building%20%28Civ5%29](unique building). The [List%20of%20technologies%20in%20Civ5](technology) that unlocks [Winged%20Hussar%20%28Civ5%29](Winged Hussars) is a prerequisite for [Military%20Science%20%28Civ5%29](Military Science), and [Ducal%20Stable%20%28Civ5%29](Ducal Stables) provide all mounted units trained in a city with +15 XP. Winged Hussars start with Shock I, so each one trained in a city with a Barracks, Armory, Ducal Stable, and the Brandenburg Gate will be able to take Shock II, Shock III, and Blitz, March, or Mobility as its starting promotions, allowing them to push through even the tightest enemy lines.
