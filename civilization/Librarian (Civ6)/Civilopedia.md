# Librarian (Civ6)/Civilopedia

A librarian is responsible for maintaining the books of a library, as well as acquiring new ones that meet the libraryâ€™s standards. This is a relatively ancient profession, which required rare expertise in reading and evaluating texts. Librarians also serve as archivists and preservers of valuable knowledge for future generations.
