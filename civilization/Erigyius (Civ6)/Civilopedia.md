# Erigyius (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Erigyius was so loyal to Alexander that a suspicious Philip II had him banished from Macedon. Upon the old king’s death, the new king needed cavalry commanders—and Erigyius was up to the task. He served faithfully through Alexander’s campaigns, but was ultimately killed in battle with Bactrians.
