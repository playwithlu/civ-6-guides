The Walls of Babylon are a Babylonian unique building, replacing the standard city [Walls%20%28Civ5%29](Walls). The Walls of Babylon not only significantly boost the city's defensive capabilities (providing twice as many [HP](HP) as normal Walls) while costing less to build, but they also allow the city to deal greater combat damage when conducting any bombardments.
