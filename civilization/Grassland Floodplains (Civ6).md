# Grassland Floodplains (Civ6)

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Grassland Floodplains are a [Terrain%20%28Civ6%29%23Features](terrain feature) in "". They are found on flat [Grassland%20%28Civ6%29](Grassland) [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles) near [River%20%28Civ6%29](Rivers).
Strategy.
As with other Floodplains, Grassland Floodplains can harness extra and from [Floods%20%28Civ6%29](Floods), which are incredibly useful in helping [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities), especially early settlements, to grow quickly to become bustling centers of your empire, just like how major cities of ancient [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) always settle around the riverbank. However, Floods also bring destruction to [Farm%20%28Civ6%29](Farms) and s on Floodplains, which can later be prevented by a [Dam%20%28Civ6%29](Dam).
Similar to other types of Floodplains, Grassland Floodplains tiles can support districts but block placements of all [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](tile improvements) except for Farms and unique improvements that explicitly say they can be built on Floodplains.
