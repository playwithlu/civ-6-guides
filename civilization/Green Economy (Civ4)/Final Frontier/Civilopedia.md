# Green Economy (Civ4)/Final Frontier/Civilopedia

The early twenty-first century saw the rise of the sustainability, or "Green," movement, among Earth's economic powers. Beginning more as a self-defense mechanism against overwhelming pollution rather than as an earnest concern for the environment, the Green Economic Movement insinuated itself through much of human society, allowing for the careful management of resources in accordance with human need. Following the great wars of the late 21st century and the massive destruction they unleashed upon the Earth, a genuine desire to clean up the environment emerged. But to this day with Man spread across the universe, resistant forces among the economically-minded decry the Green Movement for its lack of consideration for industry, as the costs of restrictive measures to keep human waste in check undeniably reduces the ability of such societies to compete with their opponents in industry and war.
