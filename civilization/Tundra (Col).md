# Tundra (Col)

This rather cold, open land can produce a minimal amount of food, but little other agriculture; however, you often find ore here.
In [FreeCol](FreeCol) and [Col](Col) [hills](hills) and [tundra%20%28FreeCol%29](tundra) can be colonized, because these tiles yield some (small) amount of food, unlike [mountains](mountains) and [arctic](arctic) tiles. Tundra and hills are the only center tiles where a colony can get ore for free (without colonists working for it).
