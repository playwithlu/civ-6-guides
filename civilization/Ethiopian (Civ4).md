The Ethiopian people represent a [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ4](civilization) in "[Civilization%20IV](Civilization IV)".
Strategy.
Expert in quick combat and civil society, the Ethiopian Empire draws its strength as a [City%20%28Civ4%29](city)-building empire from the reduced upkeep costs for [List%20of%20civics%20in%20Civ4](civics) and speedily-expanding [Borders%20%28Civ4%29](borders) of [Leaders%20%28Civ4%29](leader) [Zara%20Yaqob%20%28Civ4%29](Zara Yaqob's) "[Organized%20%28Civ4%29](Organized)" and "[Creative%20%28Civ4%29](Creative)" [Leader%20trait%20%28Civ4%29](traits). The [Stele%20%28Civ4%29](Stele) [List%20of%20buildings%20in%20Civ4](building), the Ethiopian replacement for the [Monument%20%28Civ4%29](Monument), spreads happiness as well as culture among Ethiopian cities. But when it comes to lightning combat, few can compare to the [Oromo%20Warrior%20%28Civ4%29](Oromo Warrior), a [Musketeer%20%28Civ4%29](Musketeer) replacement that is immune to first strikes and starts with the Drill I and Drill II [Promotion%20%28Civ4%29](promotions).
