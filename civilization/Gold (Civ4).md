# Gold (Civ4)

Strategy.
Gold is a luxury resource. It provides commerce and happiness to the city that works it, but when improved with a [Mine%20%28Civ4%29](Mine), it takes away 1 from the +2 (or +3 with [Roads%20and%20railroads%20%28Civ4%29](railroad)) that the Mine usually provides. Additionally, Gold doubles the production speed of the [Shwedagon%20Paya%20%28Civ4%29](Shwedagon Paya).
