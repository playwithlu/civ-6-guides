# F9 (C-evo)

"[F9](F9)" is the keyboard function key used in the free-to-play game [C-evo](C-evo) to display in a pop-up window tabulated details of the [Nations](Nations) you are aware of, starting with whichever one is at the top of the current list (usually also the one featured in the first colored column on the technology display and the one that moves first at the end of your turn).
Continue pressing F9 to see other extant nations. Or click the top-left menu to see them and the fallen nations and your own table.
Details shown (where known) are Government and credibility (up to date even if you have not been in recent contact), relationship to you and date of last visit, and Treasury, Population, Territory, Technology, and Exploration (all dated at last known year, current if they are your friends) - with obvious overlap with the charts available at [F6](F6).
Near top right is a "trumpet" icon, which you click to initiate a visit by your emissaries.
The display may be reached also from the menu opened by a click on the government building icon near the bottom right of the map.
