Plains in [C-evo](C-evo) produce: 1 [material%20%28C-evo%29](material), 2 [food%20%28C-evo%29](food), 1 [trade%20%28C-evo%29](trade). 
You get an extra trade (but subject to [Despotism%20%28C-evo%29](Despotism)'s maximum of 2) in each of the following cases:

there is a [river%20%28C-evo%29](river) and you have researched [Map%20Making%20%28C-evo%29](Map Making).

Plains are the equivalent of the Civ series "Grassland with resource". The C-evo "[prairie%20%28C-evo%29](prairie)" is the equivalent of Civ plains. For more food in C-evo, once you have emerged from Despotism, you need [Grassland%20%28C-evo%29](Grassland).
