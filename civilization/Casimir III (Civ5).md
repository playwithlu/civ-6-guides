Lines.
Casimir III's voice actor doesn't seem to be a native speaker of Polish, as he replaces Polish sounds with typical sounds from American English. The most distinctive is the English "l" (which sounds more like a Russian one) or Polish "ł". He has a problem with Polish sounds "sz" and "ś", or "cz" and "ć", which he does not distinguish and pronounces just "sh" and "ch" in English (as in "shy" and "church," respectively). Another pronunciation error is the "hypercorrectness" when pronouncing the nasal sounds "ę" and "ą", which should be pronounced flat at the and of the words (like in the word "się", which should be pronounced "sie"). The voice actor probably did not understand his lines, as the accent is sometimes misplaced.
Intro.
All hail noble King Casimir the Great, protector and sovereign of the Kingdom of Poland. You ascended to the throne during a time of great turmoil, with the nation's economy in shambles and its people demoralized by the wars of your predecessor. And yet, your reign marked the beginning of a new era, with affluence and security afforded only by way of your careful governance. Among your most notable achievements, the code of laws you established gave legal authority to many of the accepted customs of the time, strengthening the nation.
Honored king Casimir, the people have long admired the steady hand of governance you wield. Can you return your kingdom and its subjects to a golden age of prosperity? Will you conquer all those who oppose you, or strive for peaceful relations? Can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time?
