Summary.
With the Age of Reason, the sixth Cultural Advance, man breaks free of superstition and attacks the world with deductive reasoning and a skeptical scientific mind. These inquiries begin with the natural world, but soon cross into human culture, questioning assumptions about equality and rights. The Emancipation Act offer an end to slavery, while Democracy beckons in the near future. The world will never be the same.
Great Library entry.
The Printing Press meant education for the common man. Bibles appeared in the vernacular, and publishers created the first almanacs, dictionaries, and encyclopedias. As ancient texts (including religious ones) received more scrutiny, thinkers discovered many inaccuracies, and a new skepticism arose. Enter the Age of Reason, and a new political movement, which held that the individual ruled over the state, and that the rights of man were inalienable. The age of kings and slaves was fast drawing to a close.
