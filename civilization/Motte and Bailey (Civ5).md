Unique defensive improvement of the Normans. Only a Swordsman may build it.
Strategy.
The Motte and Bailey is indispensable for entrenching Norman troops in strategic locations. It is essentially the same as a [Citadel%20%28Civ5%29](Citadel), but can be constructed without sacrificing a [Great%20General%20%28Civ5%29](Great General). Have your Swordsmen build it in empty [Terrain%20%28Civ5%29](terrain) next to captured [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities) to ensure that the English will suffer heavy losses when they try to retake them.
