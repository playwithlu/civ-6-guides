# Capital (Civ2)

The Capital in "[Civilization%20II](Civilization II)" is the primary [City%20%28Civ2%29](city) of your [Civilizations%20%28Civ2%29](civilization's) [empire](empire), characterized by the existence of its [Palace%20%28Civ2%29](Palace). If a civilization's capital falls, that Civilization may go into [Civil%20war%20%28Civ2%29](civil war).
Capital functions.
The first city that your starting [Settlers%20%28Civ2%29](Settlers) [Unit%20%28Civ2%29](unit) has constructed becomes your Capital (with a free Palace), until you decide to build a new Palace in another city, which causes that city to replace your existing Capital.
