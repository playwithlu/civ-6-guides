# Lamphun (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Legend says when the Buddhist kings of Lamphun and Lop Buri went to war in 1130 and 1150, both agreed to a 'dhammayuddha,' holy construction in lieu of combat around Wat Jam Thewi. The legends may have some truth to themâ€” evidence of these shrines exist at the site today.
