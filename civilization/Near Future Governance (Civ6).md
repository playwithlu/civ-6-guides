# Near Future Governance (Civ6)

Awards 3 {{Envoy6}}s.
Near Future Governance is an [Information%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Information Era) [Civic%20%28Civ6%29](civic) in "". It can be hurried by adopting a [Government%20%28Civ6%29](government) with 10 inherent policy slots. 
Strategy.
Discovering Near Future Governance awards a new {{Governor6}} Governor Title and 3 {{Envoy6}}s, important to win over [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-states). It helps progress towards a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Diplomacy](Diplomatic Victory) in the late game. It can also, under the right circumstances, aid players who are aiming for a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Cultural) or [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Science](Science Victory) instead (e.g. if they've slotted [Collective%20Activism%20%28Civ6%29](Collective Activism) or [International%20Space%20Agency%20%28Civ6%29](International Space Agency) and become the [Suzerain%20%28Civ6%29](Suzerain) of many city-states).
Far more important, however, are the powerful [Future%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Future Era) civics it unlocks, most of which are directly relevant to at least one victory type (or assist in holding one off). These are always randomized, however.
