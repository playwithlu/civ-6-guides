# Voivode (Civ6)/Civilopedia

The blood is the life. The blood is the land. And you are its master. Who was here before your citizens lived and grew on the land? You were. Others live and die, you do not. Your citizens dare questions of you - you, who led armies centuries before they were born! You are the soul and heart of your land. And you will have your blood.
