# Satellite Broadcasts (Civ6)/Civilopedia

The first satellite to relay communications was “Project SCORE” in 1958 AD, which captured the world’s attention by broadcasting a greeting from President Eisenhower. Then “Project Echo” in 1960 (and again in 1964) put a passive reflector balloon in low orbit to bounce radio communications from one spot on the globe to another. Meanwhile, the communications corporation AT&amp;T launched two multinational (American, British, and French) Telstar satellites, able to bounce broadcasts across the Pacific. These all laid the foundations for current satellite networks capable of sending video and audio and computer signals to anyplace in the world – leading to endless hours of distraction.
