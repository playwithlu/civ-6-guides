# Replaceable Parts (Civ5)

Game Info.
Replaceable Parts, the standardization of parts used to build different machines, allows many advances in technology and widespread mechanization. Arming large divisions becomes much easier when you have spare parts that could serve all of their weapons, instead of just one.
This process allows the creation of contemporary infantry, in its first incarnation - the [Great%20War%20Infantry%20%28Civ5%29](Great War Infantry). It also allows building the ultimate defensive building in your cities - the [Military%20base%20%28Civ5%29](Military Base).
