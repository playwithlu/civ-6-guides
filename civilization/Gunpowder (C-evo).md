# Gunpowder (C-evo)

[Gunpowder](Gunpowder) in the free-to-download game [C-evo](C-evo) is one of the key advances affecting military unit strength in the first half of the contest. It adds 3 to the strength of each attacking or defensive {{LinkC-evo|module}} in [ground%20unit%20%28C-evo%29](ground unit)s designed after its discovery, while raising the price of each module to 8 (one more than does [Monotheism](Monotheism), which also adds 3 to the strengths). It also adds to the strength and cost of {{LinkC-evo|naval unit}}s.
Its other value is as a prerequisite to Metallurgy, which is needed for {{LinkC-evo|Ballistics}} and is one of the optional prerequisites for {{LinkC-evo|Science}}.
The only disadvantage in learning Gunpowder early can be that it adds 20% to the price of naval unit modules without a meaningful addition to their strength (because most enemies will produce much stronger ships fairly soon). It is preferable - unless ground unit strength is becoming urgently important - to research {{LinkC-evo|Engineering}} (and ideally {{LinkC-evo|Navigation}} unless your world has very little deep ocean) first, then design a cheap transport vessel that is faster than {{LinkC-evo|Longboats}} and carries more units.
