# Mint (Civ4)

The Mint is the [Unique%20building%20%28Civ4%29](unique building) of the [Malinese%20%28Civ4%29](Malinese) [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ4](civilization).
Strategy.
Compared to the [Forge%20%28Civ4%29](Forge) it replaces, the Mint gives +10% in the [City%20%28Civ4%29](city) it is constructed in.
Mali is a [Spiritual%20%28Civ4%29](Spiritual) and [Financial%20%28Civ4%29](Financial) civilization - two [Leader%20trait%20%28Civ4%29](traits) that can raise a lot of money. Forges are built in most cities, if not all, usually, and are aimed for early on. The Mint is just a Forge that makes cities raise more money. These three together go hand-in-hand spectacularly.
Thanks to the Mint, running an empire at 90% or less science raises substantially more money than usual - as most cities have Forges, and 90% or less science makes every city raise cash, you'll raise much more. [Mansa%20Musa%20%28Civ4%29](Mansa Musa's) commerce boost makes this even better.
