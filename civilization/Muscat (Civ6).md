# Muscat (Civ6)

Muscat is a trade [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-state) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It was added in the [Vikings%20Scenario%20Pack%20%28Civ6%29](Vikings Scenario Pack).
Strategy.
Since [Commercial%20Hub%20%28Civ6%29](Commercial Hubs) are likely to be present in most, if not all, of your [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities), Muscat can give a nice empire-wide boost, especially for [Malian%20%28Civ6%29](Mali), [Polish%20%28Civ6%29](Poland), and the [Ottoman%20%28Civ6%29](Ottomans). If at war with the [Suzerain%20%28Civ6%29](Suzerain) of Muscat, pillaging their Commercial Hubs will further demoralize the enemy.
