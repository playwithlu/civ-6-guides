# Ironclad (Civ6)

The Ironclad is an [Industrial%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Industrial Era) [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Naval%20melee](naval melee unit) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It upgrades from the [Caravel%20%28Civ6%29](Caravel) (or its replacements) and requires .
In the "" expansion, the Ironclad requires 1 to train and 1 per turn to maintain.
Strategy.
Being the first armored ship in the game, and thus a precursor to modern vessels, the Ironclad is a good upgrade from the earlier Caravel, although the difference (15 Combat Strength) is not as big as in other cases. But more importantly, the Ironclad serves as a necessary stepping stone towards real modern melee ships, which become available quite a bit later. You'll need to be able to build Ironclads, which can be a problem, because you'll never be able to modernize your fleet if you don't get it.
The gist is that the Ironclad (and the later [Destroyer%20%28Civ6%29](Destroyer)) represents the only advanced naval melee units in your fleet. Without it, your ability to take coastal [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) will be severely jeopardized, and is non-existent without a ground army.
