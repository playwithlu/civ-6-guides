# Airborne Warfare (Civ3)/Civilopedia

It was not long after propeller-driven aircraft were first used in war (during WWI) that the idea of using planes to
deliver combat troops was tested. Perhaps surprisingly, however, it was in the Soviet Union in 1930 that troops were
first dropped from a bomber during a military exercise. A few years later, in a public exercise, the Russians impressed
foreign dignitaries when over 1000 parachutists landed successfully. The importance of this event was no doubt not lost
on Japanese military officials, as they (along with Germany) were quick to see the potential of using airborne troops to
surprise and quickly overwhelm key positions. During the opening months of WWII, Japan staged successful airborne
landings during their bid to capture the Dutch East Indies, notably their airdrop near Palembang's airfield in Sumatra
on 14 January, 1942. Although the United States did not conduct any airdrops in the Pacific Theatre during WWII, plans
had been drawn up to use elements of the 101st Airborne Division if an actual invasion on the home islands of Japan had
been necessary.
