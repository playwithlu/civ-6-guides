# Growth (CTP2)

Gameplay.
The Growth Rating indicates how quickly {{LinkCTP2|Cities}} increase their {{LinkCTP2|Population}}. Several factors contribute to the growth rate, including the distribution of labor in {{LinkCTP2|Cities}}, {{LinkCTP2|Improvements}} that promote growth and the {{LinkCTP2|Government}} type under which a leader rules his or her empire. Cities that produce an abundance of {{LinkCTP2|Food}} will grow quicker than {{LinkCTP2|Cities}} that produce merely adequate amounts of {{LinkCTP2|Food}}.
