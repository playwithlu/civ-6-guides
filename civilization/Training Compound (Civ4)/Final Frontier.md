# Training Compound (Civ4)/Final Frontier

Strategy.
Training Compounds provide all military units constructed in this Star System with additional Prestige.
Civilopedia entry.
Much of military training is based on intricate processes of muscle memory, developed by performing the same actions in a repeated manner until almost no input from the nervous system is required. "Instinct," "Empty Mind," "No-Brainer," the technique has many names, but all once depended on an extremely strict, extremely lengthy training regimen. And while strict discipline is still required to keep cadets sharp and under control, special "Training Compounds" injected directly into the soldiers' muscles can now mimic trained muscle memory with an almost eighty percent success rate. In effect, troops can now receive battle experience without ever leaving their base. The result is noticeably fiercer, more reliable soldiers.
