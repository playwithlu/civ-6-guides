# Public Transport (Civ6)

Public Transport is an Economic [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
Even with its increased bonus in "", chances are you won't get much use out of Public Transport. If you're trying to build the largest [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) possible (or you just want places to build [Food%20Market%20%28Civ6%29](Food Markets) and [Shopping%20Mall%20%28Civ6%29](Shopping Malls)), it could be worth slotting until you've replaced your [Farm%20%28Civ6%29](Farms) with [Neighborhood%20%28Civ6%29](Neighborhoods) and then immediately swapping it out for something less situational.
For "", the bonuses have been completely changed, further emphasizing the [Appeal%20%28Civ6%29](Appeal) of a Neighborhood. Since players typically place Neighborhoods in areas of high Appeal, the extra and will kick in so long as Public Transport is active. This can turn into a rather sizeable empire-wide boost if planned right.
Bugs.
In "Gathering Storm", the effect from "Rise and Fall" still triggers.
