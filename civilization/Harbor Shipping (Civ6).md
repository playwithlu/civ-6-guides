# Harbor Shipping (Civ6)

Extra {{Admiral6}} points at completion
Harbor Shipping is a [Project%20%28Civ6%29](project) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It becomes available after building a [Harbor%20%28Civ6%29](Harbor) [District%20%28Civ6%29](district) (or one of its replacements).
With the aid of the city production facilities, trade in the local Harbor is much faster and more profitable, converting 15% of the city's {{Production6}} output to {{Gold6}}. When completed, it yields {{Admiral6}} points equal to approximately 22% of the {{Production6}} invested in it (on Standard [Speed%20%28Civ6%29](speed)).
