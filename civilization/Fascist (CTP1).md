Great Library entry.
Fascism inspired political and military extremism. Extolling the state as absolute, Fascism demanded discipline, devotion to duty, and the subordination of all individual activities to the good of the state. To add to this, Fascist rulers used modern propaganda to whip their people into a frenzy of racial hatred for which only military action could provide sufficient release. From the Storm Troopers of Germany to the Kamikaze of Japan, the Fascist soldier laid his life on the line for his faith in military conquest. Mussolini's slogan was, "to believe, to obey, to combat."
