# Confederacy (Civ5)/Civilopedia

The Confederate States of America, also known as the Confederacy, was the name chosen by the southern states that opted to secede from the U.S. following Abraham Lincoln's election to the presidency in 1860. Viewing Lincoln's perspectives on slavery as leading to an infringement upon the individual rights of each state, including their right to break from the constitution and secede, the southern states did just that.
The Confederate President, Jefferson Davis, sought to directly oversee not only the logistical issues of the war effort, but also the military strategies and appointments of the southern armies (much like his counterpart in the North). The Confederacy was faced with war against an opponent armed with superior equipment, greater manpower, and more raw materials dedicated to the conflict. These concerns did little to hamper the southern forces' enthusiasm for the fight ahead, as they viewed this as a battle for their way of life and the individual rights of every state versus the federal government.
