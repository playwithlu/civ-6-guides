# Shinto Precepts (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Shinto is an ancient Japanese religion. Starting about 500 BCE (or earlier) it was originally "an amorphous mix of nature worship, fertility cults, divination techniques, hero worship, and shamanism." Its name was derived from the Chinese words "shin tao" ("the way of the gods") in the 8th Century CE.
