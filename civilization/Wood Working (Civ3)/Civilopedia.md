# Wood Working (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Wood from forests was used from the times of early civilization for items such as wooden clubs, spears and
dugout canoes. As stone tools improved forests could be cut to provide wood for burning, building and furniture,
and when metal tools were developed this use and cutting of forests increased. In the Mesopotamia region, cedar
from the Lebanon area was in high demand -- surviving texts from Egypt show large amounts of it being imported by
ship for shipbuilding, furniture and for use in the Pharaoh's palace.
