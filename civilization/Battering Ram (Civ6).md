# Battering Ram (Civ6)

The Battering Ram is an [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Support](support unit) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". Its purpose is to breach [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) [Walls%20%28Civ6%29](defenses).
Strategy.
A siege in ancient times was a grueling experience. [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Melee](Melee units) do significantly reduced damage versus city fortifications, which makes taking down [Ancient%20Walls%20%28Civ6%29](Ancient Walls) difficult. The Battering Ram solves this problem, allowing melee units (and [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Anti-cavalry](anti-cavalry units), in "") to do full damage to Walls! Note that you will still need to beat the Walls before attacking the city proper.
The Battering Ram becomes [obsolete](obsolete) (cannot be produced anymore) after developing [Civil%20Engineering%20%28Civ6%29](Civil Engineering); it also becomes useless when the target [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) has itself developed [Urban%20Defenses%20%28Civ6%29](Urban Defenses). It can be upgraded then to a [Medic%20%28Civ6%29](Medic) and salvage at least some of its usefulness.
In "Gathering Storm", the Battering Ram is useless against anything but Ancient Walls. This plays much better into the historical accuracy of the unit, and adds a new layer of sophistication to early-to-middle game tactics.
