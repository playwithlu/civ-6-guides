# Cuneiform (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Cuneiform was the earliest form of writing in the Mesopotamian region. It originated as a picture language,
similar to hieroglyphics, and with repeated use over time these pictures became simpler and then abstract.
Eventually they developed into a form of syllabic alphabet which used wedge and hook shapes. The word cuneiform
is derived from the Latin cuneus, which means wedge, and forma, which means shape. Most commonly cuneiform was
pressed into soft clay tablets with a stylus, though occasionally stone, metal or wood was used.
