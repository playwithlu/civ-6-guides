Strategy.
This Mehal Sefari is purely defensive in nature, supporting the tactical advantages of the Ethiopians as a whole. It can really make the life of any army trying to attack the Ethiopian heartlands miserable. It is also generally stronger in rough [Terrain%20%28Civ5%29](terrain).

The Drill I [Promotions%20%28Civ5%29](promotion) can turn out to be more powerful than it looks: if these units are trained in a [City%20%28Civ5%29](city) with a [Barracks%20%28Civ5%29](Barracks), [Armory%20%28Civ5%29](Armory), and [Military%20Academy%20%28Civ5%29](Military Academy) combined with either the [Brandenburg%20Gate%20%28Civ5%29](Brandenburg Gate) or the [Total%20War%20%28Civ5%29](Total War) tenet of the [Ideology%20%28Civ5%29](Autocracy) ideology, Mehal Sefari turn into excellent rough terrain fighters that can have access to advanced promotions like March and Blitz.
