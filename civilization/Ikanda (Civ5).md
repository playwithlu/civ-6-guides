Strategy.
The Ikanda is the best unit-training building in the game. It provides a free Buffalo Horns [Promotions%20%28Civ5%29](promotion) to every [Warrior%20%28Civ5%29](Warrior), [Spearman%20%28Civ5%29](Spearman), [Swordsman%20%28Civ5%29](Swordsman), [Impi%20%28Civ5%29](Impi), and [Longswordsman%20%28Civ5%29](Longswordsman) produced in the [City%20%28Civ5%29](city). For other units, the Ikanda functions like a normal Barracks. (Note that the in-game description is a little confusing, and supposes that cavalry units also get the unique promotions, which is not the case!)
In addition to the , attack, and defense bonuses Buffalo Horns confers, this promotion enables Zulu units to earn two more unique promotions as they advance in level, if desired. These promotions and the bonuses they grant are as follows:
Flank attack percentages given are based on the 10% normal bonus. Hence, all three promotions will raise the flank attack bonus to +17.5%.
