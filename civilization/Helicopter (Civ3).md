# Helicopter (Civ3)

Helicopters are essentially air transports that can carry one unit to any square within their operational range,
regardless of enemy units. Helicopters may carry foot soldiers only -- no mechanized units allowed.
A city needs oil and rubber in its Strategic Resource box to build a helicopter.
