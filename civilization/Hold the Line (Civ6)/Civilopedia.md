# Hold the Line (Civ6)/Civilopedia

On 25 October, 1854 AD, the British 93rd Highland (Sutherland) Regiment was in position, along with a small force of Royal Marines and some Turkish infantrymen, near the British headquarters during the battle of Balaklava. Deployed in line two deep, when the massed Russian cavalry charged, the Highlanders didn't form square but instead stood their ground, firing rapidly into the oncoming charge. The Russians broke, the first time that infantry in line had routed an oncoming cavalry charge. Their stand hearted the units to either side, and saved the day. The event was immortalized by William H. Russell, a London 'Times' correspondent, and his description of the "thin red streak tipped with a line of steel" would become "the thin red line" ... used ever since to represent courageous composure in the face of onrushing danger.
