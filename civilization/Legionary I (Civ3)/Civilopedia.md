# Legionary I (Civ3)/Civilopedia

The Roman Legions, created during the early wars of the Republic and tested during the three Punic
Wars against Carthage, were the fighting force that conquered and held the Roman Empire together for
five centuries. Each legion was composed of 6000 men, divided into 60 smaller groups known as
centuries. Nearly unstoppable on the attack, the legion was relatively weak on defense. Besides being
highly skilled fighters, the legions were also used extensively to extend the empire's road network
and to build defensive fortifications along its frequently changing border. The legion's demise as
a military unit was accelerated by the destruction of Emperor Valens' army by gothic knights in the
fourth century.
