Great Library entry.
The Cathedral movement of the 12th and 13th centuries embodied the growing wealth and faith of European cities. Architects strove for the maximum vertical space in their symbolic attempt to bring man closer to God. Their quest for height encouraged flying buttresses, pointed arches, and crossed ribs. Naves at Amiens vaulted an incredible 139 feet and took sixteen years to build, testifying to the faith and inspiration of both community and builder.
