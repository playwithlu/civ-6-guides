# Stable (Civ5)/Civilopedia

In "Civilization V" a stable is a military barracks for cavalry units. Here the cavalry soldiers are housed, fed and trained, as are their equine counterparts. Throughout much of history the cavalry has been the arm favored by a society's wealthy sons, for the simple reason that only the richest young men had ever ridden a horse. Because of this the cavalry stables/barracks were often much more luxurious than the poor infantry's dwellings.
