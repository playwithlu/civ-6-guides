# Mass Transit (Civ1)

A Mass Transit system is essential for controlling the pollution from cities with large populations.
Civilopedia entry.
Within a few decades of the invention of the Automobile, the horse and carriage disappeared from city streets. However, the Automobile brought new problems, including air pollution and the release of large quantities of carbon monoxide into the atmosphere. As cities became larger and more crowded, travel around town became difficult and time consuming. The development of Mass Transit, including buses, trolleys, subways, and light rail, led to a reduction in
traffic and an accompanying reduction in pollution.
