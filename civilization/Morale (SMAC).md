# Morale (SMAC)

Morale reflects the training and experience of your military units. Morale levels range from Very Green to Green to Disciplined to Hardened, Veteran, Commando, and Elite. A unit receives a +12.5% combat bonus for each morale level. Morale plays a particularly important role in {{LinkSMAC|psi combat}}, and in combat between {{LinkSMAC|probe teams}}, since no weapon and armor values are considered in those cases.
Morale levels:
New units typically begin with "Green" morale, though this may be higher or lower depending on your social engineering {{LinkSMAC|MORALE}} setting. A new unit's morale can also be increased if a base has a {{LinkSMAC|Command Center}} or other related {{LinkSMAC|base facility}}.
A unit victorious in combat will often receive a morale upgrade (the lower its morale level, the more likely an upgrade).
Elite units receive a special bonus--an additional move each turn.
Aliens.
Alien units such as {{LinkSMAC|Mind Worms}} have "life cycles" which correspond to morale levels. Alien units are not affected by {{LinkSMAC|Command Center}}s and military facilities, but their life cycle levels can be improved by building {{LinkSMAC|Biology Lab}}s and other similar facilities. The transport capacity of an {{LinkSMAC|Isle of the Deep}} is determined by its life cycle level: one unit for each level.
