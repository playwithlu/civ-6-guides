Strategy.
Hills are one of the most basic features of the land, and it is hard to state all their advantages. First, Hills ensure extra to cities (more so with ), without any [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](improvement).
Second, a [Mine%20%28Civ6%29](Mine) can always be constructed on a Hill even without it containing any [Resource%20%28Civ6%29](resources). The only drawback is that they restrict farmland placement, but [Civil%20Engineering%20%28Civ6%29](Civil Engineering) helps to circumvent this limitation for Hills in [Plains%20%28Civ6%29](Plains) and [Grassland%20%28Civ6%29](Grassland).
Third, Hills provide defensive ground in the event of combat. Ranged units on Hills enjoy both this defensive advantage and a vantage point from which they can shoot at anything in their full range (unless there are other Hills with [Woods%20%28Civ6%29](Woods) or [Rainforest%20%28Civ6%29](Rainforest) on them).
However, it is generally true that a city in hilly land will have trouble feeding its population, especially in the beginning of the game. The bonus resource, however, helps splendidly with this, since it gives bonus , and it's found exclusively on Hills.
The [Ethiopian%20%28Civ6%29](Ethiopian) [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) under [Menelik%20II%20%28Civ6%29](Menelik II) gains numerous special benefits from settling in and around Hills, such as bonus and from settling on them, good placement spots for their [Rock-Hewn%20Church%20%28Civ6%29](Rock-Hewn Churches), and a strategic advantage for the [Oromo%20Cavalry%20%28Civ6%29](Oromo Cavalry). [Georgian%20%28Civ6%29](Georgia's) [Khevsur%20%28Civ6%29](Khevsur) also gain an advantage when fighting on Hills. Be sure to look out for hilly areas when settling cities as these two civilizations.
