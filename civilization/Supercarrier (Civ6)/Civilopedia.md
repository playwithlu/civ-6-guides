# Supercarrier (Civ6)/Civilopedia

The first ship to be described by journalists as a “supercarrier” was the HMS Ark Royal in 1938, 685 feet long and capable of carrying 72 aircraft (though it didn’t do her much good when torpedoed in 1941). Next, the Americans declared their 45-thousand ton Midway-class of carriers as “super” in 1943; three were completed. But it was the Cold War nuclear-powered carriers of the United States and Russia that might legitimately be called supercarriers. Virtually floating cities, the American Nimitz-class carriers have unlimited range for 20-25 years, driven by two nuclear reactors, carry over 5000 ship and flight crew, have between 85-90 planes and helicopters, and have a displacement between 100-104 thousand tons. And that doesn’t even count the missiles aboard.
