# Citrus (Civ5)

Game Info.
Luxury resource added in "".
Strategy.
 Citrus is found in [Jungle%20%28Civ5%29](Jungles) and [Grassland%20%28Civ5%29](Grasslands) with [Forest%20%28Civ5%29](Forests), which need to be cut down before it can be improved with a [Plantation%20%28Civ5%29](Plantation). Citrus is one of the few luxuries that provide a +1 and bonus instead of the usual 2 ; the Plantation adds another point of - and later, another point of - for a total bonus of +2 and . Since the base terrain under the Jungle is usually Grassland, the total bonus is 4, so the resource acts as great booster for the nearby [City%20%28Civ5%29](city) (almost as great as a bonus resource).
The Sun God belief adds another point of on the tile.
