# Treasure (Civ5)/Civilopedia

The Treasure Unit encompasses the entirety of the Spanish Treasure Fleet system in the New World, from mine to destination. After gold or silver was excavated in various locations in the Americas, it was shipped along land by llama and mule, traveling well-documented routes to specific port towns along the Spanish Main. From these ports, the treasure was then loaded onto galleons and merchant vessels, which traveled together in a massive convoy across the Atlantic Ocean. These ships followed a precise path each time they crossed the Atlantic to Spain, allowing themselves to be easily protected from pirates and thieves. These treasure units helped make Spain the wealthiest civilization at the time, and were instrumental in the creation of one of the world's most impressive naval operations.
