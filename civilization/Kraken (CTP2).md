Great Library entry.
Whereas the Moray Striker derived its navigation and control systems design from genetic research of existing species of sharks, the Kraken was the first operational vehicle to employ an entirely new organic system, based on no living creature. The Kraken evolved through many prototypes and iterations, finally settling on a genetically tailored vehicle of unprecedented efficiency and power. Its propulsion system worked like a turbine engine, taking in seawater and ejecting it with considerable force. It employed large "gills" that extracted oxygen from seawater, providing internal compartments with a renewable oxygen source. The Kraken was unquestionably the most formidable underwater assault craft of the Genetic Age.
