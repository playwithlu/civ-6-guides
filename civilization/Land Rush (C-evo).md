# Land Rush (C-evo)

Land Rush is one of the [predesigned%20maps%20%28C-evo%29](predesigned maps) that comes with the standard download of the free game [C-evo](C-evo).
Introduction.
Four nations battle for land and scarce resources on a 44% size map with about 34% land. Winnable against standard AI on "Hard" [difficulty%20level%20%28C-evo%29](difficulty level) with a bit of luck and skill. At "Easy" level it is a doddle, as illustrated near the bottom of this page.
Details.
One of the "Total Fairness" series, this map starts all nations on totally identical territories in sight of the sea but not able to use it fully until a port is built. All are technically on one continent, so you will not need Navigation in order to meet all rivals but it will be of value later. 
Each capital is on an 'island" comprising 118 land tiles and a 2-tile lake, joined by corners at each end to smaller "islands" that link to other bigger islands. Total size of the continent is 516 land tiles. Elsewhere, various separate islands and extensions of the Arctic or Antarctic add about 50 land tiles in addition to 30 tiles of Arctic terrain that is spread, in about the usual fashion, along north and south borders, with a few walruses available for food and trade. There are about 1,080 sea tiles and a few two-tile lakes.
Regrettably, perhaps, some mountains, walruses and fish are totally unusable and there is "waste" space north and south of the continent. There is also a wasteful surfeit of Cobalt.
Tips.
Build at least four militia early, mainly for exploration, and don't be afraid of a bit of desert blocking your way. Find and exploit the fish+fruit site west of your capital then use longboats to find fish south, east, and north-east. By that time, unless playing at an easy or beginner level, rivals will be competing in the "land rush" and may spoil your expansion plans.
At harder levels you will need [air%20unit%20%28C-evo%29](air unit)s to block enemy advances and eventually shield your advancing attackers.
