# Mass Production (Civ6)

Mass Production is a [Renaissance%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Renaissance Era) [Technology%20%28Civ6%29](technology) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI). "It can be hurried by building a [Lumber%20Mill%20%28Civ6%29](Lumber Mill). 
In "", it requires [Military%20Tactics%20%28Civ6%29](Military Tactics), [Buttress%20%28Civ6%29](Buttress) and [Education%20%28Civ6%29](Education). 
Strategy.
The concept of mass production, where different items are made exactly the same using uniform parts which can be interchanged, prepares humankind for the Industrial Revolution, which will change the world as we know it. The full scope of implementation of this concept has to wait until such time as technology develops, but in the Renaissance some things can already be mass-produced. The invention of the printing press allows mass production of standardized texts, and the utilization of uniform planks allows mass production of ships. A new structure is invented to implement this in [Harbor%20%28Civ6%29](Harbor) districts: the [Shipyard%20%28Civ6%29](Shipyard).
This tech is usually not very useful to any non-seafaring [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization). In fact, even civs with [Coastal%20%28Civ6%29](coastal) [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) but no great navies can't benefit that much from it: the tech only enables the Tier II Harbor building, whose utility is highly dependent upon the Harbor's [Adjacency%20bonus%20%28Civ6%29](adjacency bonus), and adds little else to the city but . The [Venetian%20Arsenal%20%28Civ6%29](Venetian Arsenal) is a useful [Wonder%20%28Civ6%29](wonder), albeit somewhat difficult to place.
Now seafaring civs have much more use for the Shipyard - besides the bonus (which is likely to be bigger in the cities of civs specialized in coastal settling), it adds the usual other bonuses, of which the [XP](XP) bonus is maybe the most important to further boost your growing navy.
But regardless of what use the Shipyard is, this tech also unlocks the all-important [Industrialization%20%28Civ6%29](Industrialization) in the next [Era%20%28Civ6%29](era). For this reason only, every civ will need it sooner or later.
