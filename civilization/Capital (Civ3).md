# Capital (Civ3)

The Capital in "[Civilization%20III](Civilization III)" is the primaryÂ [City%20%28Civ3%29](city) of your [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ3](civilization's) [empire](empire), characterized by the existence of its [Palace%20%28Civ3%29](Palace). Your capital is the center of your empire and experiences almost no [Corruption%20%28Civ3%29](corruption), making it potentially very productive.
Capital functions.
The first city that your starting [Settler%20%28Civ3%29](Settler) founds becomes your Capital (with a free Palace); you may move your Capital by rebuilding a Palace in another city. The location of your capital, and ease of access for your empire's cities to it, determines their corruption and waste. The closer your capital is to most of your cities, the lower the corruption for each of your individual cities nearby. The [Forbidden%20Palace%20%28Civ3%29](Forbidden Palace) serves as a virtual Palace for the purposes of distance corruption but not rank corruption.
