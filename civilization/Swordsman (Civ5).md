Strategy.
The Swordsman is the most powerful standard melee unit during the early game, much stronger than the [Spearman%20%28Civ5%29](Spearman) and Warrior. Armed with the first forged weapons and armor, the Swordsman can soak up quite some damage and as such are very useful as a first line of defense and when attacking early-[Era%20%28Civ5%29](era) [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities). A player that has Swordsmen can decimate large lines of Spearmen or Warriors very quickly.
Swordsmen are particularly vulnerable to mounted units, as all but the [Chariot%20Archer%20%28Civ5%29](Chariot Archer) can move after attacking, getting a hit and moving away so the Swordsman can't retaliate. Also, keep in mind that you'll need to train Swordsmen.
