# Soothsay (CTP2)

People look to s for answers about the state of their lives and, more importantly, what the future has in store for them. A can Soothsay, preaching doom and damnation for the people of the target city. This sends people into a panic, and unhappiness takes a sharp dive for a turn.
This attack is always successful. It costs 500 to perform.
