# Organized Religion (Civ5)

Organized Religion is a [Social%20policies%20%28Civ5%29](social policy) in "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)". It is part of the [Piety%20%28Civ5%29](Piety) tree.
Organizing the pious feelings of the masses with the effective leadership of a central church has many benefits. Most of these, however, are evident in the two main religious buildings, which reflect the new level of dedication of your society in every detail: architecture, decoration, splendor, wealth. This, in turn, increases their own Faith effect over the populace. 
Strategy.
Being the requirement for mostly all other Policies in the tree, adopting Organized Religion first is usually the sensible choice. Besides unlocking higher-end Policies, the additional {{FaithIcon5}}Â Faith per building is great in the beginning of the game - both for founding a Pantheon and later, a Religion. Note, however, that if you have no religious buildings at all, you will be wasting a Policy slot, so aim at building at least one [Shrine%20%28Civ5%29](Shrine) before - or right after - adopting this Policy.
