Teddy wields a big stick on his [Continent%20%28Civ6%29](continent), but if you leave him alone he will stay peaceful. Just don't try to outrace him to a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Culture Victory).
This is the standard version of Teddy Roosevelt when players do not have the [Persona%20Packs%20%28Civ6%29](Persona Packs) enabled. When they are enabled, Teddy Roosevelt will be split into two alternate [Persona%20%28Civ6%29](personas): [Teddy%20Roosevelt%20%28Rough%20Rider%29%20%28Civ6%29](Rough Rider Teddy), with a new appearance and a variation of his former abilities, and [Teddy%20Roosevelt%20%28Bull%20Moose%29%20%28Civ6%29](Bull Moose Teddy), using his former model but with new abilities.
Intro.
 And so it is upon your broad shoulders, Theodore Roosevelt, to charge forth and lead your people on their great adventure. Use your military might to give the peoples of your homeland the square deal they so desperately deserve. Surely you will raise America into the limelight and attract visitors from across the oceans just to see your lands. Bully for you, Mr. President.
In-Game.
Teddy Roosevelt's unique [Agenda%20%28Civ6%29](agenda) is Big Stick Policy. He likes civilizations that have a city on his home [Continent%20%28Civ6%29](continent) and remain peaceful, while disliking those that start wars in his home continent.
His [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader ability) is Roosevelt Corollary. His units receive a +5 Combat Strength bonus on the American home continent, and all [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles) in a [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) with a [National%20Park%20%28Civ6%29](National Park) receive +1 [Appeal%20%28Civ6%29](Appeal). America under Roosevelt can also build the [Rough%20Rider%20%28Civ6%29](Rough Rider) when [Rifling%20%28Civ6%29](Rifling) is researched.
Detailed Approach.
Early in the game, the only American advantage is +5 Combat Strength on their home continent. They will want to expand fast across their continent and move to gain the support of the nearby city-states. With double-strength [Government%20%28Civ6%29](government) legacy bonuses, their choice of government is important, though [Classical%20Republic%20%28Civ6%29](Classical Republic) and [Democracy%20%28Civ6%29](Democracy) are the most helpful with America's preference: a Culture Victory. With their [Film%20Studio%20%28Civ6%29](Film Studio), National Park bonus, and two post-[Industrial%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Industrial) [Unique%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](unique units), they shine from the 20th century onwards.
