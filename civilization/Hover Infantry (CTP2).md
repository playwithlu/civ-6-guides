Summary.
[Diamond%20Age%20%28CTP2%29](Diamond Age) infantry unit.
Gameplay.
The Hover Infantry is the most powerful infantry unit in the game. Capable of negotiating even the most treacherous [Terrain%20%28CTP2%29](terrain) with speed and efficacy, Hover Infantry deliver devastatingly effective attacks. They are an ideal complement to the [Fusion%20Tank%20%28CTP2%29](Fusion Tank), but cannot travel on [Beach%20%28CTP2%29](beach) and [Shallow%20Water%20%28CTP2%29](shallow water) tiles.
Great Library entry.
The development of applied chaos theory opened up new opportunities in the realm of physics. Scientists were able to develop reliable anti-gravity systems that could act as a propulsion system for small objects. The military leaped on this discovery and immediately poured considerable financial resources into developing a hover system for individual soldiers. After several years, the hover infantry unit was born. Although the hover infantry's anti-grav system does not permit him to fly vertically, it acts as propulsion and levitation system that enables him to traverse any solid terrain. With the arrival of hover infantry on the battlefields, conventional artillery, tank and infantry units began to find themselves outmaneuvered, outgunned and outclassed.
