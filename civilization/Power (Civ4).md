# Power (Civ4)

Power () refers to electrical power, and its purpose is to augment the [Factory%20%28Civ4%29](Factory) with an additional +50% . The existence of the asset in a [City%20%28Civ4%29](city) adds an unconditional [Health%20%28Civ4%29](unhealth) penalty of +2 irrespective of the source and whether the power is being put to use by this structure.
Power generated by a "Dirty" source ( [Coal%20%28Civ4%29](Coal) or [Shale%20Plant%20%28Civ4%29](shale)) carries with it an extra +2 penalty. "Clean" power sources, when available, take the place of dirty power and remove this additional burden.
