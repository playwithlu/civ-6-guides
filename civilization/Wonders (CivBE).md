# Wonders (CivBE)

This page contains information related to [Wonders](Wonders) in "".
National Wonders.
Unlike global wonders, every civilization can build one of each national wonder regardless of whether or not other civilizations have built it already. All Wonders provide +5 {{DiplomaticCapitalIconBE}}, with the exception of the Headquarters (+3 {{DiplomaticCapitalIconBE}}) and the Spy Agency (+2 {{DiplomaticCapitalIconBE}}).
Artifact Wonders.
The "[Rising%20Tide](Rising Tide)" expansion adds the [Artifacts%20%28CivBE%29](Artifact system). Several national wonders may be rewarded to players using this system. These are unlocked by combining [Progenitor%20Artifacts%20%28CivBE%29](Progenitor Artifacts).
Wonders.
Only one of these can be built in the entire world. If another civilizations has already built one of them, then you can't, and vice versa. Each city can hold an unlimited number of these. Wonders lost in razed cities are lost forever.
The Monomyth [Virtues%20%28CivBE%29](virtue), in the knowledge tree, provides +7 {{CultureBE}} for every great Wonder.
All global wonders in Rising Tide by default provide 5 {{DiplomaticCapitalBE}}. The [Pan-Asian%20Cooperative%20%28CivBE%29](Pan-Asian Cooperative) gets 6-8 {{DiplomaticCapitalIconBE}} instead, and the first wonder constructed in each city is free.
Projects.
Projects take up a plot of land. A hex within an extended range of the city building it (6 hexes) is used up. Any improvements or resources on said hex are destroyed to make room for the wonder in question. These are typically related to victory conditions. They have HP and can be destroyed by enemies.
