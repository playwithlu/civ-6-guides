# Jaguar (Civ5)

Game Info.
[Unique%20unit%20%28Civ5%29](Unique) front-line unit of the [Aztec%20%28Civ5%29](Aztec) [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilization). Replaces the [Warrior%20%28Civ5%29](Warrior). Available right from the start of the game.
Strategy.
The Jaguar is the Aztec replacement for the Warrior and is thus available right from the start of the game. Its bonuses in [Forest%20%28Civ5%29](forests) and [Jungle%20%28Civ5%29](jungles) are only matched by the [Iroquois%20%28Civ5%29](Iroquois) civilization's [Mohawk%20Warrior%20%28Civ5%29](Mohawk Warrior), but its ability to heal when killing a unit gives it the advantage. This can be very useful in [Combat%20%28Civ5%29](combat).
Combine those bonuses with the civilization's bonus when killing any unit, and you get one of the best early rush civilizations in the game. Furthermore, all its bonuses are transferred when the unit is upgraded, which makes it imperative for the Aztec player to produce as many Jaguars as possible while they're still available. Afterwards they will form a formidable base for your army!
