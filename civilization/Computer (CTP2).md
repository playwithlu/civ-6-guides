Although computational machines, most notably the abacus, have been around for millennia, it was not until World War II that developments in advanced mechanical computational devices arrived. The first computers were developed to crack encrypted German wartime communications. Computers improved with advances in vacuum tube, transistor and integrated circuitry technology. Computers found commercial and educational uses in the 1950s and '60s, fueling a revolution of epic proportions. With the introduction of the first personal computers in the late 1970s, computers began to enhance peoples' abilities to perform many tasks, including document creation, mathematics and research. Sales of personal computers skyrocketed in the 1980 and '90s as businesses, schools and institutions found their power and capabilities indispensable. By the beginning of the 21st century, the use of computers and microprocessors pervaded almost every aspect of human life.
