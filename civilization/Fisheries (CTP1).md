 is a [List%20of%20improvements%20%28CTP1%29](tile improvement) in "Civilization: Call to Power".
Gameplay.
Fisheries are the medium-level ocean-based tile improvements which use improved boating and netting to create an additional 15-40 food when worked. Depending on the terrain, this improvement costs 500-900 PW and takes two turns to build. 
Great Library entry.
Technology provided a means for fisherman to create fisheries to catch more fish. Better materials such as nylon or steel mesh coupled with floats and weights allowed nets to span across greater areas. Bigger nets, however, threatened the extinction of some species. Fisheries captured entire generations of fish, which would subsequently eliminate the possibility of breeding. Fisherman soon learned to return some of the captured fish to the oceans to breed.
