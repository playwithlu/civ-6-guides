Strategy.
Each Pantanal tile has a yield of 2 and 2 . Since Culture is often hard to generate early in the game, incorporating natural wonder tiles can provide a vital head start through the .
Unfortunately, as with all natural wonders, the Pantanal tiles cannot be developed or improved. Because of this, natural wonders may be more of a hindrance than an asset later in the game - a natural wonder in the heart of a can spoil adjacency bonuses for Farms and districts. In general, passable wonder tiles are significantly better than an unimproved tile of any kind, but are often less productive than an ordinary tile with an improvement or a district.
Note that the wonder tiles can be incorporated into - if a player wishes to found a Park, then it is often wise to include as many wonder tiles as possible within a city. The Pantanal is tailor-made to be turned into a National Park as it comes in the diamond shape required for National Parks. However, with luck and careful tile management it is possible to include several surrounding tiles in multiple National Parks, using each tile of the Pantanal as an anchor for its own diamond shape.
