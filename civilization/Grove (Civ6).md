# Grove (Civ6)

The Grove is a basic conservation [Building%20%28Civ6%29](building) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is built in the [Preserve%20%28Civ6%29](Preserve) [District%20%28Civ6%29](district).
Strategy.
The Grove functions very similarly to the [Sanctuary%20%28Civ6%29](Sanctuary), focusing on , , and while being a lot cheaper and unlocked four [Era%20%28Civ6%29](eras) earlier. As it is unlocked early, it may be hard to increase the [Appeal%20%28Civ6%29](Appeal) of [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles), as you will likely be unable to plant [Woods%20%28Civ6%29](Woods) early on. Limit adjacent [Mine%20%28Civ6%29](Mines) and districts that lower Appeal (like [Industrial%20Zone%20%28Civ6%29](Industrial Zones)) while clearing nearby [Marsh%20%28Civ6%29](Marshes) and [Rainforest%20%28Civ6%29](Rainforests) to raise Appeal. Adjacent [Holy%20Site%20%28Civ6%29](Holy Sites) also help raise Appeal, and can simultaneously benefit from any nearby Woods.
This building, together with the Preserve, is amazing for [Tundra%20%28Civ6%29](Tundra) [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities). Appeal-lowering features ([Floodplains%20%28Civ6%29](Floodplains), Rainforests, and Marshes) cannot spawn on Tundra, but Woods can. This means Tundra areas generally have higher average Appeal than other biomes. The Grove is great since it adds to Tundra (especially flat featureless Tundra tiles, which cannot be improved otherwise), alleviating the growth issues these cities often face.
When playing as the [Incan%20%28Civ6%29](Inca), the boosted yields apply to [Mountains%20%28Civ6%29](Mountains), which players are normally unable to work. Water tiles receive bonuses from the Grove only if they are part of a [Natural%20wonder%20%28Civ6%29](natural wonder) (since they have no Appeal otherwise).
