# Food Modules (CTP1)

 is a [List%20of%20improvements%20%28CTP1%29](tile improvement) in "Civilization: Call to Power".
Gameplay.
Food modules are elaborate, medium-sized, space-based farms which use improved space technologies to create +40 when worked. This improvement costs 1400 PW and takes two turns to build in space.
Great Library entry.
Food modules sustained the early stages of space exploration and development. However, as space colonization began during the 21st century, scientists realized the need for more efficient farming methods. Research into asteroid farming and non-atmospheric photosynthesis provided the answer. In 2051 farmers harvested the first genetically-altered, high-yield crops in space.
