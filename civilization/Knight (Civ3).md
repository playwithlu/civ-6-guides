# Knight (Civ3)

Knights are fast and powerful. They are the first armored unit, and good at attack and defense. Knights
will withdraw from combat if they are losing (unless fighting another fast unit).
A city must have both [Iron%20%28Civ3%29](iron) and [Horses%20%28Civ3%29](horses) in its Strategic Resource box to build knights.
