# Stone (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Quarried stone was a vital building material for all cultures in the Mediterranean basin. Enormous blocks of
limestone and granite were culled from the earth by driving wedges into the rock until pieces split away.
Thousands of workers were used to haul these stones to the work sites.
