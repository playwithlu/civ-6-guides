# Electricity (Civ6)

Electricity is a [Modern%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Modern Era) [Technologies%20%28Civ6%29](technology) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It can be hurried by owning 3 [Privateer%20%28Civ6%29](Privateers) (2 Privateers in ""). 
Strategy.
Among the things which allow modern life few are as omnipresent as electricity. The discovery of an energy medium which is so universal that is capable of being used in large factories as well as in miniature nanomodules is indeed life-changing. It becomes possible after steam power proves the infinite possibilities of such universal powers; and after its discovery, electricity quickly displaces steam power. It is, after all, much cleaner, much less dangerous, and potentially more powerful. 
Electricity enables the latest advances in production infrastructure of cities: the [Power%20Plant%20%28Civ6%29](Power Plant), which produces it in large quantities from the [Industrial%20Zone%20%28Civ6%29](Industrial Zone), and the [Seaport%20%28Civ6%29](Seaport), which utilizes it for logistics operations and large sea vessels construction in the [Harbor%20%28Civ6%29](Harbor). Next, a revolutionary new ship becomes possible, thanks to this new source of energy - the [Submarine%20%28Civ6%29](Submarine). But there are many more contemporary advancements which will be impossible without electricity, among them something we cannot imagine the modern world without - the computer.
