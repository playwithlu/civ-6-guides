# Modernized Trap (Civ6)

The Modernized Trap is a special [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](tile improvement) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is exclusive to the [Zombie%20Defense%20%28Civ6%29](Zombie Defense) [Game%20mode%20%28Civ6%29](game mode), introduced in the [Portugal%20Pack%20%28Civ6%29](Portugal Pack). It can be built by a [Military%20Engineer%20%28Civ6%29](Military Engineer) on any [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tile) inside your own or neutral [Territory%20%28Civ6%29](territory).
Strategy.
The Modernized Trap is one of the two late-game defenses used in the Zombie Defense game mode. In contrast with the [Reinforced%20Barricade%20%28Civ6%29](Reinforced Barricade), which does moderate damage in a wide area, the Modernized Trap deals significant damage on one tile and slows down [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](units).
Unlike the [Trap%20%28Civ6%29](Trap) upon which it improves, the Modernized Trap is built by a Military Engineer, making it generally more expensive to create. Its damage output is fairly low, but is not dependent on the Strength of the enemy unit. This makes this weapon much more useful against enemies with very high strength, such as [Zombie%20%28Civ6%29](Zombies) with a high Mutation Strength Modifier. Generally, though, players will have access to other means of defeating Zombies at this point in the game.
