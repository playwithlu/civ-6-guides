# Mead Halls (Civ6)/Civilopedia

The ancient Scandinavian mead halls from the 5th through 11th centuries were combination tribal feasting chambers and occasional residences of Viking lords and their retainers. Norse sagas and legends are full of the many uses to which a mead hall could be putâ€”celebrations, ceremonies, festivals, war councils ... even murder! (The 'Ynglinga' saga recounts King Ingjald's construction of a mead hall in which to burn his subordinates as they slept.) The Vikings couldn't get enough of their mead halls, for the mythical halls of Valhalla and Sessrumnir allowed let their fun continue even after death.
