# Government (CTP2)

Government describes how a [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20CTP2](civilization) is run in "[Call%20to%20Power%20II](Call to Power II)". There are twelve different forms of government in the game (including [Anarchy%20%28CTP2%29](Anarchy), which is less a form of government than a state of chaos that exists between governments), each of which can be adopted once the appropriate [List%20of%20advances%20in%20CTP2](advance) has been discovered and has unique effects on a civilization's growth, production, science, gold, and military, as well as its citizens' loyalty and concern for the environment.
Certain governments enable special [List%20of%20units%20%28CTP2%29](units) that cannot be built under any other form of government. The [Cleric%20%28CTP2%29](Cleric), for example, can only exist under a [Theocracy%20%28government%29%20%28CTP2%29](Theocracy). Any of these special units you build can only exist under the government in which they were built. When you enact a new form of government, all of these special units will automatically disband and disappear from the game. For example, all Clerics created under a Theocracy will be lost when you switch to a [Republic%20%28CTP2%29](Republic).
