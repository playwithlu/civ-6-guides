Civilopedia entry.
As kingdoms and empires grew, it became increasingly difficult for the ruler to
maintain control over the more distant segments of the realm. To insure that
the far-flung cities of the empire contributed their expected share to the
coffers, local magistrates and courts were established. In the Courthouse the
ruler's representatives listened to the grievances of the people and meted out
justice. Here the laws that governed social interaction were defined and
enforced. The Courthouse reduced crime, and thereby kept the local population
productive and content. Unhappy and unproductive citizens were not willing
taxpayers.
