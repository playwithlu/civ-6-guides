Summary.
Optics, the third Physical Science Advance, reveals the true positions of the Earth and Sun, overturning centuries of geocentricism, that falsely placed man at the center of the universe. With Galileo's Telescope, a Civilization's knowledge increases as tangible evidence and verifiable calculations are gathered.
Great Library entry.
The Mechanical Clock and its focus on God's perfect machine inspired scientists to chart the stars with increasing accuracy. This required two steps of observation: timing and measurement. The pendulum clock provided timing, and the new Optics provided the measurement. The study of Optics was necessary for astronomical study. Although some speculate that the need for more accurate artillery sights and for better navigation aids were the true motivations for Optic research, regardless of the cause, the new vision overturned man's view of the world.
