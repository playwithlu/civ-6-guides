# Seven Seas (Civ6)

 is the second [Challenge%20of%20the%20month%20%28Civ6%29](challenge of the month) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)", running from December 12, 2023 to January 9, 2024.
Description.
The continents have been consumed by oceans. Civilizations persist, scattered across the mountainous islands that remain, but for some it will prove nigh impossible to thrive in this unfamiliar environment.
Playing as the Norwegian leader Harald Hardrada, you find yourself at an advantage. You've already explored most of the ocean, your Viking Longships are unrivaled in naval combat, and you have the unique ability to pillage your enemies' coastal tiles. During the Seven Seas challenge, played in Heroes &amp; Legends mode, the victory condition you pursue is entirely up to you. That sea air sure smells like Domination, though!
Intro.
Take to the seas as Harald Hardrada in this Challenge of the Month! Explore small, mountainous island chains in a vast ocean as you bring peace or ruin to distant lands. Will you charter a merchant fleet that carries bountiful resources from the water, or build a navy to dominate trade routes connecting the world?
As the classical era dawns, your people have already charted maps of most of the world's seas. As Viking tales of glory and victory empower your civilization, you'll be able to recruit heroes of legend. But the water provides its bounty not just to you - the people of the island world have discovered ways beyond your imagination to reap benefits from the rivers, beaches, lakes, and depths. Will you allow another to rise to prominence in your place?
Strategy.
You have three different [Victory%20%28Civ6%29](victory) conditions you can pursue in this challenge: [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Domination](Domination), [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Religion](Religious), and [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Diplomacy](Diplomatic). As Harald Hardrada, your [List%20of%20leader%20abilities%20in%20Civ6](leader) and [List%20of%20civilization%20abilities%20in%20Civ6](civilization abilities) and [Unique%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](unique units) steer you toward a Domination Victory, as does starting in an [Era%20%28Civ6%29](era) when you reach your power spike: explore the surrounding islands, train [Viking%20Longship%20%28Civ6%29](Viking Longships) and [Berserker%20%28Civ6%29](Berserkers) en masse, capture your closest neighbor's , heal and upgrade your [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](units) as necessary, and repeat until you win.
There are, however, additional factors at play in this challenge that make the other paths to victory viable. The [Stave%20Church%20%28Civ6%29](Stave Church), with its bonuses to and improved [Adjacency%20bonus%20%28Civ6%29](adjacency bonuses) from [Woods%20%28Civ6%29](Woods), helps generate both the you need to purchase [Missionary%20%28Civ6%29](Missionaries) and [Apostle%20%28Civ6%29](Apostles) (or land [Military%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](military units), with the [Grand%20Master%27s%20Chapel%20%28Civ6%29](Grand Master's Chapel)) and the you need to build your army and navy, especially in conjunction with the [God%20of%20the%20Sea%20%28Civ6%29](God of the Sea) [Pantheon%20%28Civ6%29](pantheon). On Prince [Difficulty%20level%20%28Civ6%29](difficulty), you have a good shot at founding the world's first [Religion%20%28Civ6%29](religion) and being able to select the most impactful [Beliefs%20%28Civ6%29](beliefs) if you build a [Holy%20Site%20%28Civ6%29](Holy Site) early on and run [Holy%20Site%20Prayers%20%28Civ6%29](Holy Site Prayers); on Emperor difficulty, however, you probably won't be the first to found one because of the [AI](AI) [Leaders%20%28Civ6%29](leaders') innate bonuses. You can then send your [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Religious](religious units) - which can embark and disembark without expending thanks to [Norwegian%20%28Civ6%29](Norway's) civilization ability - across the seas to convert your opponents' [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) and edge closer to a Religious Victory. You should also prioritize building the [Mahabodhi%20Temple%20%28Civ6%29](Mahabodhi Temple) if you choose to focus on religion, both for the free Apostles and the Diplomatic Victory points (which will help you pivot to a Diplomatic Victory if winning a Religious Victory becomes impractical).
The best [Government%20%28Civ6%29](governments) and [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](policy cards) to use will be heavily dependent on your strategy, but anything that gives bonuses to the production of [Naval%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](naval units) should be a high priority. The large amount of coastline on the [Map%20%28Civ6%29](map) coupled with Norway's other unique components gives you a good incentive to build lots of [Coastal%20%28Civ6%29](coastal) cities and [Harbor%20%28Civ6%29](Harbors), which makes [Merchant%20Republic%20%28Civ6%29](Merchant Republic), [Veterancy%20%28Civ6%29](Veterancy), [Naval%20Infrastructure%20%28Civ6%29](Naval Infrastructure), [Economic%20Union%20%28Civ6%29](Economic Union), and any policy card that increases yields hugely beneficial.
Lastly, the [Heroes%20%26amp%3B%20Legends%20%28Civ6%29](Heroes &amp; Legends) [Game%20mode%20%28Civ6%29](game mode) presents some unique tactical possibilities in this challenge. Heroes such as [Beowulf%20%28Civ6%29](Beowulf), [Hercules%20%28Civ6%29](Hercules), and [Sinbad%20%28Civ6%29](Sinbad) are good picks for obvious reasons (especially when pursuing a Domination Victory), but [Maui%20%28Civ6%29](Maui) also shines here: have him use Maui's Inventions to create [Resource%20%28Civ6%29](resources) in neutral [Coast%20%28Civ6%29](Coast) and [Lake%20%28Civ6%29](Lake) [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles), found a city nearby, and build a Holy Site and a Stave Church in the city to turn it into a powerhouse. Doing this before you discover [Steel%20%28Civ6%29](Steel) can also help you pinpoint where water-based sources of are, since Maui's Inventions can't overwrite unrevealed [Resource%20%28Civ6%29%23Strategic](strategic resources).
