# Civilizations (Civ2)

"[Civilization%20II](Civilization II)" features 21 playable civilizations. It includes the original fourteen civs from "[Sid%20Meier%27s%20Civilization](Sid Meier's Civilization)" and introduces seven new cultures, increasing the total number of civs per color group to three.
Color groups.
As in the original "Civilization", civs are grouped into one of seven colors (plus s). A civilization's color determines its order of action during the [turn](turn): White acts first and Purple acts last, with the barbarians following after all other civs.
Only one civ of each color group can be present on the at a time, meaning a maximum of seven playable civs will be active in any game. A game that has less than seven active civs can spawn additional players through s. If not disabled in [New%20game%20%28Civ2%29%23Custom%20rules](custom rules), when a civ is vanquished, a new civ of the same color group can appear in unclaimed territory; it begins with the standard and few, if any, s.
Leaders.
Each civilization has one male and one female leader, represented by a stylized portrait in the screen. Depending on the user's [Game%20settings%20%28Civ2%29%23Graphic%20options](settings), the portrait is accompanied by an animated herald dressed in the civ's livery. Unlike the original "Civilization", a leader's titles can vary by gender ("King" vs. "Queen"), and several leaders have custom titles under specific governments (e.g., a Japanese is a , and a German is a ).
Personality.
A civilization's [AI](artificial intelligence) is guided by preset personality traits, similar to [Civilization%20%28Civ1%29%23Personality](those featured in the original "Civilization"). These are coded as part of the civilization, and do not vary between individual leaders. Each civ has three personality traits, each with three possible values (two weighted, and a neutral or "balanced" middle):
City styles.
Civilizations are categorized into one of four culture groups that determine the appearance of sprites in the [Ancient%20World%20%28Civ2%29](Ancient) and s. These are:
Modding.
During , the user can customize their leader name and gender, the civilization's name, and their government titles. They may also select an alternative city style.
The [Modding%20%28Civ2%29/Rules](rules.txt) file includes definitions for the s and s, with accompanying city names in [Modding%20%28Civ2%29/Cities%23City%20names](cities.txt). They are not recognized in the base game, but their code can be substituted for any existing civ; note that neither features custom leader portraits, and will use those of whichever civ they replace.
