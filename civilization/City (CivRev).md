# City (CivRev)

A city is where [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20CivRev](civilization) is built. It is your most important asset in "[Civilization%20Revolution](Civilization Revolution)". In cities, you will build your [Production%20%28CivRev%29](production) (which allows the construction of [Building%20%28CivRev%29](buildings), [Settlers%20%28CivRev%29](Settlers), and military units), produce your [Culture%20%28CivRev%29](culture), and research new [List%20of%20technologies%20in%20CivRev](technologies). Without cities, your people are just another bunch of [Barbarian%20%28CivRev%29](Barbarians) with no future.
