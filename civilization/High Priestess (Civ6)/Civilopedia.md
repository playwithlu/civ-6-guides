# High Priestess (Civ6)/Civilopedia

High priestesses upheld religious traditions and maintained the temples along the Nile. They held significant sway among the Nile people, at times having more power than Nubian royal lines and Egyptian dynasties. Later rulers would learn not to put the bulk of the countryâ€™s wealth in buildings controlled by the priesthood.
