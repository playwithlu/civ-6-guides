# Specialists (Civ6)

Specialists are alternative work assignments for Citizens, in which they do not work in the open field (meaning the [Terrain%20%28Civ6%29](terrain) [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles) surrounding their [City%20%28Civ6%29](city)), but in their city's [Building%20%28Civ6%29](buildings). In "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)", all buildings with Specialist slots are concentrated in s. After you construct a district in a city, you will start populating it with the relevant buildings, which in turn will open up Specialist slots where you can assign Specialists. Another difference with the previous game is that Specialists now provide yields only and not Points, which makes them somewhat less important.
As a general rule, specialists are a good way to get yields otherwise hard to find on normal tiles, but the city needs a solid support base of to support them in the long term. Specialists are also particularly useful when a city grows large later in the game, and has more Population than there are normal tiles to work.
There are different types of specialists, each providing different benefits. Note, however, that there is an upper limit of 3 on any Specialist type, since every city can have only a single district of each type, and each district may house up to three buildings.
Note that [Combat%20%28Civ6%29%23Pillaging](Pillaging) district buildings will also destroy their Specialist slots; it won't, however, kill the Citizens working there.
