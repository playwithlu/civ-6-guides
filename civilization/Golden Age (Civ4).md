# Golden Age (Civ4)

In "[Civilization%20IV](Civilization IV)", a Golden Age is a sequence of turns in which a [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ4](civilization) gains bonuses to [Production%20%28Civ4%29](production). Players often abbreviate Golden Age as GA, which is unfortunately the same abbreviation as is used for [Great%20Artist%20%28Civ4%29](Great Artists). Which one is meant should be clear from context.
Triggering a Golden Age.
There are two ways to initiate a Golden Age. One is via building the [Taj%20Mahal%20%28Civ4%29](Taj Mahal), possible with the [Nationalism%20%28Civ4%29](Nationalism) [List%20of%20technologies%20in%20Civ4](tech). Upon completion of the [List%20of%20wonders%20in%20Civ4](wonder), a Golden Age commences.
The other way to begin a Golden Age is by using [Great%20Person%20%28Civ4%29](Great People).
They must be of different types. To trigger a Golden Age with Great People, move them together. Then you will see the "Trigger Golden Age" button is active when you select one. You can click it to initiate the Golden Age; note that the effects begin immediately.
Duration.
A Golden Age lasts for 8 turns (on Normal [Speed%20%28Civ4%29](speed)), or 12 turns if you own the [Mausoleum%20of%20Maussollos%20%28Civ4%29](Mausoleum of Maussollos). The following table shows how many turns a Golden Age lasts on each game speed.
If a second Golden Age is triggered during a Golden Age, additional turns (as per the table above) are added to the ongoing one at the end.
Effects.
When a civ is in a Golden Age, the following effects apply to it:
The player is notified by the message "(Leader name)'s Golden Age has just begun." at the start of a Golden Age, and by the message "(Leader name)'s Golden Age has ended." at its conclusion.
