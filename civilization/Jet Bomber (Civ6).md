Strategy.
Jet Bombers are invaluable units in Information Era warfare. Using normal bombing runs, Jet Bombers can quickly wear down a [City%20%28Civ6%29](city's) defenses, allowing the city to be taken easily. If necessary, a Jet Bomber is also capable of performing a Nuclear or Thermonuclear Strike, which will instantly destroy the defenses of any cities caught within the blast radius. Like Bombers, Jet Bombers are still vulnerable to [Anti-Air%20Gun%20%28Civ6%29](Anti-Air Guns), [Mobile%20SAM%20%28Civ6%29](Mobile SAMs), patrolling fighters, a select few [Naval%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](naval units), and (in "Gathering Storm") [Giant%20Death%20Robot%20%28Civ6%29](Giant Death Robots).
When delivering [Nuclear%20weapons%20%28Civ6%29](nuclear weapons), the attack will fail and the nuke will be lost if the Jet Bomber falls below 50% [HP](HP) during an interception, so always make sure your Jet Bomber is in good health and the anti-air defenses are cleared before delivering a nuclear payload.
Bugs.
In the iOS versions of the game, using the Jet Bomber to attack causes a visual glitch to occur where the screen freezes before the animation finishes. However, the game itself continues to run. This glitch can be avoided by swiping the screen away from the attack's animation before it happens.
