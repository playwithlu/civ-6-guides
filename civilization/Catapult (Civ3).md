# Catapult (Civ3)

Primitive artillery, catapults are devastating siege weapons in Ancient Times. They are used to
bombard city defenses to soften the attack for accompanying soldiers. Catapults have no attack or defense power, so they should be protected by an escort. Finally, they are wheeled so they may not enter mountains or jungles unless following a road.
