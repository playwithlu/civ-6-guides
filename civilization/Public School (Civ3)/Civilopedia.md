# Public School (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Napoleon was a firm believer in education for the masses. In fact, one of his lesser
known claims to fame is his establishment of uniform public education. Under his
regime countless public schools were established throughout France. According to
Napoleon, "Until one learns from infancy whether it is necessary to be republican or
monarchist, Catholic or atheist, etc., the State will not form a nation; it will rest
on uncertain and vague foundations; it will be constantly exposed to disorders and
changes."
