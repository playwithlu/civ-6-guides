# Polyperchon (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Polyperchon commanded a phalanx under Alexander until the time of his kingâ€™s death, though he is better known for his involvement in the subsequent succession wars. Successfully navigating the constantly shifting loyalties during at least three wars of the Diadochi, Polyperchon was thought to have survived through the 3rd Century BCE.
