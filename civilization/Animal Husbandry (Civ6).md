# Animal Husbandry (Civ6)

Reveals {{Horses6}}. ({{GS}})
Animal Husbandry is an [Ancient%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Ancient Era) [Technologies%20%28Civ6%29](technology) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
Animal Husbandry is a vital stepping stone for civilizations, enabling access to animal resources outside the [City%20Center%20%28Civ6%29](City Center) via [Pasture%20%28Civ6%29](Pastures) and [Camp%20%28Civ6%29](Camps). It also allows Harvesting of all these resources. In "", {{Horses6}} are revealed with Animal Husbandry instead of being visible at the beginning of the game, which makes researching this technology as early as possible even more essential. In fact, most of the time Animal Husbandry should be one of the two starting choices of tech research (along with Mining) - you should prioritize it if there are any nearby resources accessible with one of the [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](improvements) it unlocks.
