Great Library entry.
Although in the 26th century, the discovery of mind control opened new avenues for governmental control, inevitably, the early projects to control human labor and productivity failed. Despite using mind control to exercise dominion over people's desires to chat, surf the Net, and sometimes just plain old goof off, mind control was not effective at maintaining productivity under more extreme conditions such as fire or physical pain. The AI Entity solved this. With a versatile and adaptable system, the AI Entity linked each of its human cells through an embedded control chip. At the first sign of discontent, the AI Entity could send gentle electrical impulses to the chip resulting in a pleasant numbing sensation and a desire to do whatever the AI Entity deemed efficient. Productivity skyrocketed and psychiatry plummeted as happiness was just an electrical impulse away.
