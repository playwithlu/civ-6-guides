# Artillery (Civ1)

An Artillery is a late-game unit that specializes in offense and its defense is comparable to that of a Phalanx.
Strategy.
Artillery has the highest attack strength of all land units in the game (12) but a low defense (2). It is useful for attack but should be backed by Riflemen or other strong defenders. It can move after it attacks and should immediately retreat (after attacking) when faced by something with an attack strength equal to or greater than a legion. The Artillery can ignore the effects of city walls, making it extremely effective against cities.
Civilopedia entry.
Modern, self-propelled artillery is far more powerful and far more mobile than its muzzle-loading ancestors. Strong enough to batter opposing forces behind the strongest fortifications, it is also able to move from one firing position to another quickly, an important capability in a fluid battle or when avoiding counter-battery fire.
