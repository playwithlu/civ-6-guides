# Flank attack (CivBE)

A flank attack is any attack on a [Units%20%28CivBE%29](unit) adjacent to the attacker's units.
Some units get bonuses from making flanking attacks. This does "not" indicate a bonus given when attacking from behind or to the side of the target unit, as the term flanking might suggest.
