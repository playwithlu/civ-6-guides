# Warrior (Civ5)/Civilopedia

In primitive civilizations there's no such thing as a "professional soldier." A young civilization can't afford to support a full-time army; all of the civilization's able-bodied men form an ad hoc militia, coming together during a crisis, dispersing back to their farms and villages during peace. Such warriors usually have very little training and are equipped with the most primitive of weapons - clubs, perhaps, or stone daggers.
