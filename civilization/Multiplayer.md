# Multiplayer

Due to how long it takes to finish a multiplayer game, it requires a lot of patience for all those playing. Several factors determine how long such a game lasts, including the size of the [map](map), the number and schedules of people playing, how long it takes everyone to decide what to do each turn, and whether or not people try to stall the game instead of admitting defeat when they're losing and unable to recover.
