New methods of microscopy enabled doctors to know almost the entire structure of the human body by the beginning of the 19th century. Doctors, particularly in Germany, began to make considerably headway into the understanding of physiological processes. Under the guidance of Johannes MÃ¼ller, a professor at Bonn and the University of Berlin, Germany established physiology as a distinct science. He detailed his discoveries in his famous textbook, Handbuch der Physiologie des Menschen ("Manual of Human Physiology"), published in the 1830s.
Medicine developed further throughout the 1800s, as science and technology augmented medicine's efforts to uncover the mysteries of the human body and its various systems. Breakthroughs in pharmacology ushered in a new era of modern medicine in the early 1900s.
