# Celtic (Civ5)

The Celtic people (or Celts) represent a [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilization) in "".
Strategy.
One of the new civilizations added in the "Gods &amp; Kings" expansion, the Celts are one of the masters of [Religion%20%28Civ5%29](religion), and will typically be the first founders of a Pantheon (unless someone stumbles upon a [City-state%20%28Civ5%29%23Types%20of%20City-States](religious city-state) early on). Their unique ability produces from every [City%20%28Civ5%29](city) bordering an unimproved [Forest%20%28Civ5%29](forest), and their [Starting%20bias%20%28Civ5%29](starting bias) usually puts them in large forested areas. This means they can form a Pantheon as early as Turn 5. With careful placement of their first two or three [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities), they will be able to found a religion before Turn 30. As if that weren't enough, their unique replacement for the [Spearman%20%28Civ5%29](Spearman), the [Pictish%20Warrior%20%28Civ5%29](Pictish Warrior), generates  from each enemy [Unit%20%28Civ5%29](unit) it slays.
Of course, a good religion on its own doesn't resolve the game - try to form a strategy for the type of [Victory%20%28Civ5%29](victory) you want, and tailor your religion accordingly, then use its early formation to spread it as widely and as aggressively as you can. The Celts' [Unique%20building%20%28Civ5%29](unique building), the [Ceilidh%20Hall%20%28Civ5%29](Ceilidh Hall) - in addition to the bonuses of the [Opera%20House%20%28Civ5%29](Opera House) it replaces - gives them a nice boost to once they reach the [Renaissance%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Renaissance Era).
For general strategy, play the Celts as a religious civilization. The [Piety%20%28Civ5%29](Piety) tree is the best recommended [Social%20policies%20%28Civ5%29](social policy) tree for the Celts. In "", with the Piety tree being available right from the [Ancient%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Ancient Era), the Celts should be able to get the edge even more easily.
Note that [Road%20%28Civ5%29](roads) and [Railroad%20%28improvement%29%20%28Civ5%29](railroads) do "not" count as an improvement; forest tiles with these will still give the bonus.
