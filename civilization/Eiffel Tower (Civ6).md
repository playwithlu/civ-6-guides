# Eiffel Tower (Civ6)

The Eiffel Tower is a {{Link6|Modern Era}} {{Link6|Wonder}} in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It must be built on flat land adjacent to a {{Link6|City Center}}.
Strategy.
The Eiffel Tower's bonus is immensely useful to players who are aiming for a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Culture Victory). The simplest use of this wonder for any cultural [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) is to buff their [Seaside%20Resort%20%28Civ6%29](Seaside Resorts); the Eiffel Tower increases each Seaside Resort's {{Tourism6}} by 2 and grants an extra 2 {{Gold6}} while also enabling new Seaside Resort locations that would not be possible without it. Players looking to use this strategy should also prioritize [Cristo%20Redentor%20%28Civ6%29](Cristo Redentor), which doubles the {{Tourism6}} output of all Seaside Resorts.
[National%20Park%20%28Civ6%29](National Parks) are also improved by the Eiffel Tower. As National Parks grant {{Tourism6}} equal to the total [Appeal%20%28Civ6%29](Appeal) of the tiles inside them, building the Eiffel Tower will grant each of its owner's National Parks +8 {{Tourism6}} per turn. Note that [Mountains%20%28Civ6%29](Mountains) and [Natural%20wonder%20%28Civ6%29](natural wonders) also receive +2 Appeal from the Eiffel Tower, so National Parks that include these tiles and [Ski%20Resort%20%28Civ6%29](Ski Resorts) always fully benefit from this wonder.
If you were able to found the [Earth%20Goddess%20%28Civ6%29](Earth Goddess) [Pantheon%20%28Civ6%29](pantheon), construction of the Eiffel Tower is sure to increase your {{Faith6}} output from the extra Breathtaking tiles created. While the extra {{Faith6}} is likely to come too late to aid in a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Religious](Religious Victory), it will make it easier to purchase [Naturalist%20%28Civ6%29](Naturalists) and [Rock%20Band%20%28Civ6%29](Rock Bands) to increase your {{Tourism6}}.
Aside from Culture Victory seekers, there are a few civilizations that reap particularly great benefits from the Eiffel Tower even without Cristo Redentor:
