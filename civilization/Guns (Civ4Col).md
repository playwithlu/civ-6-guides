# Guns (Civ4Col)

To construct Guns, you must first have Tools available and have an [Armory%20%28Civ4Col%29](Armory), [Magazine%20%28Civ4Col%29](Magazine), or [Arsenal%20%28Civ4Col%29](Arsenal) building. If you have Tools, you can assign a unit to the [Master%20Gunsmith%20%28Civ4Col%29](Gunsmith) profession; that unit will immediately begin turning tools into Guns.
