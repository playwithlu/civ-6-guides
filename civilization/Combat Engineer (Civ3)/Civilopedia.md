# Combat Engineer (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Most infantry divisions of WWII had a subunit (usually battalion) of engineers specially trained for a
variety of tasks, such as bridge-building, road repair or assaulting fortifications. When equipped for combat,
the engineers would pack many special weapons: lots of automatic weapons, flamethrowers, satchel charges of TNT,
and perhaps even bangalore torpedoes. This explosive combination of offensive firepower made the combat engineer a
much-feared weapon. In the Pacific Theatre U.S. Combat Engineers armed with flamethrowers and demolition charges
were the preferred weapon when attacking stubborn Nipponese infantry burrowed
deep into caves in the side of hills.
