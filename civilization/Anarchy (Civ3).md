# Anarchy (Civ3)

Anarchy is not so much a system of [Government%20%28Civ3%29](government) as the lack of one. Your [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ3](civilization) can sink into anarchy if the government falls from prolonged [Civil%20disorder%20%28Civ3%29](civil disorder), or if you sanction a [Revolution%20%28Civ3%29](revolution). Anarchy seldom lasts longer than a few turns. But during that period [Corruption%20%28Civ3%29](corruption and waste) are so high that no production occurs and no taxes are collected; scientific research comes to a halt, as well. There is no [Improvement%20%28Civ3%29](improvement) maintenance when a civilization is in Anarchy.
