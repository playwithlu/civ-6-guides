# Llamas (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Llamas were (and still are) very important to Andean culture. The Incas used llamas to portage goods across the steep Andes Mountains, and used their course wool to make sacks and rope. Llamas were also a meat source, and were sacrificed to the gods during religious ceremonies.
