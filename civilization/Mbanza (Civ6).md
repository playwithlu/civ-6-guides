Thanks to the Mbanza, the Kongolese can start building populous, prosperous [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) as early as the [Medieval%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Medieval Era).

Additionally, [Mvemba%20a%20Nzinga%20%28Civ6%29](Mvemba a Nzinga's) [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader ability) will cause an [Apostle%20%28Civ6%29](Apostle) of the city's dominant [Religion%20%28Civ6%29](religion) (if present) to spawn when a Mbanza finishes construction. Take advantage of this to spread religions that are most beneficial as you grow your cities.
