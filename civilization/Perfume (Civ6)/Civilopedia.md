# Perfume (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Fragrant oils mixed with solvents and fixatives have been used by civilized man for millennia, because people sometimes smell. Ancient records and the findings of modern archeologists confirm the use of perfumes of various sorts – made from plants, animal parts, and even some minerals – since the first human settlements. The modern perfume industry, tracing its roots to the 14th Century Arabia and France, expanded aroma compounds with ever new concoctions. Maybe if they had known that perfumes can cause asthmatic attacks, allergic skin reactions, headaches or nausea, they wouldn’t have.
