# Desert (Civ1)

Deserts are generally useless when unimproved, but can be beneficial if strategically improved.
Some [Production%20%28Civ1%29](resources) are present that can be [Improvements%20%28Civ1%29](mined), food can be produced if the desert is [Improvements%20%28Civ1%29](irrigated), and [Improvements%20%28Civ1%29](roads) generate some [Trade%20%28Civ1%29](trade).
Deserts produce 1 resource. Irrigation adds 1 [Food%20%28Civ1%29](food), mines add another shield and road adds 1 trade arrow.
[Oasis%20%28Civ1%29](Oases) can be found in deserts, generating an extra 3 food.
It costs 1 Movement Point to travel over a Desert region, and you get no defensive bonus.
Excessive [Pollution%20%28Civ1%29](pollution) in the world can cause plains and grasslands to become desert.
