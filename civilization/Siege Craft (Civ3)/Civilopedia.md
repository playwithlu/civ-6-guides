# Siege Craft (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Siege engines were a favorite of the Romans. Their primary purpose was to bombard the interior of a
defended position, wrecking the buildings and killing, injuring and demoralizing the occupants. There
were basically two types of siege engines: the catapult (sometimes called a mangonel), and the ballista,
a type of massive crossbow. Eventually, early artillerists learned to fashion incendiary missiles, such
as heated stones and jars of “Greek Fire”. Invented by the Greeks but perfected by the Romans, siege
engines continued to be used well into the Middle Ages (when the trebuchet was introduced), and even
into the gunpowder age.
