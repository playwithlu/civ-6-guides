# Feudal Contract (Civ6)

Feudal Contract is a Military [Policy%20Cards%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
This Military Policy practically replaces [Agoge%20%28Civ6%29](Agoge). Use it as you would the previous one: to accelerate construction of next-gen [Units%20%28Civ6%29](units), such as [Crossbowman%20%28Civ6%29](Crossbowmen) and [Musketman%20%28Civ6%29](Musketmen).
Sometimes you will have already amassed a big enough army in the first two [Era%20%28Civ6%29](eras). In this case you won't need Feudal Contract that much, as all you will actually need to do is upgrade your existing units.
