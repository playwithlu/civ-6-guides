# Jebel Barkal (Civ6)

Jebel Barkal is a in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It must be built on [Desert%20%28Hills%29%20%28Civ6%29](Desert Hills).
Strategy.
Jebel Barkal is beneficial to both religious and militaristic civilizations. It is particularly useful with [Theocracy%20%28Civ6%29](Theocracy) (or the [Grand%20Master%27s%20Chapel%20%28Civ6%29](Grand Master's Chapel) in ""), since it allows nearby cities to generate that can be used to purchase [Units%20%28Civ6%29](units) and the it provides will enable all of the owner's cities to produce [Swordsman%20%28Civ6%29](Swordsmen) and [Knight%20%28Civ6%29](Knights). The maximum amount of you can get out of this Wonder is 52 , including the city it is built in and 12 surrounding cities within a 6 tile radius (so that you satisfy the 3-tile apart rule between every two cities, for more visualization, check [Mayan%20%28Civ6%29%23Strategy](here)); however, don't go out of your way to sacrifice Fresh Water access and growing space just to get a little bit more . This Wonder can provide a strong generation early game, which is helpful for civilizations with Religious tendency, but sometimes the main challenge is to find a Desert Hills tile when your civilization does not have Desert starting bias like [Nubian%20%28Civ6%29](Nubia) or [Malian%20%28Civ6%29](Mali). The [Mayan%20%28Civ6%29](Maya), despite having no religious tendency, can also make use of this Wonder, since they always try to pack as many cities as possible around their without having to worry about Fresh Water access. The extra is welcome, but it is already very abundant as a Strategic Resource, and becomes obsolete in warfare quite quickly.
