# Minerals (SMAC)

Minerals are used for building [Unit%20%28SMAC%29](units), [Base%20facilities%20%28SMAC%29](Base facilities), [Secret%20Projects%20%28SMAC%29](Secret Projects), maintaining units, or reconverted into [Energy%20Credits%20%28SMAC%29](Energy Credits) through [Stockpile%20Energy%20%28SMAC%29](Stockpile Energy).
Mineral costs are calculated into "rows", which varies depending on the [Industry%20%28SMAC%29](INDUSTRY) rating of the [Factions%20%28SMAC%29](faction).
An industrial rating of 0 (normal) makes a Mineral row costs 10 Minerals.
+1 (10% decrease) makes a Mineral row costs 9 Minerals.
-1 (10% increase) makes a Mineral row costs 11 Minerals.
