# National Identity (Civ6)

National Identity is a Military [Policy%20Cards%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
National Identity reduces the Combat Strength penalty that damaged [Units%20%28Civ6%29](units) suffer. It can be useful when you're fighting a prolonged war and it's tactically unsound to stop advancing and wait for your units to heal, or if you're on the defensive and your units need to hold off the enemy until you can move, train, or purchase reinforcements.
