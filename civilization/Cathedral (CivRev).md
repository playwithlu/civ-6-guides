Civilopedia entry.
Cathedrals are large, majestic religious buildings created by the faithful to display their devotion to their religion. Far bigger than mere temples, cathedrals may take decades - generations, even - to complete. (Note that the term "Cathedral" is used here to denote any especially impressive religious structure: the Buddhist "Great Stupa," for example, or the Islamic "Kaaba" in Mecca.)
