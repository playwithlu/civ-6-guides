# Civil Service (Civ5)

Game Info.
Civil Service, the creation of the first true state organ (besides the army, of course), provides many benefits related with better organization: production from [Farm%20%28Civ5%29](Farms) in tiles next to fresh water is increased, and soldiers become better organized, resulting in the creation of the [Pikeman%20%28Civ5%29](Pikeman), an advanced frontline unit of the [Medieval%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Medieval Era).
In "", Civil Service also allows signing of [Diplomacy%20%28Civ5%29%23Open%20borders](Open borders) treaties.
After the [Fall%202013%20patch%20%28Civ5%29](Fall 2013 patch) of "", the [Landsknecht%20%28Civ5%29](Landsknecht) is also unlocked by this tech. (Note that you also need the [Mercenary%20Army%20%28Civ5%29](Mercenary Army) [Social%20policies%20%28Civ5%29](social policy) to get that [Unit%20%28Civ5%29](unit).)
