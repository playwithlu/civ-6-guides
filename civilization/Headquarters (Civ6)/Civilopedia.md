# Headquarters (Civ6)/Civilopedia

The headquarters is the place where the operational plans of the army are put into orders for the field. Connected to subordinate commanders along the battle line through messengers and telegraph, these are often temporary affairs, as the shifting battle lines require high command to stay close to the action.
