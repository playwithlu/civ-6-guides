# F8

"F8" is the eighth "function key" at the top of most computer keyboards. Most games covered by this wiki use it to display something. Early keyboards had only eight function keys, which is why [Sid%20Meier%27s%20Civilization](Sid Meier's Civilization) has no higher numbers. Later games made use of higher function key numbers.
