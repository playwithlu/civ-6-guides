Intro.
Noble and virtuous Queen Maria Theresa, Holy Roman Empress and sovereign of Austria, your people bow to your gracious will. Following the death of your father, King Charles VI, you ascended to the throne of Austria during the time of great instability, but the empty coffers and diminished military did little to dissuade your ambitions. Faced with war almost immediately upon your succession to the throne, you managed to fend off your foes, and in naming your husband, Francis Stephen, co-ruler, assured your place as Empress of the Holy Roman Empire. During your reign, you guided Austria on a new path of reform - strengthening the military, replenishing the treasury, and improving the education system of the kingdom.
Oh great queen, bold and dignified, the time has come for you to rise and guide your kingdom once again. Can you return your people to the height of prosperity and splendor? Will you build a civilization that will stand the test of time?
