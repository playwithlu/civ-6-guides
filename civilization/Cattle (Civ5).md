# Cattle (Civ5)

Game Info.
Bonus resource.
Strategy.
 Cattle are found only on open [Grassland%20%28Civ5%29](Grassland) [Terrain%20%28Civ5%29](terrain), and as such are a great booster, providing 3 without any [List%20of%20improvements%20in%20Civ5](improvement). They allow you to build a [Stable%20%28Civ5%29](Stable) in a nearby [City%20%28Civ5%29](city); when combined with a [Pasture%20%28Civ5%29](Pasture), the tile also yields +2 .
