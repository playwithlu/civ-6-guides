# Wine (Civ6)

 Wine is a [Resource%20%28Civ6%29%23Luxury](luxury resource) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is found on both [Grassland%20%28Civ6%29](Grassland) and [Plains%20%28Civ6%29](Plains) [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles), and in [Woods%20%28Civ6%29](Woods).
Strategy.
With the [Goddess%20of%20Festivals%20%28Civ6%29](Goddess of Festivals) [Pantheon%20%28Civ6%29](pantheon), Wine provides an impressive +3 and +3 when improved. Even without this pantheon, its +2 bonus can help spur a city's growth.
