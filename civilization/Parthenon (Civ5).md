# Parthenon (Civ5)

Strategy.
The Parthenon is a wonder that automatically grants you a free [Great%20Work%20%28Civ5%29](Great Work of Art) (usually your first Great Work ever), allowing you to jump-start your and start gaining influence over the other players. This will likely be the only [Classical%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Classical) Great Work of Art in the game (if the wonder is built in this [Era%20%28Civ5%29](era)), which can help tremendously with getting your [Theming%20bonus%20%28Civ5%29](theming bonuses). All players pursuing a [Cultural%20victory%20%28Civ5%29](cultural victory) should try to build it.
Also, the +6 (+4 base, +2 with the Great Work) generated is significant at this point of the game, and a great help for early [Social%20policies%20%28Civ5%29](Social Policies).
