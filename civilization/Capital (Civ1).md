# Capital (Civ1)

The Capital in "[Sid%20Meier%27s%20Civilization](Sid Meier's Civilization)" is the primary [City%20%28Civ1%29](city) of your [Civilizations%20%28Civ1%29](civilization's) [empire](empire), characterized by the existence of its [Palace%20%28Civ1%29](Palace). If a civilization's capital falls, that civilization may go into [Civil%20war%20%28Civ1%29](civil war).
Capital functions.
The first city that your starting [Settlers%20%28Civ1%29](Settlers) [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ1](unit) has constructed becomes your Capital (with a free Palace), until you decide to build a new Palace in another city, which causes that city to replace your existing Capital, and your Palace to be moved to that city.
