Summary.

This formidable attacker has a strong bite, but cannot withstand a strong attack. Combined with its maximum cargo of two [Nuke%20%28CTP1%29](Nukes), the Submarine is the terror of the seas.
Great Library entry.
The first submarines operated as little more than manned torpedoes. By the 1900s however, European and American companies developed a number of improved submarine designs. Powered by electric or oil engines, these craft lacked the speed needed to hunt surface vessels. But in 1912 the Krupp firm introduced a diesel engine to its design, creating the dreaded German U-boat of WWI. Subsequent designs added larger engines and even later, nuclear power.
