Book synopsis.
The Believers find themselves at a disadvantage having the least advanced technology on the planet. They ally themselves with the [Human%20Hive%20%28SMAC%29](Human Hive), and go on a crusade to destroy or convert all other factions, mainly utilizing terrorism and sneak attacks. Meanwhile, the University of Planet has secretly created a person with the ability to change their internal and external composition at will, effectively adapting their body at will. The conflict culminates when the Believers create a gravitational singularity bomb, a weapon of mass destruction, and use them to completely destroy [Morgan%20Industries%20%28SMAC%29](Morgan Industries), and after an attempt to destroy the missiles by the [Spartan%20Federation%20%28SMAC%29](Spartan Federation), them too. Lady Deirdre Skye, Academician Prokhor Zakharov, and Pravin Lal hide under a deep mountain to live in a virtual reality world for the rest of their lives, and the planet's creatures rise up to destroy the remaining humans after the catastrophic damage to the planet caused by the singularity bombs.
