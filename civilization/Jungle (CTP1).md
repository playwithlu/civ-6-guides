# Jungle (CTP1)

Jungle is a type of [Terrain%20%28CTP1%29](terrain) in "".
Gameplay.
Jungles can support a {{LinkCTP1|city}} though the thick foliage makes navigation difficult. The jungle's foliage also prevents any {{LinkCTP1|farm}}ing or {{LinkCTP1|mining}}. On the other hand, the abundant plant-life creates a wealth of natural resources for {{LinkCTP1|production}} and provides a defensive bonus. {{LinkCTP1|Rivers}} greatly enhance this terrain.
Great Library entry.
Jungles account for only nine percent of the Earth's land surface, however these areas contain a third of the Earth's plant life and half of its animal life. Thick nets of trees and undergrowth make much of the land inaccessible; some isolated tribes in the Amazon remained hidden until the end of the 20th century.
