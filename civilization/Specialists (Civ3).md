# Specialists (Civ3)

It is sometimes necessary to fine-tune a city's production. To do so, you'll want specialists.
Specialists do not work in the city radius so they don't contribute to city production of food, shields, or commerce.
Instead, they produce extra happy faces, scientific research, or tax revenue.
To create one of these specialists, on the City Display, click any square currently being worked;
the production icons disappear and an Entertainer appears among the population. If you wanted an entertainer, you're done. 
If you wanted a different specialist, click on the entertainer to cycle through all the specialists.
The yields from specialists are not affected by bonuses such as those from city improvements, or penalties such as those from corruption and waste. For example, if you have a civil engineer in a city (which produces 2 shields) as well as a factory (which increases shields by 50%), the civil engineer will not have its shield contribution increased to 3 and will remain at 2 shields, and neither of the 2 shields will be wasted even if that city is experiencing a very high level of waste.
