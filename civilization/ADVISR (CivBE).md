The pop-up can be closed by choosing one of two buttons. The first is "Advice Only" and the second is "Full Guidance". Selecting "Advice Only" means ADVISR will only provide strategic advice based on situations the player encounters. If "Full Guidance" is selected, the player will be prompted with dialog boxes throughout the game introducing basic systems key to their progress in the game.
