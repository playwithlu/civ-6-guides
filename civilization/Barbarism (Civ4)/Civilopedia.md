# Barbarism (Civ4)/Civilopedia

Barbarism is the most primitive legal system. Under barbarism, the strong take what they want from the weak: their money, possessions, even spouses and children. Disputes are settled by combat; might is right.
There is little positive to say about barbarism, except perhaps that it cuts way back on red tape. It does not support a legal class that can complicate and obfuscate the law to ensure job security.
