Developed in the 1980s and successfully tested during the Persian Gulf War, the stealth bomber was the second airplane to employ stealth technology in the U.S. Air Force. Named the "Spirit," it combined advanced composite materials and coatings to absorb radar signals and minimize detection. Although the B-2 had a vast range and could carry both nuclear and conventional armament, its $1.3 billion price tag made it a difficult expense to justify in peacetime.
