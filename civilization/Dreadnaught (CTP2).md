Great Library entry.
The Dreadnaught was the most ingeniously designed military vehicle in history. One of the first watercraft to make use of smart materials, its exterior was comprised of a voluntarily elastic substance that enabled the dreadnaught to propel itself through water by mimicking the undulations of a sea creature. It could harden into a nearly impenetrable carapace of armor or languidly morph around a natural rock formation. It is capable of dramatic, chameleon-like camouflage techniques. When near the surface of the ocean, the dreadnaught's exterior would sense the light and selectively reflect only a fraction of the visible spectrum, making it barely visible to passing craft. Its arsenal included plasma weaponry and conventional torpedoes. The dreadnaught was unquestionably the zenith of military technology and the most feared ship in the world.
