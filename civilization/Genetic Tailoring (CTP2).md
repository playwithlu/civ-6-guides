Great Library entry.
Building on the monumental discoveries in the field of genetics over the first half of the 21st century, geneticists began to explore the world of gene synthesis and customization. Genetics enabled them to create life by copying existing genes, and gene therapy enabled them to alter existing genes and splice them into existing DNA. Genetic tailoring, pioneered by the Anthony D. Evans Genetics Research Laboratory, was a process by which geneticists fabricated genes from scratch, imbuing them with the code to produce specific attributes.
The first completely synthesized living organism was a butterfly with luminescent wings and a genetically programmed ability to respond to the human voice. Later, scientists began to create animals with built-in resistances to pesticides and toxins. The ultimate expression of genetic tailoring came when commercial ventures enabled people to design and customize their offspring. They could combine their own genetic material with tailored genes, or leave their DNA out of the process completely. Human beings now had the power to truly create any kind of life.
