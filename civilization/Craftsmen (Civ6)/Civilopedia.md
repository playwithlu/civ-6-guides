# Craftsmen (Civ6)/Civilopedia

The craft guilds of the Middle Ages not only protected craftsmen (and their customers from shoddy work), but insured that there would be ever more craftsmen. An aspiring craftsman would pass through various levels of training and responsibility – from apprentice to journeyman – before being tasked with producing a “masterpiece.” If that was acceptable, the candidate would be a master craftsman, capable of producing the finest of works in their craft, be that jewelry or carpentry. As new crafts evolved across medieval Europe, new craftsmen swelled the growing cities: cobblers, barbers, brewers, curriers, farriers, apothecaries … a nigh endless list of the middle class.
