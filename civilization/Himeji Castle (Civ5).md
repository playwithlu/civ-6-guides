# Himeji Castle (Civ5)

Strategy.
Another purely defensive wonder, Himeji Castle makes [Unit%20%28Civ5%29](units) defending your lands stronger, as opposed to slowing down the enemy like the [Great%20Wall%20%28Civ5%29](Great Wall). An interesting strategy for a player seeking a [Domination%20victory%20%28Civ5%29](domination victory) is to build the Wonder to prevent enemies from gaining a universal 15% strength in their [Territory%20%28Civ5%29](territory). This may only be achievable on lower [Difficulty%20level%20%28Civ5%29](difficulties), as most warmongers will have started their wars by now, and would benefit more from making units than making this wonder.
Himeji Castle can also be useful offensively because the combat bonus also applies to conquered enemy [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities), which can serve as forward bases and give you a strong safe zone to retreat to when your army is wounded.
Note that, as with other similar [Promotions%20%28Civ5%29](promotions), units sitting in friendly territory attacking enemies outside of your territory will not get the bonus for attacking. This is because the battleground is considered to be the tile where the "defending" unit is, not the attacker, so you'll only get an attack bonus against enemy units who are actually inside your territory; similarly, your units only gain the defensive bonus when they are actually inside your territory. For example, you will not gain the bonus if an enemy inside your territory fires upon your unit outside of your territory, because the battleground location is the defending unit's position and Himeji Castle only affects battles taking place inside your territory.
Finally, if you plan on building Himeji Castle in a city, don't build a [Castle%20%28Civ5%29](Castle) there.
