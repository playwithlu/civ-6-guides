# Coenus (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Coenus was a reliable general who preferred to lead by example. His temperamental similarity with Alexander is likely why he was handed command of the right-most phalanx, a crucial part of the Macedonian hammer-and-anvil. Coenus had earned such respect that he ultimately swayed Alexander to return from his Indian conquests.
