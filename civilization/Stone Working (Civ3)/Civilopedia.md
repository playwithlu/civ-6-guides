# Stone Working (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Stone was one of the earliest materials used by prehistoric man. As time progressed basic stones were turned
into tools by deliberately shaping them for specific purposes. Flint was one of the most popular stones for use
as a tool, but fine sandstone and some volcanic rocks were also widely used. The earliest tools were basic shapes
held in the hand but gradually they became more sophisticated and techniques such as attaching a wooden handle to
a stone head to form an axe became common. In the late Neolithic period stone tools were improved by polishing,
and polished stone axes were used to clear forests for cultivation. Modern tests with Neolithic axes have shown
that they were remarkably effective at felling trees.
