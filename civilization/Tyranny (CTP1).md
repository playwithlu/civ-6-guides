Tyrannies existed well before the dawn of civilization. These governments relied on a small force of trained warriors to protect against foreign and domestic opposition, but otherwise gave the citizens little incentive to support their regimes. As a result, when governing over large regions, Tyrannies were susceptible to revolutions and to coups. As Voltaire once said, "The best government is a benevolent tyranny tempered by an occasional assassination."
