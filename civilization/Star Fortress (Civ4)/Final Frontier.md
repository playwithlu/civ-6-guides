Civilopedia entry.
Astro-synchronous combat is often an extremely complicated affair, with defending ships having to fight both the barrages of their enemies and the orbital pull of their home planets. Star Fortresses, a long series of docking bays, sensors and armaments in orbit around a Star System, provide a continual buttress against enemy onslaughts.
