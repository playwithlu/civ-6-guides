# Alfonso XI (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Known as Alfonso the Just, he was king of Castile and Leon, inheriting the throne from his father, Ferdinand IV when he was just a year old. Upon coming to age in 1325, he successfully squashed the squabbling (and the power) of the noble families, instituted important legal reforms in the Ordinances of Alcala de Hernares, and waged war against the Marinid Berbers, winning an important victory over them at the Battle of Salado River in Andalusia.
Alfonso died of the Black Death during a siege of Gibraltar in 1350, and reign passed to his son, Peter the Cruel.
