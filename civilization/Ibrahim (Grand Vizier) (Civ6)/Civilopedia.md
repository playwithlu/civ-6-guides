# Ibrahim (Grand Vizier) (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Pargali Ibrahim Pasha was Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire and childhood friend of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. Likely born in Epirus around 1495, to a Christian family, he was a household slave of the same age as the young Suleiman, and the two were close growing up. First appointed as the Royal Falconer to Suleiman, he gained greater and greater status over his thirteen years in office, eventually becoming Grand Vizier and commander of the armies in 1523. By many accounts, he was loyal to Suleiman and trusted by the sultanâ€”at least at first.
Suleiman trusted Ibrahim Pasha enough to appoint him governor of Egypt in 1525 to reform that province (the previous governor had opted to revolt; some changes were obviously in order), but after that Ibrahim appears to have fallen under suspicion in the Topkapi palace intrigue. As a powerful minister, he wielded almost as much authority as the sultan himself, who began to suspect his old friend of conspiracy. Eventually in 1536, Suleiman ordered his execution and confiscation of his property.
At least two palaces used by Ibrahim Pasha survive today in Istanbul and Cairo.
