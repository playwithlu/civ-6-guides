Summary.
The discovery of Wormholes is the first step toward achieving victory via completion of the Alien Life Project. Wormholes allow the construction of the Wormhole Sensor Wonder and, by extension, the Wormhole Probeâ€”a robotic spacecraft designed to pass through the wormhole and return with a sample of alien DNA.
Great Library entry.
Since Einstein, scientists speculated that time and space could be folded together and pierced to allow for travel to infinitely distant parts of the galaxy. In the 21st Century, new advances in atomic manipulation detected a wormhole's presence in Earth's orbit. While the world's governments denied the possibility of wormhole travel in public, powerful factions competed viciously in secret to construct the first craft capable of such a daring flight.
