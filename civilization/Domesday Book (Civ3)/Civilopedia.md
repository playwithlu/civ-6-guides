# Domesday Book (Civ3)/Civilopedia

The Domesday Book was the voluminous record kept by William the Conqueror of all his subjects' lands, possessions, 
and incomes. He expended a huge amount of effort to keep it up to date and accurate. With it, he always knew the 
state of his kingdom and the political stability of the lords who supported and opposed him. The name is derived from 
"doomsday", since, like the Biblical doomsday, there was no appealing or disagreeing with the records contained in the Book. 
The Book still exists today, and is kept in London.
