# Barbarian (Civ4)

Barbarians are a special "[List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ4](civilization)" that is always at war with all normal civilizations. Barbarian [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ4](units) can be spawned out of nothing via a random process. Players often refer to barbarians as just barbs.
Generation.
Barbarians can be built normally in barbarian [City%20%28Civ4%29](cities). When the city has enough defenders (the number varies with [Difficulty%20level%20%28Civ4%29](difficulty level)), extra units will leave the city and wander the continent.
Barbarians can be spawned from [Tribal%20Village%20%28Civ4%29](Tribal Villages) if the civilization entering the village has bad luck. Note that using a [Scout%20%28Civ4%29](Scout) (or [Explorer%20%28Civ4%29](Explorer)) prevents this outcome: huts cannot spawn barbarians if explored by a Scout.
Barbarians can also be generated out of nothing, in any land or coast tile which is
The chance for barbarian generation is higher for tundra and desert tiles. In the very early game, the barbarians spawned will be [Animal%20%28Civ4%29](animals). After a particular turn, animals can no longer spawn, and only normal units ([Warrior%20%28Civ4%29](Warriors) and [Archer%20%28Civ4%29](Archers) initially) will spawn.
One other way in which barbs can be created is via events. There is a rare event called "barbarian uprising" which can happen very early in the game, producing a stack of barbarians that will invade and attempt to take a city.
Barbarians can never be permanently wiped from the planet. Even if you destroy every barbarian unit and city currently visible, they will always respawn eventually.
Barbarian units.
A number of special rules apply to barbarian units. Both human and [AI](AI) players are given bonuses in [Combat%20%28Civ4%29](combat) against them, even including "free wins" for humans at low difficulty levels. However, the amount of [experience](experience) a unit may get from fighting barbarians is capped. A unit cannot raise its experience above 5 experience via fighting animals or above 10 fighting other barbarians.
Here is a table relating the difficulty level to various aspects of barbarian units:
Barbarian Civilization.
The barbarian civilization is a civilization that is always at war with other civilizations, and cannot communicate with them. It is led by a [Leaders%20%28Civ4%29](leader) with no [Leader%20trait%20%28Civ4%29](traits) (modeled after [Sid%20Meier](Sid Meier), though cannot be talked to in-game). Other than that, it behaves like AIs do. Barbarians do research new tech (although very slowly).
Barbarian Cities.
Some time after the point in the game where animals stop spawning, barbarian cities can randomly appear. Barb cities follow the same limits on spawning as units do.
Barbarian cities follow the same rules as other cities. Eventually they will build [Worker%20%28Civ4%29](Workers) and [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ4%29](improve) their land. A city will build [List%20of%20buildings%20in%20Civ4](buildings) if the barbarians have the tech to do so; this may include culture buildings which will eventually expand the barbarian cultural borders just as civs do.
The city names come from tribes and cultures not included in the [Civilization%20%28series%29]("Civilization" series).
