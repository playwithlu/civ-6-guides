# Artillery (Civ5)

Game Info.
Siege unit of the [Industrial%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Industrial Era). Upgrades from the [Cannon%20%28Civ5%29](Cannon).
Strategy.
Artillery is a deadly siege weapon, much more powerful and dangerous than the earlier Cannon for one main reason: its new way of firing. Unlike the Cannon, which still shoots in a linear fashion, the Artillery uses high-yield dynamite-based substances to propel its shells high into the air, using [Earth](Earth)'s gravity as means of reaching both farther away and over any potential obstacles. This ability, called "Indirect Fire", allows it to shoot over obstructions at targets it cannot see if an allied [Unit%20%28Civ5%29](unit) provides intel, remedying its limited visibility.
Other problems of the older siege weapons persist - the Artillery has limited visibility and must set up (1 MP) to attack. It is also vulnerable to melee attacks.
The Artillery is one of the units that completely changes combat tactics in modern times. Its main feature is its range of 3. That means that the Artillery can shoot at [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities) from outside their defensive perimeter, allowing the attacker to reduce city defenses to rubble without suffering any damage whatsoever. That, in turn, forces everyone to reevaluate the way they defend their empires.
This unit is also great for defending cities for the same reason, being able to shoot back at attacking enemies without leaving itself vulnerable to attack.
