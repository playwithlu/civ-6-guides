# St. Peter's Basilica (Civ3)/Civilopedia

The Emperor Constantine was the first great builder of Christian churches at Rome, Constantinople and other key cities 
throughout the empire. His greatest work in Rome was the establishment of St. Peter's Basilica on the slopes of Vatican hill.
This original St. Peter's was built over the site of the Nero Circus, where the apostle Peter was martyred and buried.
Little of the original basilica remains, having been superceded by the great Renaissance version of St. Peter's 
built during the 16th Century. However, this Vatican city site remains the worldwide center of the Catholic Church.
