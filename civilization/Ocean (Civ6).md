# Ocean (Civ6)

Ocean is a base [Terrain%20%28Civ6%29](terrain) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It comprises all water expanses which are outside the shelf area, farther from land.
Strategy.
Ocean tiles, unlike [Coast%20%28Civ6%29](Coast) tiles, provide nothing for a [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) except {{Shipwreck6}}s. Fortunately (since you cannot found a city in the water, like in ""), you usually won't need to worry about that, because you will have few or no Ocean tiles close enough for a city to work.
For all [Naval%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](naval) and embarked units, oceans are impassible until the {{Link6|Cartography}} technology is researched (or for [Norwegian%20%28Civ6%29](Norway), the {{Link6|Shipbuilding}} tech, and for the [M%C4%81ori%20%28Civ6%29](MƒÅori), no tech). Thus, they present an insurmountable obstacle to early game exploration, and it is usual for different continents to remain separate (without contact with each other) until someone researches the necessary tech to sail in ocean. However, there is one other way to brave the open ocean: recruiting the [Medieval%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Medieval Era) [Great%20Admiral%20%28Civ6%29](Great Admiral), [Leif%20Erikson%20%28Civ6%29](Leif Erikson), and retiring him allows you to cross Oceans.
With "", [Seastead%20%28Civ6%29](Seasteads) can be constructed to improve these tiles.
