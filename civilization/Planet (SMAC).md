# Planet (SMAC)

Planet is what the living organism that dominates the planet is called. In earlier scripts it was called [Chiron](Chiron).
Its fungus acts as a giant brain. It can control all forms of [native%20life%20%28SMAC%29](native life), using them to attack any who upset it.
It begins to speak to the colonist after a certain time period, and gains understanding of them over time. Its voice is provided by [Alena%20Kanka](Alena Kanka).
