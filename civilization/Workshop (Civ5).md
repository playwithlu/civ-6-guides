# Workshop (Civ5)

Game Info.
[Medieval%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Medieval Era) [Production%20%28Civ5%29](production)-boosting building.
Strategy.
The Workshop is the first standard {{Production5}}-boosting building that doesn't require [Resources%20%28Civ5%29](resources) (like the [Stone%20Works%20%28Civ5%29](Stone Works) or [Stable%20%28Civ5%29](Stable)) and can be built in every [City%20%28Civ5%29](city). It also allows the assignment of your first {{Engineer5}} for another 2 {{Production5}} (for a total of 4), increasing the speed at which [Great%20Engineer%20%28Civ5%29](Great Engineers) appear.
In "", a Workshop is needed to trade {{Production5}} (via a [Trade%20route%20%28Civ5%29](trade route)) to another city in your empire. You also need one in every city in order to build the [Ironworks%20%28Civ5%29](Ironworks), a useful {{Link5|National Wonder}}.
