# Advanced Flight (Civ6)

Advanced Flight is an [Atomic%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Atomic Era) [Technologies%20%28Civ6%29](technology) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It can be hurried by building 3 [Biplane%20%28Civ6%29](Biplanes) (2 Biplanes in ""). 
Strategy.
After it becomes clear that man can indeed conquer the skies, and that he can do so much there, it is only a matter of time until the technology involved is developed further. New, lighter construction materials are needed for planes to be able to carry more weight without sacrificing mobility, and thus the recently revealed {{Aluminum6}} enters use. This makes possible a new generation of airplanes — the [Fighter%20%28Civ6%29](Fighter) and the [Bomber%20%28Civ6%29](Bomber) — as well as a more advanced support building in the [Aerodrome%20%28Civ6%29](Aerodrome): the [Airport%20%28Civ6%29](Airport). Soon civilian air travel will develop and forever change our understanding of what distance is.
