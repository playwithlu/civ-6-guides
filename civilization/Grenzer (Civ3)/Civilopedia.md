# Grenzer (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Grenzers were Austrian light infantry originally mustered in Croatia. Grenzers were promised a land entitlement
in return for protecting border ("Grenze") areas against the Turks. Battalions of "Grenzinfanterie" were used as
skirmishers, but they often fought in closed order.
