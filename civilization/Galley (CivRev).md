# Galley (CivRev)

Galleys are both useful and easily accessible in "[Civilization%20Revolution](Civilization Revolution)". They are available to every [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20CivRev](civilization) from the very beginning of the game and can be used as soon as one is constructed, or even gotten from a defeated [Barbarian%20%28CivRev%29](Barbarian) village.
Unit Analysis.
Galleys can attack and defend like other units, but are rather weak and slow (especially when compared to [Cruiser%20%28CivRev%29](Cruisers) and [Battleship%20%28CivRev%29](Battleships)). However, as the first seagoing vessels, they have several uses:
Galleys can only sail in shallow waters (pale colored sea), restricting the ship's movement to coastal areas. (There is an exception in some [List%20of%20scenarios%20in%20CivRev](scenarios); one downloadable add-on has a [Wonder%20%28CivRev%29](Wonder) that allows the builder's Galleys to go anywhere.) However, these ships can hold as many units as other ships to explore new lands and to take a fast route to enemies' cities and victory! Galleys may move up to 2 spaces per turn, and the [Ranger%20Militia%20%28CivRev%29](Ranger Militia) that they come with may move 1 space per turn on land.
Building the [Leonardo%27s%20Workshop%20%28CivRev%29](Leonardo's Workshop) Wonder will upgrade galleys to [Galleon%20%28CivRev%29](Galleons) or Cruisers (depending on the civilization's technology at the time), but not to Battleships.
Unique Replacements.
[Greek%20%28CivRev%29](Greek) Galleys are replaced by the Trireme. It is the same as the regular Galley.
