Gameplay.
Shaka's aggression is untempered in the event that his nation is less capable than your own. Even with his back against the wall, Shaka seems to prefer war to peace. Tactically, the Zulus don't usually develop their land overly, and are only moderately expansionist, making them not as great a threat as listed officially.
