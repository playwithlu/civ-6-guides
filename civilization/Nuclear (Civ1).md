# Nuclear (Civ1)

Nuclear weapons must be placed in a city or on a [Carrier%20%28Civ1%29](Carrier) at the end of every turn (unless they are used to attack). Nuclear weapons may ignore [Zone%20of%20Control](zones of control) and are invisible to enemy players. The [Manhattan%20Project%20%28Civ1%29](Manhattan Project) must be constructed to allow the construction of Nuclear weapons. When used on land, Nuclear weapons destroy every unit in the target square and each adjacent square, and will halve the population of a city if used on one; however, they cause [Pollution%20%28Civ1%29](pollution) in each of these squares. They can be used against enemy naval units without the consequences of pollution.
The only defense against Nuclear weapons is the [SDI%20Defense%20%28Civ1%29](SDI Defense).
Civilopedia entry.
The atomic bomb changed all the standards for measuring military power. The strongest cities and the most powerful ground forces could be erased from the map with the release of just one Nuclear bomb. Nuclear weapons could obliterate any target. The only viable defense against the Nuclear threat was to acquire one's own arsenal of Nuclear weapons as a deterrent. It is ironic to many that the development of the most devastating weapon of history was at least partly responsible for the longest period of relative world peace.
