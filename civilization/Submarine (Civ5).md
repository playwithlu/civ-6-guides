# Submarine (Civ5)

Game Info.
Specialized ranged naval unit of the [Modern%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Modern Era).
Strategy.
The Submarine is a unique new invention of the Modern Era, a ship capable of traveling and attacking under the water with its torpedoes! As such, it remains invisible to most units - until it attacks. And then, it receives an enormous attack bonus, which allows its torpedoes in many instances to sink a full-health ship with a single shot! These qualities make it exceptionally dangerous for the enemy fleet, and radically change the game on the naval front. At the same time, the torpedoes can't harm land-based units and defenses, making the Submarine a specialized ship-killing unit. An experienced player may sneak Submarines to your shores, sink undefended lone ships, then retreat and disappear before you can react! The only way to defend against this is to keep your ships grouped and patrol the waters nearby constantly with Submarine-detecting vessels.
Submarines can quickly "pillage" [Fishing%20Boats%20%28Civ5%29](Fishing Boats). Watch out for ranged attacks by [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities), as cities and garrisons can see Submarines.
The [Destroyer%20%28Civ5%29](Destroyer) is the most effective unit at hunting Submarines because of its great speed and bonus when fighting them; however, it is also slightly more expensive and doesn't have a ranged attack. Engage packs of Destroyers with packs of Submarines.
The Submarine can also enter [Ice%20%28Civ5%29](ice) tiles. Use this ability to hide from enemy Destroyers (which are melee units and can't attack you under the ice).
Training is important, as Submarines only acquire [XP](XP) slowly like other ranged units.
When selecting [Promotions%20%28Civ5%29](promotions) for your Submarines, concentrate on the anti-naval combat power abilities, and on extra sight and . This way you will maximize their striking power, and their ability to get away alive from pursuit.
