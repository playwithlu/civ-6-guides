# Carrier (Civ5)

Game Info.
Specialized ship of the [Modern%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Modern Era).
Strategy.
The Carrier is a specialized vessel which offers a base of operations for fighter airplanes and bombers (but not [Stealth%20Bomber%20%28Civ5%29](Stealth Bombers)). Its development allows a [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilization) to bring its air power to the sea, and deliver it to any point of the [Map%20%28Civ5%29](map) where needed. The Carrier itself is unable to attack, but the aircraft it carries make it the most powerful offensive tactical weapon afloat. Such is its importance that most modern commanders form their fleets around Carriers. Defensively, however, the Carrier is weak and should be escorted by [Destroyer%20%28Civ5%29](Destroyers) and [Submarine%20%28Civ5%29](Submarines).
In "" there are special [Promotions%20%28Civ5%29](promotions) available for the Carrier which allow it to carry more aircraft and defend better against attacks.
Use Carriers to transport your air power over the ocean and to coasts which you can't otherwise reach. Then support your land offensive with your airplanes!
