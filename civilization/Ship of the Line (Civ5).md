Strategy.
The Ship of the Line single-handedly affords the English to control the seas in the [Renaissance%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Renaissance) and even the [Industrial%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Industrial Era). Its combat strength (both melee and ranged) is significantly greater than that of a Frigate, and its rows upon rows of cannons are terrifying against land units of the time. It also has extra sight, to spot its prey from afar.
To match that, its model is slightly bigger than the Frigate model, visually declaring its magnificence.
