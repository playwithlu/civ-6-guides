Strategy.
The Venetian Arsenal is invaluable for [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) that seek naval supremacy. Basically, it grants you the [Scythian%20%28Civ6%29](Scythian) civilization ability, but for [Naval%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](naval units). This bonus applies to all the owner's [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities), but it works only for units that are built, not those purchased with either or . The wonder also provides points, which will speed up the acquisition of Great Engineers who can develop your cities and supplement their potential.
[Phoenician%20%28Civ6%29](Phoenicia) should definitely consider building the Venetian Arsenal, since their [Cothon%20%28Civ6%29](Cothon) already grants 50% bonus to all naval units. This wonder is also a viable choice for [Brazilian%20%28Civ6%29](Brazil) to make the most of their fearsome [Minas%20Geraes%20%28Civ6%29](Minas Geraes). [English%20%28Civ6%29](England) with her [Sea%20Dog%20%28Civ6%29](Sea Dogs) is yet another civilization that can benefit greatly from securing this wonder, since the Sea Dogs will be able to further bolster England's already impressive navy by capturing enemy ships. To a lesser extent, [Portuguese%20%28Civ6%29](Portugal) can sometimes find the Venetian Arsenal useful, provided that the [Map%20%28Civ6%29](map) has many long coastlines along which their [Nau%20%28Civ6%29](Naus) can build [Feitoria%20%28Civ6%29](Feitorias). Finally, while this wonder comes a bit late for [Norwegian%20%28Civ6%29](Norway) to build [Viking%20Longship%20%28Civ6%29](Viking Longships) en masse, it will still be useful for building [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Naval%20melee](naval melee units) to continue their raids.
Note that if you train a Fleet or an Armada in one of your cities, the duplicate will also be a Fleet or an Armada, making this wonder extra effective.
