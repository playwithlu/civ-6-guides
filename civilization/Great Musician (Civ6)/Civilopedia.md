# Great Musician (Civ6)/Civilopedia

It has been said that “music is the soul of a people.” If that is indeed the case, then “great musicians” are the guardians of that soul. Whatever the form, whatever the beat, whatever the instruments, no other art speaks to our emotions like music. Since it does, it is also the most subjective of the arts; what is heavenly harmony to one is just a cacophony of noise to another. That rather broadens the definition of what is “great” music; perhaps the best way to judge this “greatness” is how long a piece has continued to be played and appreciated by others. But from the time that men first beat out a rhythm on logs to the modern electronic orchestra, great composers and performers have expressed the collective sorrows and joys of each civilization.
