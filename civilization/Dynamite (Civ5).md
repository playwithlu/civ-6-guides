# Dynamite (Civ5)

Game Info.
The invention of Dynamite literally propels siege weaponry into the modern age. This high-explosive upgrade of gunpowder allows big guns with unprecedented range and power, making possible modern cannons, starting with the [Artillery%20%28Civ5%29](Artillery).
If you have the [Great%20Wall%20%28Civ5%29](Great Wall) [List%20of%20wonders%20in%20Civ5](wonder), it will cease to function upon researching Dynamite. This only applies to your own Great Wall when you research it; another player with Dynamite will still be affected by your Great Wall even if they have Dynamite, so long as you don't have it.
