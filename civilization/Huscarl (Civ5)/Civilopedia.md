# Huscarl (Civ5)/Civilopedia

The Anglo-Saxon Huscarls, the medieval equivalent of the modern bodyguard, were professionally trained and well-compensated soldiers who served the king and other nobility. Equipped with waist-length chainmail coats known as "Byrnies," and typically armed with battle-axes, the Huscarls were an intimidating defensive force throughout the 11th and 12th centuries.
