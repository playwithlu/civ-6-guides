# Cruiser (Civ2)

The Cruiser is a sea unit in "[Civilization%20II](Civilization II)".
Civilopedia entry.
The cruiser is the modern equivalent of the frigate. Although much more powerful than its sailing forebearer, it is designed for the same type of mission: to act as a sea raider and escort. Cruisers can conduct shore bombardments, though their firepower cannot match the destructive force of the battleship. The cruiser's defensive capabilities are also inferior to those of the battleship. These shortcomings are balanced by the cruiser's lower cost and higher speed. Cruisers serve an important role in scouting missions, convoy escorts, and the attack of transport vessels.
