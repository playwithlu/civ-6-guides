Napoleon speaks modern . On his diplomacy screen, he is sitting on his horse on a foggy battlefield. Concept art portrayed soldiers marching behind him. The ambient music for Napoleon also contains what sounds like construction or men setting up something.

Personality and Behavior.
Napoleon tends to go for a [Cultural%20victory%20%28Civ5%29](cultural victory).
Given Napoleon's military prowess, the French will have a good offensive army. On the other hand, they do not fare well in defensive combats.
Napoleon will try to expand his empire as fast as he can in the early stages. His main emphasis, however, is obviously .
Napoleon is not particularly hostile, but it is very difficult to make friends with him, as he tends to declare war on every [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilization) or [City-state%20%28Civ5%29](city-state) he meets. He is one of the [Leaders%20%28Civ5%29](leaders) least likely to be afraid, as well as one of the boldest and most competitive ones. Quite surprisingly, he is very willing to forgive and almost never denounces anyone.
Players who are neighbors of France should be on high alert for Napoleon, as he will declare war if he finds them weak. However, they can actually get along well with Napoleon if he sees them as warmongers. Just beware of his deceptiveness, because like many militaristic leaders, he's willing to backstab his allies if he considers them unworthy.
Lines.
In these comments, Napoleon exclusively uses the informal "tu" form for the second person pronoun. After the French Revolution, the informal form was indeed preferred to the more formal "vous" form (which a real, modern French head of state would most likely use when speaking with another world leader) in order to emphasize the "equality of citizens."
Intro.
Long life and triumph to you, First Consul and Emperor of France, Napoleon I, ruler of the French people. France lies at the heart of Europe. Long has Paris been the world center of culture, arts and letters. Although surrounded by competitors - and often enemies - France has endured as a great nation.
