# Palace of the Masks (Civ3)/Civilopedia

The Palace of the Masks is one of the splendors of Mesoamerica. Located in the Mayan city of Kabah, it's adorned with over 250 rain-god masks inlaid across six separate tiers. Each mask comprises 30 pieces of mosaic stone, all brilliantly sculpted by Mayan craftsman. At its rear rests several large warrior sculptures. Archeologists believe that the palace once served as terminus for a roadway connected Kabah to Uxmal.
