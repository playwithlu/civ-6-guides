# Oil (Civ5)

Game Info.
Late-game strategic resource. Used by most of the powerful late industrial-early modern era [Unit%20%28Civ5%29](units).
Strategy.
Unimproved, the {{OilIcon5}} Oil resource itself doesn't provide a big {{Production5}} bonus (only +1), but both of the improvements add a whopping +3 {{Production5}}. This is a total of +4 {{Production5}} over the base tile yield, which makes the tile really productive. Sea-based sources of {{OilIcon5}} Oil are even more useful because of the additional bonuses the [Lighthouse%20%28Civ5%29](Lighthouse) and the [Seaport%20%28Civ5%29](Seaport) provide (+2 {{Production5}} and +1 {{Gold5}}, apart from the Offshore Platform's own bonus).
