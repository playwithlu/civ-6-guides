# Library (Civ5)

Game Info.
Basic science building of the [Ancient%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Ancient Era).
Strategy.
The Library increases the output of the [City%20%28Civ5%29](city), speeding up a [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilization's) acquisition of new [List%20of%20technologies%20in%20Civ5](technology). It is the first science building, so it's a must (all other buildings from the science chain require it), and its effect becomes greater as the city's increases.
You need a Library in every city in order to unlock the [National%20College%20%28Civ5%29](National College).
Note that the [Great%20Library%20%28Civ5%29](Great Library) provides a free Library. If you plan on constructing this [List%20of%20wonders%20in%20Civ5](wonder) in one of your cities, don't bother building a Library there!
