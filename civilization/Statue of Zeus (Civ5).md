# Statue of Zeus (Civ5)

Game Info.
Requires [Honor%20%28Civ5%29](Honor). ()
Strategy.
The Statue of Zeus is a decent wonder for all players pursuing a [Domination%20victory%20%28Civ5%29](domination victory). Its bonus helps you do what you need to do most: conquer enemy [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities) faster. Although its benefits are minimal early on in the game, they become more significant when you gain access to siege weapons and the more advanced and powerful units of the later [Era%20%28Civ5%29](eras).
On higher [Difficulty%20level%20%28Civ5%29](difficulties), it may be more advisable to capture this wonder rather than build it, as it offers little in terms of infrastructure at a time where infrastructure is highly prioritized. Furthermore, the Honor policy tree is weak for infrastructure and [Liberty%20%28Civ5%29](Liberty) is often much better.
