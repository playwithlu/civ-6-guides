Strategy.
In antiquity war was often regarded as an honorable deed - you stand face-to-face with your enemy and get to defeat him by the strength of your arms (or die in the attempt, of course).
But the Industrial Era introduces modern weapons, with their explosions and destruction on a much larger scale than any previously possible. And suddenly the respect for the enemy disappears. Just as the philosophical movement of humanism preaches respect to life, this life gets destroyed ever more easily through modern weapons. And this incredible contradiction finds its peak in the "scorched earth" strategy - when an army invades a land and destroys its towns, villages and farms, instead of its soldiers. The result is terrible, but effective - the invaded populace simply loses the will to fight and to support the war, which is much preferable to fighting determined soldiers on a level battlefield.
