# International Project (Civ5)

An International Project is a new concept introduced in "", where civilizations in a game are given the chance to all contribute to the same global project effort for benefits. There are three International Projects available in the game: the [World%27s%20Fair%20%28Civ5%29](World's Fair), the [International%20Games%20%28Civ5%29](International Games), and the [International%20Space%20Station%20%28Civ5%29](International Space Station).
Details and Rewards.
To start an International Project, one is required to pass the respective [Resolutions%20%28Civ5%29](resolution) through the [World%20Congress%20%28Civ5%29](World Congress). Once the resolution is passed, civs can begin working on it by selecting said project in the production menu in any of their cities. The ability to build it will last until the project is completed. A bonus with passing these resolutions is that it will give you a small diplomatic bonus with other civilizations, as unlike other resolutions these international projects do not anger the leaders.
There are three types of prizes that you can get from your contribution to each of these projects, based on the number of {{Production5}} you contributed to the project. The first two, {{TrophyBronzeIcon5}} Bronze and {{TrophySilverIcon5}} Silver, simply require you to contribute a set amount of {{Production5}}, while the last one, {{TrophyGoldIcon5}} Gold, requires you to have contributed the most to the project.
The progress of the project is updated each turn, although this doesn't show on the main screen. Instead, global notes are issued after the project passes some thresholds (for example 40%). You can. however, check the exact progress at all times by simply pointing at the project icon in any of your cities that works on it. The pop-up info tab will show you not only the exact amount of {{Production5}} you have contributed currently, but also the exact completion percentage. You can use this through several turns to extrapolate approximately how much other civilizations are contributing, and do you have a chance to compete for the Gold Medal.

Strategy.
Ideally, you would like to get the highest contributor for all of the International Projects to enjoy all their respective benefits. Even if you are not trying to go for the victory type related to the particular project, you should still consider trying to go for the Gold prize anyway (so that other civs don't get its bonus). Ideally, you would also like to spend as little wasted production as possible so that you may build other things as well. Therefore, you should always try to get at least 50% of the total production that is required to finish the project, at which point other civs will be unable to surpass your contribution.
The number of {{Production5}} points required to finish an International Project is calculated as follows:
 10 * project_value * start_num_civs * game_speed_mod
Use the formula above to work out the total number of {{Production5}} points to finish the project, then divide it by 2 to get the number you should contribute to. Note that this is exactly 50% of the total contribution and you need to contribute "at least" 50%, so add in one more {{Production5}}.
For convenience, the table below gives you the {{Production5}} values for the completion of each project, as well as the minimum amount of {{Production5}} you need to contribute:
Note that this table only shows how much {{Production5}} you need to guarantee being the highest contributor, valid for the Standard game speed. The project only finishes when the total {{Production5}} has been put in, so if by some bizarre chance no one else contributes, the project will never finish and you still won't get the bonus.
