# Hunting (Civ4)/Civilopedia

In its most general sense, hunting is the pursuit of a target. For ancient societies, before the widespread domestication of animals and the creation of "livestock", hunting was vital to survival in the hunter-gatherer way of life. Hunting provided an important source of protein to augment the foraged plants and vegetables that made up the majority of the hunter-gatherer's diet. Hunting also provided significant exercise and challenges to these advancing people that improved communication and teamwork skills. Not only did hunting provide diet potential, but it also served as a way for early man to protect itself from cold weather through the use of furs and animal hides from the fallen beasts. The amount of energy that early humans put into hunting forced them to constantly discover new and creative ways to use every part of the animal.
