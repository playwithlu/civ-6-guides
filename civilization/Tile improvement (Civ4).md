# Tile improvement (Civ4)

A tile improvement is a modification to a base [tile](tile) which typically increases its [production%20%28Civ4%29](production) and may also unlock a [Resource%20%28Civ4%29](resource) if the tile has one. Land tile improvements are made by [Worker%20%28Civ4%29](Workers); [Work%20boat%20%28Civ4%29](Work Boats) are required to improve water tiles. Generally players call tile improvements just improvements, since other kinds of improvement have distinct and more particular labels. However, you may sometimes see [Building%20%28Civ4%29](buildings) referred to as "city improvements."
