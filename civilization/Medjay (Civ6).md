The Medjay is a [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Melee](melee unit) from the [Gifts%20of%20the%20Nile%20%28Civ6%29](Gifts of the Nile) [List%20of%20scenarios%20in%20Civ6](scenario) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It can only be trained in a [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) that has a [Holy%20Site%20%28Civ6%29](Holy Site) with a [Shrine%20%28Civ6%29](Shrine).
Strategy.
The Medjay is a strong, maintenance-free unit that becomes even stronger when adjacent to a Holy Site in friendly territory. They're best used to defend your land from foreign invaders, but stationing them near a Holy Site in a newly-captured city may deter the enemy from trying to retake it.
