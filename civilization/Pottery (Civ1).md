Concomitant and essential to the Agricultural Revolution was the invention of Pottery. For seasonal crops and domesticated animals to be really useful, sturdy and waterproof containers were necessary to hold and protect the surplus until needed. The discovery of the properties of clay, the kiln, and the potter's wheel made dependable containers possible. Pottery was essential to the growth of substantial human populations. Without it, cities would not have been possible.
