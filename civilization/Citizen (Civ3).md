# Citizen (Civ3)

Citizens are the basic units of population in "[Civilization%20III](Civilization III)". Citizens perform functions such as working [City%20%28Civ3%29](city) squares, or may take on non-productive specialized roles. Each citizen eats two [Food%20%28Civ3%29](food) per turn.
Laborers.
Laborers are the most basic and numerous citizen they work a single tile around their city and their output is dependent on what happens to be on the tile. An irrigated flood plain will make them very productive in food production, capable of supporting themselves and other citizens on less productive tiles (such as mined mountains with gold and mined hills). The city square is always worked for free.
Specialists.
Specialists are laborers who do not work on tiles around the city and instead work specialised roles, their major benefit is their production is often uncorruptible but also not affected by city improvements. A Scientist will produce only 3 (or 1 beaker) regardless of how many libraries or universities the city has.
Foreign nationals.
Foreign nationals are otherwise exactly the same as native nationals and work exactly the same as they do. Foreign nationals are created when you 'add' a captured foreign worker unit to one of your cities. Their major difference from native citizens is that they cause extra unhappiness when at war with their home country, and their presence makes the city more vulnerable to culture flipping to their home nation. However, if resettled in your capital or far away from their homeland and not at war they are otherwise exactly the same. Over time they will assimilate depending on your government type.
Resisters.
Resisters are created when you capture an enemy city and they must be put down by military units stationed in the city in order to turn them into productive citizen laborers.
