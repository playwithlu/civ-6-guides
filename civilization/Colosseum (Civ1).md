Civilopedia entry.
The original Colosseum of Rome presented spectacles intended to entertain and divert the landless, jobless citizenry who were supported by massive handouts.

revived, again to provide entertainment and diversion. The promotions today are music concerts and professional sports contests. However, the modern spectacles
have not exhibited the barbarity of ancient times, with the notable exception of ice hockey games.
