Before Machine Tools, craftsmen hand-tooled all parts, with each part varying considerably. For high performance mechanical clocks, such variation was intolerable.

Not only did this result in lower repair costs and cheaper products, but with the new machine tools, the worker lost his idiosyncratic ways. The factory loomed near.
