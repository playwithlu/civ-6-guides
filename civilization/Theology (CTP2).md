Theology was the study of God, man, the world, salvation and eschatology (or the study of "end" times). It was a discipline almost exclusively limited to Christianity. It's origins lie with the Greek philosopher Plato (c.428-c.348 BC), who was the first to put for theology as a field of study. Although Plato's concept of theology dealt with Greek, not Christian, myths, the fundamental nature of the study came from him, namely: theology is the attempt of believers of a faith to represent their statements of belief consistently, to logically analyze them out of the fundamentals of their faith and to properly contextualize such statements within nature, history, reason and logic.
A scientific analysis of something as emotionally and ontologically complex as religious faith seemed incongruous to some people. Nevertheless, theology has served to explicate and reinforce the central tenets of many faiths, and provided the basis for the Theocracy, a government based on religious law.
