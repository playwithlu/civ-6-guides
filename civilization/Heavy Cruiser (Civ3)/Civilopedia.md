# Heavy Cruiser (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Cruisers have long served in the role of escort and defensive vessels, screening carrier task forces and 
amphibious assaults from enemy ships and aircraft. During WWII cruisers were classified as light ("CL") or
heavy ("CA"). Light cruisers typically had guns no larger than 6" in diameter, whereas heavy cruisers had
guns larger than 6" but smaller than 8". Unlike most cruisers fielded by the Allies, Japanese cruisers also
sported deadly banks of Long Lance oxygen-fueled torpedoes. Furthermore, the Japanese ships carried
reloads for their deadly torpedoes (torpedoes were one-shot deals for other navies). Heavy Cruisers were
involved in most of WWII's famous battles in the Pacific, including the Battle of Java Sea (a spectacular
victory for the Japanese) and the Battle of Midway (a resounding win for the U.S. Navy).
