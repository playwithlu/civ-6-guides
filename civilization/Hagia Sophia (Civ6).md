# Hagia Sophia (Civ6)

[Missionary%20%28Civ6%29](Missionaries) and [Apostle%20%28Civ6%29](Apostles) can spread Religion 1 extra time.
The Hagia Sophia is a {{Link6|Medieval Era}} {{Link6|Wonder}} in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It must be built on flat land adjacent to a {{Link6|Holy Site}}, and you must have founded a {{Link6|Religion}}.
In "", this Wonder is unlocked with [Buttress%20%28Civ6%29](Buttress) instead of [Education%20%28Civ6%29](Education).
Strategy.
The extra {{Faith6}} and bonus spreads for Missionaries and Apostles that the Hagia Sophia provides are quite helpful. Any [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) that wants to win a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Religion](Religious Victory) should make building this wonder a high priority.
This wonder has extra synergy with the [Mosque%20%28Civ6%29](Mosque) Worship belief, as it can give Missionaries and Apostles an unprecedented five Spread Religion charges.
Interestingly, [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Melee](melee units) owned by [Qin%20Shi%20Huang%20%28Civ6%29/Unifier](Qin Shi Huang (Unifier)) also gain 1 extra [Barbarian%20%28Civ6%29](Barbarian) conversion charge, allowing this ability to be twice as effective. However, since Unifier Qin has no incentive to found a religion, you're better off waiting for an opponent to build the Hagia Sophia in one of their [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) and then capturing it.
