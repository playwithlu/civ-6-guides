Gameplay.
A futuristic solution to an ever-mounting {{LinkCTP2|Crime}} problem, the Behavioral Modification Facility does not seek to merely house society's criminals. By rehabilitating criminals through the use of neural reprogramming, it eliminates recidivism and thereby substantially reduces {{LinkCTP2|Crime}}.
Great Library entry.
One of the most troubling aspects of the modern criminal justice system was its inability to properly rehabilitate criminals into productive members of society. Once prosecuted, criminals would enter correctional facilities, serve their time and return to the streets with little "correction" at all. Most of them would become recidivists, or habitual criminals, and spend the better part of the lives in and out of the prison system.
When neural reprogramming systems found wide use in medicine in the late 21st and early 22nd centuries, law enforcement organizations urged correctional facilities to develop a system of rehabilitation that uses brain cell replacement as a means of eliminating recidivism. The Behavioral Modification Facility sought employed neural reprogramming to great effect and dramatically reduced crime and repeat criminal activity.
