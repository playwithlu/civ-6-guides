The city-state of Athens began in the eighth century BC as the wealthier families of Athens banded together to protect their communal interests from tyrannical taxes and rules. The resulting community prided itself on debate and on trade. Politically, the city-state benefited from a fairly equitable society with small differences between rich and poor.
