Strategy.
The Llanero is a strong replacement for the Cavalry, and one that helps the Gran Colombians on their march to a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Domination](Domination Victory). Apart from requiring an easily-obtained [Resource%20%28Civ6%29%23Strategic](strategic resource) (if anything) to train, it's very cheap to maintain and gets fully healed within two [hex](hex)es of a retiring Comandante General. Gran Colombia can have as many as four [Comandante%20General%20%28Civ6%29](Comandantes Generales) upon unlocking Llaneros, which can accompany them into battle and keep them fighting fit for a good long time.
On top of their other attributes, the Combat Strength bonus that Llaneros gain when adjacent to each other practically begs Gran Colombia to train them en masse. Six Llaneros have the same maintenance cost as two [Infantry%20%28Civ6%29](Infantry), and their Combat Strength is almost as high when clustered together (not counting the bonuses they receive from Comandantes Generales and [Great%20General%20%28Civ6%29](Great Generals)). A force of this size can completely surround an enemy [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) and prevent it from repairing damage while [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Ranged](ranged) or [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Siege](siege units) chip away at its defenses, then quickly reach and lay siege to a new city after capturing their target.
