# Dalmace (Civ5)/Civilopedia

Dalmace arose out of necessity. The turmoil of old kingdoms collapsing and new empires emerging left many people of the lower and middle classes marginalized. Some stayed in their homelands but many fled as refugees, not knowing where to go. They gathered in the country estates of nobles that did not have the heart or the force to deny their presence. Soon leaders arose from the ranks of the refugees, calling for organization, protection, food, and resources. Some nobles saw opportunity and joined their ranks, sharing their wealth. Others refused, and their estates were ransacked. These were the first Dalmace compounds, which would grow into cities that rivaled those of any other empire. Dalmace is founded on ideals, and its strength comes from the tight camaraderie and evolving culture of its humble citizens.
