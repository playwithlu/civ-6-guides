# Uluru (Civ6)/Civilopedia

The massive sandstone formation at Australia's geographical center is an inselberg—an "island of rock" emerging from the surrounding flat bushlands. Known as Uluru to the Aboriginal people of the area, it has held cultural and spiritual significance to the Anangu people for countless generations. In 1873 a colonial explorer called it “Ayers Rock” in honor of colonial functionary Henry Ayers, whose greatest accomplishment was having his name applied to a large rock that already had a name. Uluru is known for its natural beauty and shifting colors, especially apparent at dawn and dusk.
