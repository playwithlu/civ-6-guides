# Airship (Civ4)

Strategy.
The Airship is an early flight unit that can perform air strikes, see [Submarine%20%28Civ4%29](Submarines) and inflict significant damage to [Naval%20unit%20%28Civ4%29](Naval Units).
Missions.
With the Recon mission, the Airship enables massively improved, rapid scouting. Air Strike is useful as a support action in an attack, especially with multiple Airships.
