# Amundsen-Scott Research Station (Civ6)

The Amundsen-Scott Research Station is an in "". It must be built on [Snow%20%28Civ6%29](Snow) or [Snow%20%28Hills%29%20%28Civ6%29](Snow Hills) next to a [Campus%20%28Civ6%29](Campus) with a [Research%20Lab%20%28Civ6%29](Research Lab).
In the "" expansion, the Amundsen-Scott Research Station is unlocked with [Rapid%20Deployment%20%28Civ6%29](Rapid Deployment).
Strategy.
The bonuses the Amundsen-Scott Research Station provides are very powerful and affect the owner's entire empire, and will help tremendously when pursuing a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Science](Science Victory). Building it is a struggle, butÂ some forward planning makes it easier. Especially on larger [Map%20%28Civ6%29](maps), settling and growing a city which will eventually cover at least one Snow tile is a little difficult since most of the workable tiles will be [Tundra%20%28Civ6%29](Tundra), and if you have 5 Snow tiles in a city for the full bonus the city isn't going to be very productive.
The easiest way to construct this wonder is with a [Great%20Engineer%20%28Civ6%29](Great Engineer) like [Gustave%20Eiffel%20%28Civ6%29](Gustave Eiffel) or [Shah%20Jah%C4%81n%20%28Civ6%29](Shah Jahan). If you miss out on them, however, you should be able to build the Amundsen-Scott Research Station within an acceptable number of turns by boosting the city's through purchases and s. Assigning [Reyna%20%28Financier%29%20%28Civ6%29](Reyna) with [Contractor%20%28Civ6%29](Contractor) or [Moksha%20%28Cardinal%29%20%28Civ6%29](Moksha) with [Divine%20Architect%20%28Civ6%29](Divine Architect) (in "") to the city in which you want to build this wonder is also highly recommended, since these [Governor%20%28Civ6%29](Governors) allow you to buy your Campus, [Industrial%20Zone%20%28Civ6%29](Industrial Zone), and [Harbor%20%28Civ6%29](Harbor) outright.
The Amundsen-Scott Research Station is easier to build when playing as [Russian%20%28Civ6%29](Russia) or after building [St.%20Basil%27s%20Cathedral%20%28Civ6%29](St. Basil's Cathedral), both of which increase the bonuses of Tundra tiles. [Canadian%20%28Civ6%29](Canada) also has a slightly easier time building this wonder, as they can construct [Farm%20%28Civ6%29](Farms) on Tundra tiles and mitigate the disadvantage of having a city on less-than-ideal terrain, and at least one of their Tundra cities should be adjacent to Snow regions. If a city already has St. Basil's Cathedral, then it should be well-established by the Atomic Era and able to build the Amundsen-Scott Research Station fairly quickly.
