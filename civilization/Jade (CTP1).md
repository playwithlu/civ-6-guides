Nephrite and jadeite, both indiscriminately called jade, have long been revered as carved ornaments. Yet the more practical ancients used the harder-than-steel stones to make weapons and axes. For eight thousand years or longer, Jade has also had religious significance for the people of China and Asia. The Emerald Buddha, for example, a two-foot statue composed of imperial jade, has for hundreds of years been considered the most holy relic in Thailand.
