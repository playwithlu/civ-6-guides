Before the establishment of a paper credit system in the 14th century, no Bank building existed specifically for exchanging monies. In the time of Christ, for instance, money lenders gathered before the temple, loaning money to citizens who lacked the cash for their weekly religious offering. Later, 14th century banks, called "bruges" in Belgium, operated as semi-pub places for merchants and bankers. The age of money had arrived.
