# Happiness (CTP2)

Gameplay.
Each city has an individual Happiness rating that indicates how satisfied citizens are with their lives. The empire-wide Happiness indicator reflects the general disposition of one's empire as a whole. Wise leaders will maintain the Happiness of their people by providing them with as much {{LinkCTP2|Food}}, as short a {{LinkCTP2|Workday}} and as high a {{LinkCTP2|Wage}} as possible. They can increase Happiness with religion- and entertainment-oriented {{LinkCTP2|Improvements}}. Other factors, such as {{LinkCTP2|Pollution}}, war and {{LinkCTP2|Overcrowding}} of {{LinkCTP2|Cities}} also have an impact on Happiness.
The disposition of one's citizens is an important thing to monitor in Call To Power II. An effective leader strives to act in the best interests of his or her people, and always has their Happiness in mind. Leaders who do not meet the needs and desires of their people cultivate an embittered, resentful, and even angry populace. These citizens begin protesting and rioting to express their discontent. Eventually, if their cries go unanswered, they rise up in {{LinkCTP2|Revolution}} and take control of their own destinies.
