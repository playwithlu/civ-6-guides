# Submarine (Civ4)

The following units can be upgraded to Submarine:
Strategy.
Submarines are invisible to most units. They can explore rival territory and can carry special units, but are visible (vulnerable) to enemy [Destroyer%20%28Civ4%29](Destroyers) and other submarines, especially [Attack%20Submarine%20%28Civ4%29](Attack Submarines), which gain a +50% strength bonus against regular Submarines.
[Airship%20%28Civ4%29](Airships) also have the ability to detect Submarines, but they lose this ability when upgraded to [Fighter%20%28Civ4%29](Fighters). Because Airships can no longer be produced after [Flight%20%28Civ4%29](Flight) is discovered, it may be advisable to keep some older Airships around, in order to detect enemy Submarines.
