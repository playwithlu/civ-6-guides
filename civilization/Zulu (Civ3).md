The Zulus are a playable [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ3](civilization) in "[Civilization%20III](Civilization III)". They are led by [Shaka%20%28Civ3%29](Shaka).
The Zulus are [Expansionist%20%28Civ3%29](Expansionist) and [Militaristic%20%28Civ3%29](Militaristic). They start the game with [Warrior%20Code%20%28Civ3%29](Warrior Code) and [Pottery%20%28Civ3%29](Pottery), and build [Impi%20%28Civ3%29](Impis) instead of [Spearman%20%28Civ3%29](Spearmen).
Unique Unit: Impi.
When Shaka took control of the Zulu, the first thing he did was to reorganize the army and devise new tactics. Rather than relying on traditional methods of attacking (i.e., lobbing spears at enemies from a distance), Shaka outfitted his Impi with short-handled, long-bladed assegai spears which forced them to fight in close quarters. His tactical brilliance is also evident in the use of complex flanking formations where the strongest group of soldiers ("the chest") would engage the enemy while two columns of "horns" would circle the enemy and attack from behind. The Impi routinely traveled 50 miles per day or more, and under Shaka's leadership, they crushed all opposition from neighboring tribes.
The Impi is an upgraded version of the spearman. It requires no resources to build, and allows the Zulus to quickly build a strong, mobile defense force.
Attack: 1 Defense: 2 Move: 2 (Spearman has 1)
