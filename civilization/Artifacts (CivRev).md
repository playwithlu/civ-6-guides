# Artifacts (CivRev)

Artifacts are tiles scattered around the world in "[Civilization%20Revolution](Civilization Revolution)". They contain hidden [List%20of%20units%20in%20CivRev](units), [List%20of%20technologies%20in%20CivRev](technologies), and other valuable bonuses.
Finding Artifacts.
Although the artifacts are hidden, they are not invisible and can be easily seen when the [fog%20of%20war](fog of war) has been cleared. The artifacts themselves are placed randomly on the [Map%20%28CivRev%29](map) but are usually located in isolated areas and islands. While most are accessible by a [Galley%20%28CivRev%29](Galley), the [Lost%20City%20of%20Atlantis%20%28CivRev%29](Lost City of Atlantis) is almost always too far from land, requiring [Navigation%20%28CivRev%29](Navigation) or [Steam%20Power%20%28CivRev%29](Steam Power) to be reached. (Unlike the other artifacts, which require some kind of [Ground%20unit%20%28CivRev%29](ground unit) to enter them to be unlocked, Atlantis does not; just having a [Naval%20unit%20%28CivRev%29](naval unit) adjacent to it will suffice.)
At the beginning of the game, visiting [Native%20village%20%28CivRev%29](native villages) is a good idea as in return for your offering of education or herbal medicine, they will quite often tell you of remaining artifacts nearby. This will pop up on your screen as a message from your [Advisor%20%28CivRev%29](Foreign Advisor); "The villagers seem to believe that there are at least two hidden artifacts yet to be found," or the location of a "hidden temple" will be revealed (you will briefly see the artifact and its approximate location). The location of an artifact may be indicated through the fog by a humming sound when the location indicator is passed over the spot where the artifact is. Finally, if your [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20CivRev](civilization) is the first to discover [Space%20Flight%20%28CivRev%29](Space Flight), the entire map is revealed, including any undiscovered artifacts.
