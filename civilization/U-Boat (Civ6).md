# U-Boat (Civ6)

The U-Boat is a [Unique%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](unique) [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Naval%20raider](naval raider unit) of the [German%20%28Civ6%29](German) [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It replaces the [Submarine%20%28Civ6%29](Submarine).
Strategy.
The U-Boat is a slightly cheaper version of the Submarine with a situational Combat Strength bonus and the ability to reveal invisible units coming slightly earlier than a [Destroyer%20%28Civ6%29](Destroyer). It is the weakest piece in the German arsenal - not because there's anything inherently wrong with it, but because it replaces a unit that doesn't come into play very often for a number of reasons and fixes none of the problems with this unit. (Read more [Submarine%20%28Civ6%29%23Strategy](here).) The U-Boat is a rather underwhelming unit overall, and in the expansions, German players will most likely build it just for the [Era%20Score%20%28Civ6%29](Era Score) bonus: Germany doesn't excel at coastal raids like [Norwegian%20%28Civ6%29](Norway) or the [Ottoman%20%28Civ6%29](Ottomans), and while the U-Boat is strong against other [Naval%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](naval units), it is much less effective against [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) than the [Battleship%20%28Civ6%29](Battleship). However, [Letters%20of%20Marque%20%28Civ6%29](Letters of Marque) helps players produce this unit a bit faster and makes it slightly more potent by giving it a +2 bonus, and it doesn't consume like a standard Submarine, which helps its owner save a bit for other units or to use on .
