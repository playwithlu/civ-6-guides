# Bireme (Civ6)

TheÂ Bireme is a [Unique%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](unique) [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Naval%20melee](naval melee unit) of the [Phoenician%20%28Civ6%29](Phoenician) [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) in "". It replaces the [Galley%20%28Civ6%29](Galley).
Strategy.
Since the Galley (or overall, any naval melee units in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)" that are not under [Harald%20Hardrada%20%28Civ6%29](Harald Hardrada)) has a really limited scope of usage in battle, the Bireme, which is a version of the Galley with improved stats, also serves mostly the same purpose: defending and scouting. If you are playing on a water-dominated [Map%20%28Civ6%29](map) where there are several [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) whose [City%20Center%20%28Civ6%29](City Centers) are adjacent to multiple [Coast%20%28Civ6%29](Coast) tiles (at least 2, ideally 3 or more), you can wage an all-out war just by using a group of Biremes themselves with little resistance thrown back at you, due to the Bireme's improved stats compared to the regular Galley. Otherwise, the only offensive purpose this unit can serve is occasionally plundering some s, which does not happen often and you surely do not want to cause a ton of just for that.
Similarly to the [Mandekalu%20Cavalry%20%28Civ6%29](Mandekalu Cavalry), the Bireme can protect Phoenician Traders on water, but it is unrealistic to be able to move this unit around to follow the s, especially considering the "legion" of cities Phoenicia will have, their discounted unique [Harbor%20%28Civ6%29](Harbor), the [Cothon%20%28Civ6%29](Cothon), and even more s from the [Government%20Plaza%20%28Civ6%29](Government Plaza). It is a mechanic that is just "there" without any practical implications.
