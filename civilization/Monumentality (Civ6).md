Strategy.
Monumentality is one of the best choices of Golden Age policy card in the early game when you really need to expand and build up your infrastructure as quickly as possible, as it allows the use of {{Faith6}} to purchase [Settler%20%28Civ6%29](Settlers) and [Builder%20%28Civ6%29](Builders). In the Classical and [Medieval%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Medieval Era), Settlers tend to be prioritized due to the heavy emphasis on expansion, while Builders are more important in the Renaissance Era for improving and building upon the foundation you've laid. It also effectively doubles the {{Moves6}} of the standard Builder and Settler, helping them achieve their goals a lot faster (both on land and on water). This card can be used to its fullest extent by [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) who focus on building a healthy {{Faith6}} output very early on, and particularly those who have religious tendencies but not aggressive ones, such as [Ethiopian%20%28Civ6%29](Ethiopia), [Georgian%20%28Civ6%29](Georgia), and the [Khmer%20%28Civ6%29](Khmer).
