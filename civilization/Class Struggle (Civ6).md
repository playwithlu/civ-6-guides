# Class Struggle (Civ6)

Class Struggle is a [Modern%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Modern Era) [Civic%20%28Civ6%29](civic) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It can be hurried by building 3 [Factory%20%28Civ6%29](Factories).
Strategy.
Class struggle emerges, at the start, as an intellectual exercise of some philosophers. But, amazingly, in less than 50 years real life gives the concept flesh, and many people around the world recognize the truth of those philosophers. The idea that a small elite is actually in command of wealth, and exploiting the large mass of people to get more wealth quickly becomes obvious at the turn of the 20th century - after all, how can it not be obvious when the grimy, bone-tired workers go to work in their dirty, smoky factories, and return every night to their indistinct, poor homes, filled with stuff they have produced, but their masters have profited from?
Across the developed world, people decide to do something about it. And we see the formation of unions, the first strikes, and the actual struggle these philosophers were talking about, when the police starts beating up and arresting the strikers. In some parts of the world, however, people go further - they embrace the system proposed by these philosophers and make themselves 'proletarian states'. Thus is the third type of modern government born: [Communism%20%28Civ6%29](Communism). And again, new Policies replace outdated ones.
