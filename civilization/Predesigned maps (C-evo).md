# Predesigned maps (C-evo)

Fans of the free-to-play game [C-evo](C-evo) have created dozens of [map%20%28C-evo%29](map)s for other players to enjoy. See http://c-evo.org/files/files.php for downloadable versions. Also, from the main menu screen in v 1.2 you may click the logo at top left to see a menu, on which the top item is "Configurator": its subtitle is "Change language, add maps and AIs"; you can add maps directly from its map tab.
Listed on website.
Some are listed below, in order of posting date:
[pIX%20MAPs%20%28C-evo%29](pIX MAPs)
"[world%20map%20%28C-evo%29](world map)" - much of the Northern Hemisphere
[Concept-Equal%20%28C-evo%29](Concept-Equal)
"Total Fairness Maps" - described thus: "A set of maps on which all players have (almost) the same conditions. Maybe too boring to play, but perfect for AI testing: Watch different AIs evolve parallel in identical environment. The maps have a different character ranging from early clash to complete separation before air transport is available. Package update: Three new maps!"

[World%20Map%20%28C-evo%29](World Map)
MIFUDD_[2ContinentsNormalMap14%20%28C-evo%29](2ContinentsNormalMap14) - 56% size, 15 players

[Cartwheel%20map%20%28C-evo%29](Cartwheel map) (224% size) - 8 nations; the "Concept-Equal" principle taken even further, though the starting positions are not precisely the same. Each subcontinent has equal access to the other seven through the central area, which needs several units to block it. Mine those mountains before you reach size 12, and your capital may want another forest eventually. Use navigation. Defend with air units if playing "Hard". More than the standard six rare mineral tiles.
Later maps from Configurator.
Several others are available from the Configurator menu as noted above. They include:
