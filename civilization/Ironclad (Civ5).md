Strategy.
Ironclads are the first steam-powered warships available and the heralds of the new era of engine-based naval warfare. The Ironclad is purely a combat vessel: relying on very thick armor and powerful short-range cannons, they are harder to kill than any sailing vessel and their combat strength is much higher than that of sailing ships. These qualities prove especially useful when assaulting [Coastal%20%28Civ5%29](coastal) [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities) of the [Era%20%28Civ5%29](era), whose defenses simply cannot deal with the Ironclad's thick armor.
Their main drawback is their slower speed in [Ocean%20%28Civ5%29](ocean) tiles when compared to the [Renaissance%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Renaissance Era) ships. Use them primarily for in-shore defense and to assault cities.
