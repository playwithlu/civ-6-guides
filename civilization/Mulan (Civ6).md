# Mulan (Civ6)

Mulan is a [Heroes%20%26amp%3B%20Legends%20%28Civ6%29%23Heroes](Hero) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". She is exclusive to the [Heroes%20%26amp%3B%20Legends%20%28Civ6%29](Heroes &amp; Legends) [Game%20mode%20%28Civ6%29](game mode), introduced in the [Babylon%20Pack%20%28Civ6%29](Babylon Pack).
Strategy.
Like all Hero units, Mulan's {{Strength6}} Strength increases with the progression of the [Era%20%28Civ6%29](eras), as shown in the table below.
Mulan can be one of the stronger military Heroes in the game. With her high mobility and ranged attack, she can act like a very mobile ranged or siege unit.
While she doesn't have any bonus against [Walls%20%28Civ6%29](Walls), if she lives long enough she can get a high enough {{Strength6}} Strength to damage even heavily fortified [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) easily. To maximize her potential, build a [Shrine%20%28Civ6%29](Shrine) to extend her {{LifespanIcon6}} Lifespan, or play as [Gilgamesh%20%28Civ6%29](Gilgamesh) for his bonus to Hero {{LifespanIcon6}} Lifespan.
