# FreeCol versions

[FreeCol](FreeCol) has had a score of released numbered versions since the project started in 2002.
It devotes a web page to nearly every release, linking to them on its [http%3A//www.freecol.org/news/releases.html](Releases) page.
Four new nations; new sound effects and terrain graphics; units slide (somewhat jerkily) instead of jumping. But the big thing is reportedly the ability to use XML to define gameplay mechanics.
"Standalone servers are restarted automatically" after a win; "fixes several bugs".
Bug-fixes, notably allowing the King's forces to land after you declare independence. Should accept saved games from 0.9.0 and possibly earlier.
Bug and feature fixes: native land claims revert to the moderate level of 0.9.0; Privateer combat improved. Backward-compatible with other 0.9.x saved games.
Bug-fixes, notably the "capture despite armed defender" bug. Better and more keyboard accelerators. The first graphical "mod" to be part of a release.
Several bug-fixes, notably a leak that was causing 0.9.3 to go slow. A graphical modification ([mod](mod)) by misiulo adds new graphics for goods and resources. Translations for various languages much improved. 
Several bug-fixes, including the plugging of more leaks that were causing previous versions to go slow.
The alpha "fixes many old bugs and adds numerous new features" - but has its own bugs as an alpha tends to; "should be able to read all 0.9.x savegames"
The alpha-2 on 10 April 2011 fixed a few problems.
The final release lists at least six features that bring FreeCol closer to [Col1](Col1).
Released.
0.10.x.
A relatively new feature may pop up at the end of a turn inviting you to reconsider units that might be able to move further. Excellent idea, and will be excellent in practice when it manages to avoid wasting your time asking about units that cannot move in any way, notably ships under repair but commonly also units that have only one movement point left but are in the middle of hills, mountains, or other "2-point" tiles.
"The FreeCol team are relieved to announce the release of FreeCol 0.11.4. While many bugs were fixed in this release, there has also been progress in completing the required feature set for the 1.0 release. All 0.10.x and 0.11.x games should continue to work with 0.11.4."
"For more detail, see the [http%3A//sourceforge.net/p/freecol/wiki/0.11.4%2520Release%2520Notes/](release notes)."
