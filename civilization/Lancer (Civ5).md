# Lancer (Civ5)

Game Info.
[Renaissance%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Renaissance Era) mounted unit. Upgrades from the [Pikeman%20%28Civ5%29](Pikeman). Requires {{Horses5}}.
Strategy.
The Lancer is a mixed purpose unit: it's more powerful than the [Knight%20%28Civ5%29](Knight) or the Pikeman and it can perform most of their functions better. It receives the first Formation [Promotions%20%28Civ5%29](promotion) by default, granting a 33% strength bonus against mounted units (in "").
Any remaining units will lose their speed upon conversion to [Anti-Tank%20Gun%20%28Civ5%29](Anti-Tank Gun) companies, so promotion may be tricky. There is the exception that one may be further upgraded to a [Helicopter%20Gunship%20%28Civ5%29](Helicopter Gunship).
In [vanilla](vanilla) "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)", the Lancer doesn't receive any hard combat bonuses against mounted units. Instead, it can outpace them by 1 {{Movement5}} (total of 4) and can catch retreating enemy cavalry even after they retreat.
However, this version of the Lancer is also strictly an offensive unit; the same spear that allows it to perform powerful charges when attacking is too unwieldy for defense and nets the unit a combat penalty when defending. Like other mounted units, when stopped they can be quickly destroyed by ranged units. Cautious utilization of the extra {{Movement5}} is wise.
