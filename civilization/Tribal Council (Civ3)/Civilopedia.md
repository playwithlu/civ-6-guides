# Tribal Council (Civ3)/Civilopedia

A tribal council is a simple governmental organization wherein various groups or “tribes” of people (often
sharing common cultural traits) select a person to represent their interests in a gathering of spokesmen from
other tribes. These tribal representatives will often gather around large campfires or within structures such
as teepees (i.e., Native Americans) and discuss issues and solve problems affecting the entire social group.
