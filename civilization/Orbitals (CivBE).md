# Orbitals (CivBE)

Orbitals, also known as satellites, are a new type of [Units%20%28CivBE%29](unit) in "" that are launched from [City%20%28CivBE%29](cities) and operate on their own layer of the [Planet%20%28CivBE%29](map). Orbital units may provide bonuses to the [Terrain%20%28CivBE%29](tiles) below them, manipulate [Miasma%20%28CivBE%29](miasma), perform ranged attacks, or even transport units across the map.
Orbital units usually are built in cities, but they occasionally can found by [Explorer%20%28CivBE%29](Explorers) within [Resource%20pod%20%28CivBE%29](resource pods). Most orbital units require to build.
An orbital unit must be launched into the orbital layer before it takes effect. With the notable exception of the [Rocktopus%20%28CivBE%29](Rocktopus), orbital units cannot be moved once launched.
Orbital Coverage.
Orbital coverage is the area in which a player is able to launch satellites. Orbital units built in a particular city may be placed anywhere a player has orbital coverage, even if it is halfway across the map. Orbital units cannot be placed in an area that overlaps the radius of an existing orbital unit. The one exception to this rule is the [Abyssal%20Mirror%20%28CivBE%29](Abyssal Mirror). This [Wonders%20%28CivBE%29](wonder) allows orbital units launched from city in which it is constructed to overlap the coverage area of other Orbital Units by 1 tile.
Each city has a base Orbital Coverage range of 4 [hex](hex)es. Several buildings, wonders and [Personality%20traits%20%28CivBE%29](personality traits) can increase this range.
In the "" expansion, orbital coverage can be found outside a city's radius. Players gain orbital coverage around deposits - even those that are covered by [Alien%20Nest%20%28CivBE%29](Alien Nests) - when they reach a level of 5. The [Comm%20Relay%20%28CivBE%29](Comm Relay) satellite expands orbital coverage by 5. Using this satellite allows players to leapfrog satellites across the map. When players purchase the Orbital Cooperation [Trade%20Agreements%20%28CivBE%29](trade agreement) from other civilizations, they gain orbital coverage around the [Station%20%28CivBE%29](stations) of the map.
Attack bonuses under orbital coverage.
Players who chose the integrated personality trait gain and when under friendly Orbital coverage.
De-orbiting.
Orbital units can be de-orbited (destroyed) in a few ways:
Duration.
The duration of an orbital unit can range from 10 [turn](turn)s to 60. When the duration of any orbital unit except a Rocktopus ends, it crashes into the planet's surface leaving a [Crashed%20Satellite%20%28CivBE%29](Crashed Satellite). An Explorer can conduct an [Expedition%20%28CivBE%29](expedition) on the wreck for bonuses.
The Spacefaring [Personality%20traits%20%28CivBE%29](personality trait) increases the duration of orbital units by 20/30/40%. The [Quantum%20Computer%20%28CivBE%29](Quantum Computer) wonder increases a unit's duration by 50% while also providing free maintenance for all orbital units. In [vanilla](vanilla) "Beyond Earth", the [Slavic%20Federation%20%28CivBE%29](Slavic Federation's) orbital units receive a 50% duration bonus.
Anti-Orbital Strikes.
Orbital units can be shot down by cities and artillery units. Tier 1 versions of these units can shoot units within a 1-hex radius. Tier 2 versions can shoot 2 hexes away.
The following units can use the anti-orbital strike ability:
Cities have a default anti-orbital radius of 2 hexes. The following buildings and agreements that increase orbital strike range:
Orbital units that are launched within the orbital strike range of enemy cities or units are usually shot down. However, orbital units usually are allowed to use their abilities the same turn they are launched. This allows players to launch a [Phasal%20Transporter%20%28CivBE%29](Phasal Transporter), beam in 6 hexes worth of units deep into enemy territory or launch a [Planet%20Carver%20%28CivBE%29](Planet Carver) to add one more attack to an offensive before the orbital unit is shot down.
Rocktopus.
The , a unique unit, is an orbital unit with special mechanics. The option to de-orbit manually is offered as a perk after Level 16 is reached. 
Slavic Federation.
The Slavic Federation is a [Sponsors%20%28CivBE%29](sponsor) that specializes in orbital units.
