# Home city

The "home city" is an attribute of [unit](unit)s in earlier "[Civilization%20%28series%29](Civilization)" games and spinoff titles which links them to the [city](city) that created them. Depending on the [Civilizations](civilization)'s [government](government), a city can support a number of units for free, but additional units incur [Maintenance](maintenance costs) in the form of diverted [Production](Production) output. Home cities also determine the [trade%20route](trade route) established by .
When a city is captured by a rival, all supported units are instantly destroyed; subverting a city through [espionage](espionage) can retain supported units for the new controller.
Units created outside of cities (e.g., by [goody%20hut](goody hut)s) determine their home city by the nearest settlement: if the player has no cities, or the closest city is controlled by a rival civ, no home city is assigned () and the unit will incur no maintenance.
Home cities are reassigned by stationing the unit in the desired host city and selecting the appropriate order ("Set Home City"/"Support From This City" or equivalent).
Home cities do not feature in "[Civilization%20III](Civilization III)" and later games.
