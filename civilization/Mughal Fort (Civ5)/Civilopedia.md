# Mughal Fort (Civ5)/Civilopedia

The Mughals were an Islamic empire that invaded India in the 15th century, and ruled most of the sub-continent until the mid 19th. During their rule, they constructed elaborate forts across the countryside which served as administrative centers and living quarters for the occupiers. These forts were beautiful structures, fitting palaces for the rulers of a vast empire. Several--including the magnificent "Lahore Fort" and [Red%20Fort%20%28Civ5%29](Red Fort) of Agra--survive today and remain as some of the largest tourist attractions to India, monuments to the Mughals' power and style.
