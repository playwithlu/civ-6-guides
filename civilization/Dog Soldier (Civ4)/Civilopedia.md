# Dog Soldier (Civ4)/Civilopedia

The Dog Soldiers were the elite of the Cheyenne warriors and some of the most feared fighters in the American West. Members of a prestigious fraternal society, the Dog Soldiers each received a "Dog Sash" upon entrance into the group. While at first merely emblems of membership, the "Dog Sash" soon became a symbol of iron will in combat. This reputation stemmed from the Dog Soldier habit of, during particularly brutal combat, staking themselves to the ground by way of their "Dog Sash" and not moving from the spot until victory or death had overtaken them.
