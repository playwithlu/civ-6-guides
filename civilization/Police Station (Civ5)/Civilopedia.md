# Police Station (Civ5)/Civilopedia

A police station provides the base of operations for local police and detectives, typically housing office space, in addition to a small jail, interrogation rooms, and evidence storage areas. In some regions, a larger central office may contribute many of these facilities while smaller sub-stations serve as the primary post for local police departments.
