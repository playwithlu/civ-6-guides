# Automated Workforce (Civ6)

BUT: -1 {{Amenity6}} and -5 [Loyalty%20%28Civ6%29](Loyalty) per turn in your cities.
Automated Workforce is a [Dark%20Age%20%28Civ6%29](Dark Age) [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "". It is available from the [Information%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Information Era) to the [Future%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Future Era) and uses a {{WildcardSlotIcon6}} Wildcard slot.
Strategy.
Automated Workforce will help your [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) garner {{Production6}} for [Project%20%28Civ6%29](projects), which is especially helpful when seeking a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Science](Science Victory). The {{Amenity6}} and [Loyalty%20%28Civ6%29](Loyalty) penalties can make it risky to adopt if one of your neighbors is in a {{GoldenAge6}} and/or has multiple well-developed cities near your border, but strategic placement of your [Governor%20%28Civ6%29](Governors) will lessen the danger.
