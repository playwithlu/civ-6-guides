# Military Readiness (CTP2)

 is a game concept in "[Call%20to%20Power%20II](Call to Power II)".
Gameplay.
The Military Readiness setting determines the support costs of existing units and affects their health ratings. There are three military readiness states: At War, On Alert and At Peace. 
When At War, all units are fully trained and ready to fight. They incur full support costs and have full health (until attacked).
On Alert status has reduced support costs. Because of this, unit health suffers a decrease, reflecting the lower level of support.
The At Peace setting reduces unit support costs and health even further. Therefore, although units are cheaper to maintain at lower readiness levels, they are not as equipped for battle.
It takes several turns to change military readiness settings. Leaders should consider this when planning their military activity.
