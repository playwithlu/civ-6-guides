Gameplay.
On [Earth%20%28map%29%20%28Civ1%29](Earth), the Romans start in [Italian](Italy), and are often surrounded by other powers. The blue/purple civilization to the north will be either [French%20%28Civ1%29](France) or [German%20%28Civ1%29](Germany), and they may have the [Greek%20%28Civ1%29](Greeks) boxing them in too.
Other powers that the Romans may face early in the game include the [Egyptian%20%28Civ1%29](Egyptians) and [Babylonian%20%28Civ1%29](Babylonians). At least two powers will need to be defeated or relocated in order to forge the Roman Empire as depicted in the map at the right. The Russians will not appear because they and the Romans share the same color.
