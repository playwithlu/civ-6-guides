# Liberalism (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Although liberalism as a political philosophy would come to the fore later in the “Age of Enlightenment,” its roots lie in the Glorious Revolution in England of 1688 AD. As a result, John Locke and Algernon Sidney were among several English philosophers who argued for a new worldview founded on the principles of liberty and equality, that government’s primary purpose was to protect its citizens’ liberty, lives and property – even from itself. Thus, spurred by the Renaissance and Reformation, liberalism promoted freedom of speech, the press, religion, markets, and the freedom to enjoy most of the deadly sins. Conservatives have had their knickers in a twist ever since.
