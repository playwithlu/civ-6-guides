# Fighter (Civ4)

The following units can be upgraded to Fighters:
Strategy.
Fighter units can attack enemy [Air%20unit%20%28Civ4%29](air units) and can scout enemy terrain. They are very useful when stationed on [Carrier%20%28Civ4%29](Carrier) units.
Missions.
Fighters can weaken city fortifications and harm units with Air Strike attacks, though not as effectively as [Bomber%20%28Civ4%29](Bombers). Using the Intercept mission, Fighters can help protect cities and units from deadly Air attacks.
