# Arena (Civ6)

The Arena is a basic [Amenities%20%28Civ6%29%23Entertainment](entertainment) [Building%20%28Civ6%29](building) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is built in the [Entertainment%20Complex%20%28Civ6%29](Entertainment Complex) [District%20%28Civ6%29](district) (or one of its replacements).
Strategy.
The Arena comes in handy for increasing in a growing empire. Remember that in order to achieve the bonus to yields in a [City%20%28Civ6%29](city), each city needs to have at least 2 more that it requires...so the more "extras," the better (although if a city has more than five, the effect stops growing).
