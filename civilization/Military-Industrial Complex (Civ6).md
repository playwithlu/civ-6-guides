Strategy.
Military-Industrial Complex is one of the best choices for a smaller [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization), or one that lacks late-game [Resource%20%28Civ6%29%23Strategic](strategic resources). It is also a great choice for civs that use [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Ranged](ranged units) (or have a [Unique%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](unique) ranged unit) or just like quality over quantity when it comes to their military. Squeezing out a few extra [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](units) that need or while enhancing the quality of said units can easily give someone a winning edge in wartime.
