In-Game.
Boudicca speaks a formal dialect of modern , which was most likely chosen as her language because it is the closest surviving linguistic relative of the language spoken by her tribe. On her diplomacy screen, she is standing next to a chariot outside a hill fort in an area akin to the Scottish Highlands. (This, however, is historically inaccurate, as the Iceni tribe was located in what roughly corresponds to the East Anglia region of England and not Scotland.) She is dressed in tartan and wields a sword, which she angrily thrusts into the chariot when defeated.

Intro.
Eternal glory and praise for you, fierce and vengeful Warrior Queen! In a time dominated by men, you not only secured your throne and sovereign rule, but also successfully defied the power of the Roman Empire. After suffering terrible punishment and humiliation at the hand of the Roman invaders, you rallied your people in a bloody and terrifying revolt. Legions fell under your chariot wheels and the city of London burned. While in the end the Romans retained ownership of the isles, you alone made Nero consider withdrawing all troops and leaving Britain forever.
Oh sleeping lioness, your people desire that you rise and lead them again in the calling that is your namesake. Will you meet their challenge on the open field and lead the Celts to everlasting victory? Will you restore your lands and build an empire to stand the test of time?
