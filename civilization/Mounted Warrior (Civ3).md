# Mounted Warrior (Civ3)

[Iroquois%20%28Civ3%29](Iroquois) Mounted Warriors take the place of [Horseman%20%28Civ3%29](Horsemen). They move quickly and will withdraw from combat if they are losing (unless fighting another fast unit).
A city must have horses in its Strategic Resource box to build a mounted warrior.
