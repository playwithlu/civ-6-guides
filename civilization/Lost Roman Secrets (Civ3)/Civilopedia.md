# Lost Roman Secrets (Civ3)/Civilopedia

During the transition to first a divided Empire, and then the collapse of the Western Empire, many architectural secrets of
the Romans were lost to the Byzantines, and Europe in general. In order to provide the populace the conditions it was accustomed
to, the Byzantines frequently had to relearn techniques, such as building aqueducts, that had once been commonplace. Despite these efforts, 
though, it would not be until the eighteenth century C.E. that the average European regained the standard of living enjoyed by the 
average Roman citizen.
