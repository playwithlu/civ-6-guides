Gifts of the Nile is a [List%20of%20scenarios%20in%20Civ6](scenario) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)" that was released with the [Nubia%20Civilization%20%26amp%3B%20Scenario%20Pack%20%28Civ6%29](Nubia Civilization &amp; Scenario Pack).

Gameplay.
This is a timed scenario in which you control either [Amanitore%20%28Civ6%29](Amanitore) of [Nubian%20%28Civ6%29](Nubia) or [Cleopatra%20%28Civ6%29](Cleopatra) of [Egyptian%20%28Civ6%29](Egypt). You compete against both your rival in the Nile River Valley and six non-playable [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) (which have no civilization or leader abilities, but pay no maintenance for their [Units%20%28Civ6%29](units)) that will menace your empire as it grows.
In addition to the many special features, there are some key differences between this scenario and a standard game:
The scenario begins with the [Pyramids%20%28Civ6%29](Pyramids) prebuilt near the [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-state) of [On%20%28Civ6%29](On), which can be captured to receive their benefits. The [Great%20Library%20%28Civ6%29](Great Library), [Great%20Lighthouse%20%28Civ6%29](Great Lighthouse), and [Jebel%20Barkal%20%28Civ6%29](Jebel Barkal) can also be built once a civilization completes the necessary research.
The scenario lasts for 125 turns, and the first player to build 7 [Temple%20to%20Amun%20%28Civ6%29](Temples to Amun) before time runs out wins.
