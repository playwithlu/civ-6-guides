# Nuclear Espionage (Civ6)

Nuclear Espionage is a Diplomatic [Policy%20Cards%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
If you've been lagging in [Technologies%20%28Civ6%29](technological) research when Nuclear Espionage becomes available, slotting it will help you regain some lost ground. While it's active, every tech boost one of your [Spy%20%28Civ6%29](Spies) steals without being caught will trigger a second , making it particularly devious in conjunction with an [Intelligence%20Agency%20%28Civ6%29](Intelligence Agency) or a Spy with the [Technologist%20%28Civ6%29](Technologist) .
This card has to be a priority for [Babylonian%20%28Civ6%29](Babylon), who get two free technologies out of it every time they succeed in a Steal Tech boost mission.
