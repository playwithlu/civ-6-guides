The bombing of strategic targets from the air dates back to the beginning of World War I, when the Germans used zeppelins to bomb Paris and London. Because zeppelins proved to be extremely vulnerable, they were withdrawn from war in favor of airplanes. By the end of World War I, planes were being designed specifically as bombers.
