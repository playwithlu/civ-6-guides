# National Epic (Civ4)

Strategy.
The National Epic greatly increases the rate at which its city produces Great People, particularly [Great%20Artist%20%28Civ4%29](Great Artists).
This wonder should be built on your best [Food%20%28Civ4%29](food) city so you may work the greatest number of [Specialists%20%28Civ4%29](specialists) and produce the greatest number of [Great%20Person%20%28Civ4%29](Great People). Civic switch to [Caste%20System%20%28Civ4%29](Caste System) and [Pacifism%20%28Civ4%29](Pacifism) for maximum effect.
