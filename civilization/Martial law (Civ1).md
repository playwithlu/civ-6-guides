# Martial law (Civ1)

In the original "[Sid%20Meier%27s%20Civilization](Sid Meier's Civilization)", martial law is a mechanism of quelling [Citizen%20%28Civ1%29](citizens') discontent available under [Anarchy%20%28Civ1%29](Anarchy), [Despotism%20%28Civ1%29](Despotism), [Monarchy%20%28government%29%20%28Civ1%29](Monarchy) or [Communism%20%28government%29%20%28Civ1%29](Communism). Martial law allows the ruler to turn unhappy citizens content by stationing up to 3 military [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ1](units) inside the [City%20%28Civ1%29](city). Each unit makes 1 citizen content, but no more than 3 in total (additional units will have no effect on the population's mood).
Units eligible to impose martial law are any units with an attack of 1 or more including [Naval%20unit%20%28Civ1%29](ships) and [Air%20unit%20%28Civ1%29](air units).
Note that in the first MS-DOS version of "Civilization" (version 474.01/475.01) the limit of 3 units is not present, and any number of unhappy citizens can be quelled by enough military units.
