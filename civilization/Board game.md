# Board game

A board game (or boardgame) is a game played with counters or pieces that are placed on and/or moved around a board according to a set of rules. Board games both inspired and have been inspired by the "[Civilization%20%28series%29](Civilization)" games.
Civilization.
The board game named "Civilization" (1980) by [Francis%20Tresham](Francis Tresham) inspired [Sid%20Meier](Sid Meier) to create the original "[Sid%20Meier%27s%20Civilization](Sid Meier's Civilization)" (1991) computer game. Coincidentally, the board game received an expansion named "[Advanced%20Civilization%20%281991%29](Advanced Civilization)" in 1991, too.
Sid Meier's Civilization: The Boardgame.
"Sid Meier's Civilization: The Boardgame" was published by [http%3A//www.eaglegames.net](Eagle Games) and released in 2002. It was built on the fundamentals of Sid Meier's "Civilization" series, recreating the atmosphere of the original PC game.
The game is available in its native English, Spanish, and German, while translations of the rulebook are also available in Italian, French, and Dutch.
A group of fanatics of this board game has also created a brand new rulebook named Creator House Rules (CHR) that recreates a more strategic and realistic play experience by using the original game box contents. If you want to play with rules closer to the original PC game, you should consider CHR - see below for a download link, as well as pictures of a game in progress to get a better idea of how it plays.
