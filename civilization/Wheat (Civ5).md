Game Info.
Bonus resource.
Strategy.
 Wheat is found in [Plains%20%28Civ5%29](Plains) and [Desert%20%28Civ5%29](Desert) regions, making it very important for [Arabian%20%28Civ5%29](Arabia) and [Moroccan%20%28Civ5%29](Morocco) (both of which are native to deserts). It is the only bonus resource which can be improved right from the start of the game, because its [List%20of%20improvements%20in%20Civ5](improvement) is the [Farm%20%28Civ5%29](Farm), which is available without any need of [List%20of%20technologies%20in%20Civ5](technology) research.
