# Industrial Zone Logistics (Civ6)

Extra {{Engineer6}} points at completion
Industrial Zone Logistics is a [Project%20%28Civ6%29](project) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It becomes available after building an [Industrial%20Zone%20%28Civ6%29](Industrial Zone) [District%20%28Civ6%29](district) (or one of its replacements).
This project organizes infrastructural work in the city with the expertise of the engineers from the Industrial Zone, converting 15% of its {{Production6}} output to {{Gold6}}. When completed, it yields {{Engineer6}} points equal to approximately 22% of the {{Production6}} invested in it (on Standard [Speed%20%28Civ6%29](speed)).
In "", this project provides the city with full {{Power6}} instead of {{Gold6}} - something arguably much more useful, since there are many other possible sources of {{Gold6}}. The {{Power6}} is provided at the beginning of any turn on which the project is underway.
