# Worker Housing (Civ3)/Civilopedia

The construction of massive monuments and other public works projects frequently required the services of thousands
of laborers over a period of years, sometimes “forcibly imported” from foreign lands. Thus arose the need for
semi-permanent housing for the workers. Such housing structures would normally be built so that their inhabitants
would have easy access to the work site yet. Like many ancient dwelling complexes, these housing sites usually
provided only a minimum of sanitation, if any at all.
