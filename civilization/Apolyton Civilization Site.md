# Apolyton Civilization Site

The Apolyton Civilization Site (often called Apolyton for short) is a website that provides information about and forums for discussing the "[Civilization%20%28series%29](Civilization)" and "[Call%20to%20Power%20games](Call to Power)" games. Having been online since at least September 1998, it is possibly the oldest "Civilization" site on the Internet.
