# Sacred Path (Civ6)

Sacred Path is a [Pantheon%20%28Civ6%29](Pantheon) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It increases the output of [Holy%20Site%20%28Civ6%29](Holy Site) [District%20%28Civ6%29](districts) by 1 for each adjacent [Rainforest%20%28Civ6%29](Rainforest) [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tile).
Strategy.
Although any [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) that spawns near the world's jungle belt can make use of Sacred Path, [Brazilian%20%28Civ6%29](Brazil) truly shines with it. Combined with their [List%20of%20civilization%20abilities%20in%20Civ6](civilization ability), a Holy Site fully surrounded by Rainforests will provide a massive 12 extra . Even when not going for a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Religion](Religious Victory), this massive influx can help [Great%20People%20%28Civ6%29%23Attracting%20via%20Patronage](patronize) , which plays well into [Pedro%20II%20%28Civ6%29](Pedro II's) [List%20of%20leader%20abilities%20in%20Civ6](leader ability). [Vietnamese%20%28Civ6%29](Vietnam) also can make great use of this ability due to their [Starting%20bias%20%28Civ6%29](starting bias) allowing for strong Holy Sites that otherwise wouldn't be possible because of their district placement restrictions.
One needs to be careful about how many of these Rainforests one cuts down, however! When starting in a jungle belt and not in want of a huge influx, one may consider [Goddess%20of%20Festivals%20%28Civ6%29](Goddess of Festivals) instead, as are a very common resource in Rainforests.
