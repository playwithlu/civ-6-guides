Civilopedia entry.
Explosives were discovered during experiments with Gunpowder and Chemistry in the search for stable and powerful chemicals for industrial and military applications. An Explosive is a chemical that undergoes a rapid Combustion, and produces much heat and gas. The heat causes the gas to rapidly expand, thereby exerting the pressures of an explosion. Some Explosives are mixtures of combustibles that are ignited. Others contain unstable molecules that can undergo an Explosive decomposition called a detonation. The former type is used as propellants for bullets and fireworks, while the latter is used in warheads and rock blasting.
