# Inspiration (Civ6)

Inspiration is a Wildcard [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
Inspiration is another one of the first Wildcards available in the game, and like the other ones is only usable once you discover [Political%20Philosophy%20%28Civ6%29](Political Philosophy) and adopt a [Government%20%28Civ6%29](government) with a {{WildcardSlotIcon6}} Wildcard slot (unless you're playing as [Greek%20%28Civ6%29](Greece) or [Polish%20%28Civ6%29](Poland)). Compared to the other available cards - [Revelation%20%28Civ6%29](Revelation) and [Strategos%20%28Civ6%29](Strategos) - Inspiration is perhaps the most generally useful, since it helps you get a [Great%20Scientist%20%28Civ6%29](Great Scientist) early in the game. However, think carefully about whether you want to ensure you found a [Religion%20%28Civ6%29](religion) - the [AI](AI) is pretty competitive on religions, and if you decide to go with Inspiration you will realistically get 2-3 {{Prophet6}} points (assuming you've already built a [Holy%20Site%20%28Civ6%29](Holy Site) with a [Shrine%20%28Civ6%29](Shrine) and have adopted [Classical%20Republic%20%28Civ6%29](Classical Republic)) to other [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations') 4 or more, and you may end up without your own religion!
