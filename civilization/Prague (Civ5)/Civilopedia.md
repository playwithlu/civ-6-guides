# Prague (Civ5)/Civilopedia

Widely recognized for its cultural contributions to Europe over the past millennium, the city of Prague, capital of the Czech Republic, grew from a minor settlement of the mid-8th century to a major metropolitan area of more than one million people as it stands today.
During the 14th century, Prague flourished as the seat of power for the Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV. Many of the city's most notable landmarks were constructed during his reign, including the famous St. Vitus Cathedral built in the Gothic architectural style. Prague also expanded as an economic center during this period, receiving traders and financiers from across Europe as the city's population greatly increased.
Home to a number of renowned museums, theaters, and other cultural attractions, Prague is an extremely popular tourist destination in the present day. By current estimates, more than three million visitors come to Prague each year to enjoy the sights of the historic city.
