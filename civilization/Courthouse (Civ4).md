# Courthouse (Civ4)

The Courthouse is replaced by the following [Unique%20building%20%28Civ4%29](unique buildings):
Strategy.
Courthouses reduce your expenses and grant you Espionage points.
Each Courthouse halves [Maintenance%20%28Civ4%29](maintenance) for its home [City%20%28Civ4%29](city). Maintenance increases with each further city you found, so building Courthouses helps to offset the spiralling costs. Once you have built enough Courthouses, you can build the [Forbidden%20Palace%20%28Civ4%29](Forbidden Palace), which further reduces maintenance.
Courthouses also give a bonus to espionage and enable you to have one [Spy%20Specialist%20%28Civ4%29](Spy specialist), which produces more espionage.
