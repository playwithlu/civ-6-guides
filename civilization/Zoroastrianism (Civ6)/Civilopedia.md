# Zoroastrianism (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Zoroastrianism, an ancient faith based on the teachings of the prophet Zoroaster, is believed to have been founded some 3500 years ago in the region around Persia. Once one of the largest religions in the world, Zoroastrianism is only followed today by an estimated 200 thousand adherents, living primarily in India, Pakistan, and Iran. In general, it has been marginalized and overshadowed by Islam since the decline of the Sassanid Empire after the 7th Century AD.
Zoroastrianism is considered by some to be the oldest monotheistic religion in the world, although this is a point of contention among scholars. Zoroastrian beliefs are centered on the creator god Ahura Mazda, who is the focal point of all Zoroastrian tradition and worship. It is said that Ahura Mazda revealed his wisdom to Zoroaster, who then wandered about to spread the teachings across the region. The sacred texts of Zoroastrianism, known collectively as the Avesta, contain hymns said to have been written by Zoroaster himself.
As with most religions, Zoroastrianism outlines the ways in which humans can supposedly live in harmony, in this case through “good thoughts and good actions.” Zoroastrians are often mischaracterized as fire worshippers, in part because of the prevalence of fire as a symbol in Zoroastrian rituals. In Zoroastrianism, fire represents the light of Ahura Mazda and believers will pray in the direction of the light, rather than to the fire itself.
