# Paean (CivBE)

Game info.
The Paean is a fairly useful satellite for dealing with Health issues in the mid-game. As it costs no Resources to build it can be used rapidly to pay off Health costs for citizens. Later on, they can obstruct valuable defensive orbital coverage, so they will wittle off during the late game.
