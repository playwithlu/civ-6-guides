# Future Civic (Civ6)/Civilopedia

The progress of culture is a slow and unfolding arc, and the values that define a culture evolve, ebb, and flow over time. Philosophers continue to debate great questions of antiquity today: What is a good life? How should people live moral lives? What are our rights and liberties? What is the individualâ€™s relation to the state? The evolution of technology creates new moral quandaries which must be negotiated, as well as opportunities to create both good and evil. The future must look to its own problems, while drawing on the wisdom of past ages. While we cannot know with certainty what the culture of the future will offer, we hope that this "future civic" will be a celebration of those things that bind us in a common humanity and the differences that give humanity its texture.
