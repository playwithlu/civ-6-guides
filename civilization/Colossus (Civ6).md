Strategy.
Despite being almost exactly the same as [Colossus%20%28Civ5%29](its counterpart in "Civilization V"), the Colossus in "Civilization VI" is not as strong and coveted as it used to be due to the drastic changes in the overall landscape between the two iterations. In "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)", the number of s a player can unlock is bound to the tech tree, so every player is destined to have the same number of s. The Colossus is, therefore, good because it provides an edge over your opponents that you cannot get elsewhere. In "Civilization VI", however, the maximum number of s you have depends how many settlements you have, which makes the Colossus' bonus much less impressive. Unless you spawn on a small island or near other players who block your early expansion, you can usually just train another [Settler%20%28Civ6%29](Settler) to found a new city, which will eventually provide your empire more than just a and a few per turn. Outside of these situations, the Colossus is at best an average wonder that shouldn't be too high on your priority list.
