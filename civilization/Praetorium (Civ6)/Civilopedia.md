# Praetorium (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Originally the Roman praetor’s tent in a Legion encampment, the term “Praetorium” became used more widely to refer to the building where the seat of Roman adjudication was held. It became a place where both legal proceedings and executive administration would occur, and possessed its own rituals and traditions in enacting the law.
