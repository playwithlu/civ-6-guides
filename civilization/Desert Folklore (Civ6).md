# Desert Folklore (Civ6)

Desert Folklore is a [Pantheon%20%28Civ6%29](Pantheon) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It increases the output of [Holy%20Site%20%28Civ6%29](Holy Site) [District%20%28Civ6%29](districts) by 1 for each adjacent [Desert%20%28Civ6%29](Desert) [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tile).
Strategy.
Like all pantheons that rely on specific [Terrain%20%28Civ6%29](terrain) types, Desert Folklore attempts to boost the desirability of an otherwise unappealing terrain. It requires an appropriate start and the player having more interest in than whatever other bonuses may be obtained (e.g., taking [God%20of%20the%20Open%20Sky%20%28Civ6%29](God of the Open Sky) for extra from [Pasture%20%28Civ6%29](Pastures) built on , or [Lady%20of%20the%20Reeds%20and%20Marshes%20%28Civ6%29](Lady of the Reeds and Marshes) for extra from [Oasis%20%28Civ6%29](Oases)).
This pantheon makes deserts more viable places in which to found [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities), especially when pursuing a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Religion](Religious Victory) or after adopting [Theocracy%20%28Civ6%29](Theocracy) or building the [Grand%20Master%27s%20Chapel%20%28Civ6%29](Grand Master's Chapel) to enable purchasing of military units. It has good synergy with desert-biased [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) such as [Malian%20%28Civ6%29](Mali) (with the [Suguba%20%28Civ6%29](Suguba) further lowering costs), [Egyptian%20%28Civ6%29](Egypt) (whose Holy Sites can be built more cheaply next to a [River%20%28Civ6%29](River), although [River%20Goddess%20%28Civ6%29](River Goddess) is also a reasonable choice there), and [Nubian%20%28Civ6%29](Nubia) (whose [Nubian%20Pyramid%20%28Civ6%29](Nubian Pyramid) is particularly well-suited to being built next to Holy Sites).
The district tile terrain is not taken into account (maximum bonus is +6). In this pantheon also works with Desert Floodplains (as the tiles are also marked as Desert).
