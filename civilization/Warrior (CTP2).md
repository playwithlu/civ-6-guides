Great Library.
The development of weapons almost certainly evolved from the first forays into tool making. Primitive people fashioned stone, wood and bone to assemble crude tools for digging, cutting and hunting. The first metal working primarily involved gold, silver and copper. Warriors equipped themselves with spears, swords and shields fashioned out of wood and metal. As metal and wood working technology improved, the quality of weapons improved as well.
