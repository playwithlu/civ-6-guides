# Plantation (Civ6)

The Plantation is a standard in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It requires and may only be built on certain s.
Strategy.
The Plantation is a great improvement, because it not only gives you access to the great majority of [Resource%20%28Civ6%29%23Luxury](luxury resources), but also increases (or provides) their output. It also increases by +0.5, as like [Farm%20%28Civ6%29](Farms), they provide living quarters. What's more, it doesn't destroy [Terrain%20%28Civ6%29%23Terrain%20features](terrain features) like [Woods%20%28Civ6%29](Woods) and [Rainforest%20%28Civ6%29](Rainforests) anymore, allowing them to continue conveying bonus yields to the [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tile)!
Of course, Plantations may only be built on certain resources, not wherever you please.
