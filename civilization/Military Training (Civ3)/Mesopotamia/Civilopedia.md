# Military Training (Civ3)/Mesopotamia/Civilopedia

Sun Tzu noted, "War is a moral contest that is won in the temples before it is ever
fought." This philosophy can be extended to include military training and preparedness.
Very few are born to war, and fewer still are blessed with an inherent sense of tactics
and strategy. So it is that the uneducated, undisciplined, and unruly warriors of the
ancient world needed guidance and constant, constant drilling before they could prove
their mettle on the battlefield.
