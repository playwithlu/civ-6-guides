# Military Training (Civ3)/The Rise of Rome/Civilopedia

Organized training of a nationâ€™s troops serves to further increase their ability and effectiveness.
A major factor accounting for the superiority of the Roman Legionary over his foes was the time and
effort that went into his training. In game terms, learning the art of Military Training allows
a player to build more powerful Heavy Cavalry units, and to upgrade existing Horsemen units to
Heavy Cavalry.
