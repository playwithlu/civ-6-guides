# Renaissance Walls (Civ6)

Renaissance Walls are an advanced defensive [Building%20%28Civ6%29](building) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". They are built in the and require [Medieval%20Walls%20%28Civ6%29](Medieval Walls) (or one of their replacements).
Strategy.
Renaissance Walls are the last upgrade stage of pre-modern defenses in "Civilization VI". They represent the elaborate defense systems which Renaissance engineers were forced to devise when gunpowder started to invade the battlefield, and the hitting power of modern weapons became too much for simple walls to withstand.
Renaissance Walls can withstand serious sieges from gunpowder-armed units, such as the [Musketman%20%28Civ6%29](Musketman) (even when accompanied by siege equipment), for some time, but the [Bombard%20%28Civ6%29](Bombard) will quickly wear them down. If you see an army with this type of unit, do your utmost to prevent them from using it!
As of the [Civilization%20VI%20Summer%202017%20Update](Summer 2017 Update), Renaissance Walls provide and have no maintenance cost.
