# Companion Infantry (Civ3)/Civilopedia

The Companion Infantry were the lynchpin of Alexander’s army. Organized in brigades of 1500 men, they fought
in phalanx formations (usually 8 men deep, though it could vary to 16). They were armed with “sarissa” -- pikes
ranging from 15 to 19 feet long, and carried short swords in case they engaged in melee. As one progressed further
back in the ranks, the sarissa grew increasingly longer, such that the body of men presented a formidable
“hedgehog” formation. For protection, the infantry wore a metal breastplate and helmet and carried a shield.
