# Perdiccas (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Though Perdiccas began his military career as a phalanx commander, Alexander the Great eventually appointed him the commander of the hetairoi (Companion cavalry) after Hephaestion’s death. On Alexander’s deathbed, Perdiccas was made supreme commander and regent—a position he squandered through poor politics, leading to the first war of succession.
