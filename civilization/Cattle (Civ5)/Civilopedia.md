# Cattle (Civ5)/Civilopedia

Some of the earliest domesticated animals in history, cows, oxen and other bovines have been used for livestock, dairy, and as draft animals. In addition, cattle skin has been used for leather, and its dung as a fuel source. Many tribal civilizations count a person's wealth by how many cattle he or she possesses.
