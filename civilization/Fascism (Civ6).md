In ', this government's legacy bonus is conferred by Fascist Legacy, a Wildcard [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](policy) unlocked by changing governments after adopting Fascism and constructing a Tier 3 government [Building%20%28Civ6%29](building) ([National%20History%20Museum%20%28Civ6%29](National History Museum), [Royal%20Society%20%28Civ6%29](Royal Society), or [War%20Department%20%28Civ6%29](War Department)).

Strategy.
Fascism focuses heavily on military prowess. With 4 Military cards, it has more military options than any other [Modern%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Modern Era) government in the game and all the tools a [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) needs to obtain a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Domination](Domination Victory). Its unique effects allow its adopter to build up a strong military very, very fast. Combined with certain [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader and civilization abilities), it can open up new possibilities for win conditions for civilizations like [American%20%28Civ6%29](America). Fascism's unique effects combined with both of America's [Unique%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](unique units) becoming available in the Modern Era means this particular civilization can achieve a massive mid-to-late game military power spike.
Civilizations that favored [Oligarchy%20%28Civ6%29](Oligarchy) in the [Classical%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Classical Era) may also find Fascism's similar characteristics a welcome sight. [Scythian%20%28Civ6%29](Scythia) and [Japanese%20%28Civ6%29](Japan), for instance, may make good use of Fascism's combat bonuses if they aren't pursuing another [Victory%20%28Civ6%29](victory) condition. [Greek%20%28Civ6%29](Greece) under [Gorgo%20%28Civ6%29](Gorgo) receives an automatic +9 Combat Strength for all [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](units), which can reach even higher if she fills up her Wildcard slots with Military policies.
A few civilizations might seek to utilize Fascism for a non-military reason. One is [Wilfrid%20Laurier%20%28Civ6%29](Wilfrid Laurier's) [Canadian%20%28Civ6%29](Canada), which can utilize the unit bonus provided by Fascism to train more [Mountie%20%28Civ6%29](Mounties) and found more [National%20Park%20%28Civ6%29](National Parks). Others are [Alexander%20%28Civ6%29](Alexander's) [Macedonian%20%28Civ6%29](Macedon) and [Ambiorix%20%28Civ6%29](Ambiorix's) [Gallic%20%28Civ6%29](Gaul), which can obtain and (respectively) from training units.
Note that the +5 bonus does not cover Religious Strength, so civilizations striving for a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Religion](Religious Victory) won't benefit at all from this form of government. It applies to [Nihang%20%28Civ6%29](Nihang) and [Vampire%20%28Civ6%29](Vampires) but not to [Warrior%20Monk%20%28Civ6%29](Warrior Monks) or [Giant%20Death%20Robot%20%28Civ6%29](Giant Death Robots).
