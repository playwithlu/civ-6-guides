# Volhynian (Civ6)/Civilopedia

The Volhynian families are a curiosity in the Polish-Lithuanian Union. Certainly, they are loyal, but some have refused to abandon their faith in the Orthodox Church in favor of Catholicism.
Such is the strength of the Union and its codified views of religious tolerance. They may do as they will, as long as they advance the Union's causes. And advance it they have, charging straight at all who would oppose us, making available their soldiers, fodder, and treasure when needed for campaign. Their best and brightest have commanded tens of thousands of Union soldiers to great success.
Let them worship in the way they so choose. If doing so serves to bolster their worldly faith in our cause, more the benefit for the Union.
