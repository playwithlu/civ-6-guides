Faction characteristics.
Although Svensgaard has no restrictions on the social-engineering choices available to him, an [AI](AI)-controlled Svensgaard will take offense at players using the Wealth or Knowledge values choices. This is curiously similar to [Spartan%20Federation%20%28SMAC%29](Santiago's) AI behavior.
Leader's defining quote.
"The sea ... vast, mysterious ... and full of wealth! And the nations of Planet send their trade across it without a thought. Well, the sea doesn't care about them, so it lets them pass. But we can give the sea a little hand in teaching the landlubbers a lesson in humility."
-- Captain Ulrik Svensgaard, "The Ripple and the Wave"
