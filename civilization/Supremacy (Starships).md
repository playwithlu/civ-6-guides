Ship Parts.
Armor
Armor increases the amount of damage your ship can take. (Increases your HP by 30).
Engines
Upgrading Engines increases speed and maneuverability which helps you to reach the most advantageous battle locations. 
Fighters
Small, fast, and dangerous – but extremely fragile. Your starship can launch one fighter group per battle turn.
Lasers
Lasers are long range energy weapons. Find a clean line of fire for maximum effect.
Plasma Cannon
High-energy kinetic weapons: cannons have a shorter range than lasers, but do a lot of damage.
Sensors
You can’t shoot’em if you can’t see’em. Activating your sensors will reveal any cloaked enemy starships within your sensor range.
Shields
Shields absorb energy from enemy weapons, reducing damage. Damaged shields will recover after each turn.
Stealth
They can’t shoot you if they can’t see you. When stealth is activated, you are invisible to ships outside of your stealth radius.
