# Oil (Civ6)

Strategy.
Given its large {{Production6}} bonus, increased even more when improved, {{OilIcon6}} Oil is a major boon for your [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities') {{Production6}}, especially for cities on the coast. Unfortunately, {{OilIcon6}} Oil is also quite rare (more so on land than at sea), and often on terrain normally not suitable for settlement (such as [Desert%20%28Civ6%29](Desert) or [Snow%20%28Civ6%29](Snow)).
