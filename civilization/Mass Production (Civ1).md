Civilopedia entry.
Following the advent of Industrialization, factory owners developed new techniques to make production more efficient. Henry Ford is credited with one major advance, the installation of Mass Production assembly lines in his Automobile plants. In this case, the object being assembled, a car, was carried along conveyor belts to the various workstations, where each worker expertly performed his part of the assembly. When the car reached the end of the line, it was fully built. Techniques such as this resulted in dramatic increases in worker productivity as long as the workers were content.
