# Coastal (Civ6)

In "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)" and its expansions, a coastal [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tile) is a land tile that is directly adjacent to one or more [Coast%20%28Civ6%29](Coast) or [Lake%20%28Civ6%29](Lake) tiles.
A coastal [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) (i.e., a city whose [City%20Center%20%28Civ6%29](City Center) is on a coastal tile) can produce [Naval%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](naval units), but is subject to attack by [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Naval%20melee](naval melee units). A coastal or [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](tile improvement) is subject to [Combat%20%28Civ6%29%23Pillaging](pillaging) by [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Naval%20raider](naval raider units) and any other naval unit that can perform Coastal Raids.
Thanks to the mechanics of the [Harbor%20%28Civ6%29](Harbor), it is possible to build an inland city that can build naval units like a coastal city, but is not subject to attack by naval melee units. However, such a city must be located within 3 [hex](hex)es of the coast (the maximum possible distance for district placement).
In "", a [Canal%20%28Civ6%29](Canal) can be constructed on a tile between two Coast and/or [Lake%20%28Civ6%29](Lake) tiles (or a coastal city and one such tile) to allow naval units to pass through it and increase the yield of s. In addition, coastal lowland tiles are given a Coastal rating of 1â€“3, which indicates how high they are above sea level and when they will be [Flood%20%28Civ6%29](flooded) and submerged by rising seas as the world's [Climate%20%28Civ6%29](climate) changes.
