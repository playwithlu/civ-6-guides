# Cotton (Civ5)/Civilopedia

Cotton is a plant that has been cultivated for centuries. It produces a fibrous "boll" around the seed which can be spun into yarn or thread and used to make cloth for clothing, ship sails, and other valuable material. First cultivated in India some seven thousand years ago, cotton is still the most widely used natural material for clothing manufacture today.
