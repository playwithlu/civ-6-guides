Great Library entry.
Tally's Electric Theater in Los Angeles was the first structure devoted to showing movies. Opening in 1902, Tally's and the "nickelodeons," named for their nickel admission, were aimed at the lower and middle classes. However as film gained in popularity, showmen saw the need to appeal to more affluent audiences, promising always the grandest, biggest, and most expensive show yet. By the 1920s, movie palaces sat as many as six thousand and sometimes featured live bands as well as stage shows. The magic of the motion picture soon swept the world.
