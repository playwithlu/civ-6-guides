The Persians are [Industrious%20%28Civ3%29](Industrious) and [Scientific%20%28Civ3%29](Scientific). They start the game with [Masonry%20%28Civ3%29](Masonry) and [Bronze%20Working%20%28Civ3%29](Bronze Working) and build [Immortals%20%28Civ3%29](Immortals) instead of [Swordsman%20%28Civ3%29](Swordsmen).
Unique Units: the Immortals.
The Immortals were the elite corps of the Persian army, as well as the king's personal bodyguards, and only those of Persian or Medic descent were allowed to serve. Equipped with bows, spears, a short sword, and little else, the Immortals relied on superior numbers and high morale to defeat their foes. Immortals also carried lightweight wicker "shields" that could deflect arrows, but they were of little use in melee combat against more heavily armored and better equipped forces. Ironically, they were called Immortals because they would often perish quickly in combat, only to be immediately replaced by fresh troops, giving the illusion that their forces never dropped in strength. Apparently, "Expendables" didn't have quite the same ring to it.
The Immortal is an upgraded version of the swordsman. Like the swordsman, it requires iron to build, but the bonus to its attack rating makes it a very potent offensive unit, and its defense rating of 2 rounds out its standing as a good all-purpose unit.
Attack: 4 (Swordsman has 3) Defense: 2 Move: 1
