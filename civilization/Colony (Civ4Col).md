# Colony (Civ4Col)

Like cities, Colonies are the primary building blocks of your empire. The game refers to them as "settlements" more often than "colonies."
Founding.
Any [colonist%20%28Civ4Col%29](colonist) can found a new colony. Colonies can be built anywhere except on mountains, water tiles, or right next to existing colonies.
