# Aqueduct (Civ5)

Game Info.
Classical Era growth-enhancingÂ building.
Strategy.
The progress towards creating the next in each [City%20%28Civ5%29](city) is measured in points, adding into a Food Basket. The Aqueduct speeds up population growth by 40%, transferring that percentage of the stored points directly into the next Food Basket each time a new is born. So, for example, if you needed 100 to produce your last , you'll jump-start the production of the next one with 40 instead of starting at 0. Build Aqueducts in cities that you want to grow faster, remembering that their effect will be greater in cities that have access to an abundance of .
Keep in mind that production occurs after growth, so if a city finishes building an Aqueduct on the same turn it grows, the city's store will be at 0 at the start of that turn. The best time to finish an Aqueduct is when the city has a bit less than 60% of the required for the next .
Note that the [Tradition%20%28Civ5%29](Tradition) policy tree provides free Aqueducts in your first four cities upon completion, so don't build Aqueducts in the first four cities if you're filling out this tree!
