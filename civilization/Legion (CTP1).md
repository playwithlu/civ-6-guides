Great Library entry.
The Romans revolutionized warfare with the Legion by combining new weapons and new organization. Instead of a thrusting spear, the Legionnaire carried a pair of throwing spears called pilum, and for close combat, he wielded a short sword. As he closed in on the enemy, he threw his spears. These spears were designed to break on impact with the enemy shield, weighing down the enemy's shield arm and opening the enemy soldier to attack by the Legionniare's short sword.
