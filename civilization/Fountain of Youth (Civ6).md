# Fountain of Youth (Civ6)

The Fountain of Youth is a single-tile passable {{Link6|natural wonder}} in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)" that was added in the [Maya%20%26amp%3B%20Gran%20Colombia%20Pack%20%28Civ6%29](Maya &amp; Gran Colombia Pack). Its [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tile) provides 4 {{Science6}} and 4 {{Faith6}}, as well as [Fresh%20water%20%28Civ6%29](fresh water), and +2 [Appeal%20%28Civ6%29](Appeal) to adjacent tiles.
A land [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](unit) that moves into the Fountain of Youth receives the Water of Life ability, which allows it to recover +10 [HP](HP) per [turn](turn) when [Combat%20%28Civ6%29%23Healing](healing) in any [Territory%20%28Civ6%29](territory).

Strategy.
The Fountain of Youth is fantastic if you settle near it in the early game. Its {{Faith6}} bonus is good for getting an early {{Link6|Pantheon}}, and for {{Faith6}} generation in general from adjacent [Holy%20Site%20%28Civ6%29](Holy Sites). Its {{Science6}} bonus is great for early game research, and its healing bonus is decent for war. Building an [Encampment%20%28Civ6%29](Encampment) next to the Fountain of Youth makes it extremely easy for units trained in that [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) to get the Water of Life ability.
