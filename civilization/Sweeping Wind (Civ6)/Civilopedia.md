It's said the greatest fighters plan two moves ahead. Or more, if they can manage it.
Consider the Twelfth Century CE Buddhist fighting monk, Benkei, who went as far as planning seven moves ahead, arming himself with seven weapons. Benkei's ferocity would become known throughout Japan after he disarmed 999 swordsmen attempting to cross the Goj≈ç Bridge in Kyoto. He would only be defeated by any close-combat fighter's worst enemy: a hail of arrows.
