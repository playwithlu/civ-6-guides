# Gilded Vault (Civ6)

The Gilded Vault is an advanced economic [Building%20%28Civ6%29](building) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is exclusive to the [Owls%20of%20Minerva%20%28Civ6%29](Owls of Minerva) secret society in the [Secret%20Societies%20%28Civ6%29](Secret Societies) [Game%20mode%20%28Civ6%29](game mode), introduced in the [Ethiopia%20Pack%20%28Civ6%29](Ethiopia Pack). It is built in the [Commercial%20Hub%20%28Civ6%29](Commercial Hub) [District%20%28Civ6%29](district) and replaces the [Bank%20%28Civ6%29](Bank).
Strategy.
In the early stages of "Civilization VI", you could actually have up to 2 s per city if you had both a Commercial Hub and a Harbor. However, the developers soon realized how powerful and important s were to an empire and lowered this maximum to 1 per city only. This alone gives you an idea of how amazing the Gilded Vault is to any [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization), especially those with a unique Harbor or Commercial Hub ([English%20%28Civ6%29](England), [Phoenician%20%28Civ6%29](Phoenicia), and [Malian%20%28Civ6%29](Mali)) or a heavy focus on trade ([Portuguese%20%28Civ6%29](Portugal), the [Cree%20%28Civ6%29](Cree), the [Dutch%20%28Civ6%29](Netherlands), and [Egyptian%20%28Civ6%29](Egypt)). Even cultural civilizations love this building, since having twice as many s as they normally would allows them to have a smaller and more compact empire that they can effectively defend with a smaller army, but still have enough s to send to every civilization in the game.
The extra from the Commercial Hub's adjacency bonus is also a nice and welcome extra touch. In order to unlock its respective [Historic%20Moment%20%28Civ6%29](Historic Moment), you will need a Commercial Hub with a starting adjacency bonus of +4. Besides the minor bonus from adjacent districts, Commercial Hubs can only gain bonuses from [River%20%28Civ6%29](rivers) (which is easy to do) and Harbors (which no one wants to do since you cannot have s from both districts), so it's difficult to get an adjacency bonus this high. However, with the Gilded Vault, you have strong incentives to build both districts in every city, increasing the chances of Commercial Hubs having a high adjacency bonus and providing a lot of as a consequence.
The ability to construct the Gilded Vault will supersede all other Bank replacements, so those playing as the [Ottoman%20%28Civ6%29](Ottomans) should avoid this society so they don't lose out on the bonuses from the [Grand%20Bazaar%20%28Civ6%29](Grand Bazaar). It should also be noted that despite [Ritual%20%28Civ6%29](Ritual) being available from the [Medieval%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Medieval Era) onward, the Gilded Vault still requires [Banking%20%28Civ6%29](Banking), which is a [Renaissance%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Renaissance Era) [Technology%20%28Civ6%29](technology).
