# Suzerain (Civ6)

The [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) with the most s at a [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-state), and at least 3 s, is considered that city-state's Suzerain. There can be only one Suzerain; ties are not allowed. If two or more civilizations have the same number of s at a city-state, there is no Suzerain.
The Suzerain of a city-state gets several significant benefits.
Unique city-state bonus.
This is a powerful bonus which no other city-state will provide. For example, [Buenos%20Aires%20%28Civ6%29](Buenos Aires) will cause [List%20of%20resources%20in%20Civ6%23Bonus](Bonus Resources) to act as [List%20of%20resources%20in%20Civ6%23Luxury](Luxuries) and provide +1 per type, while [Rapa%20Nui%20%28Civ6%29](Rapa Nui) will allow the construction of the [Moai%20%28Civ6%29](Moai), a unique [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](tile improvement).
Visibility.
You gain vision of all [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles) within and up to 3 [hex](hex)es outside of the city-state's [Borders%20%28Civ6%29](borders), as well as the vision of its [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](units).
Friendly territory.
Inside the city-state's borders your units are "at home." They can heal there at an accelerated rate and be upgraded.
Diplomatic allegiance.
The city-state will automatically follow its Suzerain into war and peace, matching the [Diplomacy%20%28Civ6%29](diplomatic state) of the Suzerain. In "" it will also provide +1 per turn to its Suzerain.
Diplomatic repercussions.
If the city-state gets attacked by a third party, its Suzerain will immediately gain the Protectorate War [Casus%20Belli%20%28Civ6%29](Casus Belli) against the aggressor. In "Gathering Storm", the Suzerain will also gain against it.
Resource sharing.
All of the city-state's [Resource%20%28Civ6%29](resources) are automatically exported to the Suzerain, and the Suzerain may build tile improvements in their city-state's [Territory%20%28Civ6%29](territory). Note that the Suzerain may make use of these resources, but may not (in the case of Luxuries) trade them to third parties.
Levying units.
The Suzerain may also pay to levy (i.e. take control of) the city-state's military units for 30 turns. The amount of that needs to be paid is equal to the total cost of all military units the city-state owns. [Sumerian%20%28Civ6%29](Sumeria) pays 50% less on levy costs.
It should be noted that levying units does not give the Suzerain control of any [Builder%20%28Civ6%29](Builders) or [Settler%20%28Civ6%29](Settlers) a city-state has captured, as those are [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Civilian](civilian units).
Other benefits.
[Pericles%20%28Civ6%29](Pericles') leader ability gives him a 5% bonus for each city-state of which he is Suzerain.
[Kilwa%20Kisiwani%20%28Civ6%29](Kilwa Kisiwani), a [Medieval%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Medieval Era) [Wonder%20%28Civ6%29](wonder) in "", gives its owner a 15% yield bonus from any city-state of which he or she is the Suzerain (and an additional 15% yield bonus for being the Suzerain of more than one city-state of the same type).
The [Orsz%C3%A1gh%C3%A1z%20%28Civ6%29](Országház), an [Industrial%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Industrial Era) wonder in "Gathering Storm", gives its owner +100% per turn from starting a turn as Suzerain of a city-state.
