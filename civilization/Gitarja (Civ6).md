Intro.
 Daring Gitarja, Majapahit queen of ten thousand islands, Indonesia's seas are your greatest strength. As Exalted Goddess of the Three Worlds, you shall spread your divine influence to all waters touched by the sun. Rely upon your loyal fleet, bold queen! Unleash a frightful storm upon those who bring strife to Indonesian shores.
In-Game.

Accepts Delegation from Player: Your delegation did not embarrass themselves. This speaks well of your people.

Accepts Player's Declaration of Friendship: A fortunate coincidence - I was about to ask the same. Good! The matter is settled.
Rejects Player's Declaration of Friendship: I would not go so far as to call you 'friend'. Until I know your true motives, we must remain as we are.
Denounced by Player: You call that an insult? A pathetic attempt from a crusted barnacle!
