# Frigate (Civ5)

Game Info.
Powerful [Renaissance%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Renaissance Era) ranged naval unit. Upgrades from the [Galleass%20%28Civ5%29](Galleass).Â Requires {{Iron5}}.
Strategy.
The Frigate is the dominant vessel of the Renaissance Era, the pinnacle of sail-based military technology. Its long-range cannon batteries can lay waste to both sea and land forces (if the latter are in range, of course), and are also very effective against [Coastal%20%28Civ5%29](coastal) [City%20%28Civ5%29](cities). Its iron-shod corpus is strong and at the same time allows even faster movement than the [Caravel%20%28Civ5%29](Caravel). With its ability to cross the [Ocean%20%28Civ5%29](ocean), the Frigate starts in earnest the naval contest in the game.
The Frigate is also the first vessel to require a [Resources%20%28Civ5%29](resource). Fortunately, it appears right when your front-line units are being upgraded to gunpowder units and stop requiring {{Iron5}}, so usually this is no problem.
Finally, in [vanilla](vanilla) "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)", Frigates can upgrade to [Destroyer%20%28Civ5%29](Destroyers) if they are not upgraded to [Ironclad%20%28Civ5%29](Ironclads) or if [Combustion%20%28Civ5%29](Combustion) is discovered before [Telegraph%20%28Civ5%29](Telegraph).
