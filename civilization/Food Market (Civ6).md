The Food Market is a growth-enhancing [Building%20%28Civ6%29](building) in "". It is built in the [Neighborhood%20%28Civ6%29](Neighborhood) [District%20%28Civ6%29](district) (or one of its replacements).
Strategy.
If you think trading 465 for 3 sounds like a bad deal, you're definitely right. Prior to "", there are no circumstances under which building a Food Market is preferable to building a Shopping Mall, which provides , , and some to spur you toward a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Culture](Culture Victory). The Food Market's lowered cost and increased yield in "Gathering Storm" make it somewhat better, and you may want to build one in a city with a Neighborhood if you're not going for a Culture Victory. Even then, this building is still generally a low priority for most cities, since is not exactly the most valuable resource at this point in the game. The only times you should make it a higher priority to build Food Markets are when playing as [Yongle%20%28Civ6%29](Yongle) (whose cities benefit from having the largest Population possible) or developing a city to maximize domestic yields (which usually requires a Population of 28 for all the specialty districts).
