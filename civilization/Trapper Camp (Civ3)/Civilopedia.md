Fur trading started in North America when French explorers arrived in Eastern Canada.
The French offered gifts such as metal knives and cooking equipment in return for animal
pelts (especially beaver). The demand for these products increased throughout Europe in 
the 1500s, forcing the fur traders to push west across the Great Lakes to find a sufficient supply of pelts.
