# Silver (Civ6)

 Silver is a [Resource%20%28Civ6%29%23Luxury](luxury resource) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is found in [Desert%20%28Civ6%29](Desert) and [Tundra%20%28Civ6%29](Tundra) [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles).
Strategy.
 Silver provides a considerable +3 when worked and up to +3 when improved with a [Mine%20%28Civ6%29](Mine). What's more, it appears in otherwise barren [Terrain%20%28Civ6%29](terrain), which makes it worthwhile to explore these lands and settle nearby! Make securing Silver a high priority when it appears.
