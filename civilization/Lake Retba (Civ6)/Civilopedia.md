# Lake Retba (Civ6)/Civilopedia

The “Pink Lake” gets its name from its intense, strawberry pink water. This color changes from pale pink to an alarming rusty red depending on the time of day, season, and composition of the lake. Algae living within the lake, not pollution, cause its shifting palette. For the Senegalese locals, the lake’s changing waters are simply part of everyday life.
Retba’s color is not its only unusual quality. The lake’s hypersalinic water—similar to the Dead Sea—lets a swimmer float on the lake without effort. This means that diving into the lake is not recommended. (Nor is drinking the water.)
