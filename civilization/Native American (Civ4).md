Strategy.
Troy can't hold a candle to the Native American Empire. As a defensive powerhouse with a focus on [Archery%20unit%20%28Civ4%29](archery units), the Native American Empire has a myriad of methods to defend itself. [Sitting%20Bull%20%28Civ4%29](Sitting Bull's) "[Protective%20%28Civ4%29](Protective)" [Leader%20trait%20%28Civ4%29](trait) allows the speedy construction of [Walls%20%28Civ4%29](Walls) and grants Archery and [Gunpowder%20unit%20%28Civ4%29](Gunpowder Units) bonus [Promotion%20%28Civ4%29](promotions). The [Totem%20Pole%20%28Civ4%29](Totem Pole), the Native American replacement for the [Monument%20%28Civ4%29](Monument), gives an [experience](experience) bonus to all Archery Units. And if that weren't enough, the [Dog%20Soldier%20%28Civ4%29](Dog Soldier), a replacement for the [Axeman%20%28Civ4%29](Axeman), can be produced without [Copper%20%28Civ4%29](Copper) or [Iron%20%28Civ4%29](Iron) and receives a big bonus against melee troops. Combine these defensive advantages with the plethora of [Great%20Person%20%28Civ4%29](Great People) created by Sitting Bull's "[Philosophical%20%28Civ4%29](Philosophical)" trait and you've got a defensive force that would make Priam blush.
