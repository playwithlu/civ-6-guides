Great Library entry.
Monarchy was a government in which the supreme authority was vested in a single person, usually a hereditary sovereign, who was the permanent head of state. It was the basis for most medieval empires. Monarchs provided the centralized power needed by fledgling nations in the 16th and 17th centuries. The monarch was usually the absolute ruler, the source of law and of administration. Feudal societies often thrived within a monarchy. Monarchy existed in various iterations in Asia, Africa, Latin America and Europe. Some monarchies lasted until well into the 20th century, although these later monarchies abandoned absolutism in favor of a parliamentary system.
