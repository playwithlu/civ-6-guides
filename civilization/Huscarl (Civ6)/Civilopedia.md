# Huscarl (Civ6)/Civilopedia

The huscarls (or “housecarls”) were elite soldiers, first raised as a military force by Canute; he modelled them on the quasi-mythical Scandinavian warrior-brotherhood known as Jomsvikings. Indeed, supposedly the original formation of huscarls were built around a nucleus of Jomsvikings that had come to England under famed Thorkell. Supported by a special tax, Canute maintained three “corps” (totaling 3000-4000 men) – two near London and the third near York. Armed with the usual collection of weapons and armor, the huscarls were especially adept at the “shield wall” tactic, which demanded both discipline and fortitude. Canute and other Viking rulers usually placed their huscarls in the center of the line to steady the rest of the army, or spread them along the entire front to take the initial enemy assault. Their exploits in battle were the stuff of legend; for instance, the huscarls formed the iron core of Godwinson’s army at Stamford Bridge and at Hastings.
