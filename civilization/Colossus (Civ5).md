# Colossus (Civ5)

Game Info.
City must be built on the coast.
Strategy.
The Colossus is one of the best sea-based Wonders in the game, netting you a serious boost and extending your early trade capabilities. It's a must for any [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilization) with or trading bonuses, like [Venetian%20%28Civ5%29](Venice), [Portuguese%20%28Civ5%29](Portugal), or [Moroccan%20%28Civ5%29](Morocco) (with a [Coastal%20%28Civ5%29](coastal) start), but you must rush [Iron%20Working%20%28Civ5%29](Iron Working) to get access to it, which isn't that easy. It's advisable to get [Worker%20%28Civ5%29](Worker) [List%20of%20technologies%20in%20Civ5](technologies) and maybe [Writing%20%28Civ5%29](Writing) first before taking this.
