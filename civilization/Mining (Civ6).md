# Mining (Civ6)

Mining is an [Ancient%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Ancient Era) [Technologies%20%28Civ6%29](technology) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
Mining is a starting technology which gives a civilization the means to extract mineral wealth from the land via the vital [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](improvements) [Mine%20%28Civ6%29](Mine) and [Quarry%20%28Civ6%29](Quarry). Furthermore, it enables the removal of [Woods%20%28Civ6%29](Woods) and the harvesting of deposits.
Mining is usually one of the two choices for first tech to research - you should choose it if you have any mineral-based Luxuries nearby. However, it also unlocks three later techs which permit your civilization's military advances in the late Ancient Era! So, you should also prioritize it if you have the mind to initiate early conquests, or else if you have an aggressive neighbor nearby.
