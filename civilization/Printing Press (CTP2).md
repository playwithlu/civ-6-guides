The earliest devices for reproducing multiple copies of the same text was probably performed with painstakingly engraved woodblocks. This technique dates back as early as 8th and 9th century China and Japan. The Chinese also pioneered the use of movable type, in which individual elements could be arranged and printed, in the 11th century. The complexity of China's ideographic language discouraged further development of this technique.
The earliest examples of European adoption of xylography (printing from carved woodblocks) appeared in the 14th century. Various inventors experimented with both moveable wooden type and metallographic printing, which involved impressing metal type dies into clay to create a print plate. In 1450, Johannes Gutenberg combined the use of moveable, reusable type with a press by which sharp impressions could be made many times over, on both sides of a sheet a paper. Although the next 500 years saw many developments and refinements of the mechanics of this printing technique, the fundamental process remained the same.
