# Apostolic Palace (Civ4)/Civilopedia

The Apostolic Palace, located in Vatican City, Italy, is the home of the Pope and the heart of the Catholic Church. Having only been occupied by the Pope since the breakup of the Papal State in 1871, the current Apostolic Palace is a relatively new addition to the Church's assets. Sitting adjacent to the iconic St. Peter's Square, the palace acts as the administrative center for all business of the Catholic Church. Further, it is from here that the Pope issues decrees which affect Catholics throughout the world. With nearly one in six people on Earth subscribing to Catholicism, the Apostolic Palace is the headquarters for one of the most influential organizations on the planet.
While the palace's importance as a world administrative center cannot be doubted, the Apostolic Palace also houses one of the most famous art collections on Earth. Contained within the walls of the Apostolic Palace is the Vatican Museum, which displays the works of master artisans Caravaggio, Raphael, and Da Vinci. Michelangelo's famous Sistine Chapel is also a part of the Apostolic Palace.
