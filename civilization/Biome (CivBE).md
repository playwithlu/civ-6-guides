# Biome (CivBE)

Biomes determine the look of the planet.
There are three planetary biomes in base "", with two additional ones coming out with "[Rising%20Tide](Rising Tide)". In the original game, none of these change the geology, biology, or the distribution of resources on the planet in the basic game. In the "Rising Tide" expansion pack, however, biome selection will determine the behavior, strengths and weaknesses of the inhabiting alien species.
