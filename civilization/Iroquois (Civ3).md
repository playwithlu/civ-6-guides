Civilopedia entry.
The Iroquois are Commercial and Agricultural (prior to "[Conquests](Conquests)": Expansionist and Religious). They start the game with Alphabet and Pottery and build mounted warriors instead of normal horsemen.
Unique Unit: the Mounted Warrior.
In Civilization III, the Iroquois represent all the tribes of Northern Native Americans. Though the Iroquois rarely used horse-mounted warriors in combat due to the wooded terrain they usually fought in, many other tribes frequently made use of them (notably the Sioux and other tribes of the Great Plains), and to great effect.
The Mounted Warrior is an upgraded version of the horseman. Like the horseman, it requires horses to build, but it has an additional attack point, making it one of the best mobile assault units of the early eras.
