History.
These tanks were famous for having fought in World War II against Nazi Germany and the fascist Italy Alliance Civilization, but these tanks saw very little combat against the [Japanese%20%28CTP2%29](Japanese Civilization). The Japanese deployed some imported [T-34%20tank%20%28CTP2%29](T-34 Tanks) in the battle of [Saipan%20%28CTP2%29](Saipan). The tanks came off of troop transports. In real life they were destroyed by Americans firing rocket launchers. But in this situation you would need to bring along some tanks of your own to counter the Japanese tanks. The Japanese lost the city and island of Saipan to the Americans. The Americans have occupied this island and the rest of the Northern Mariana islands ever since.
