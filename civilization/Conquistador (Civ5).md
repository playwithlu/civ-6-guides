Game Info.
[Unique%20unit%20%28Civ5%29](Unique) mounted unit of the [Spanish%20%28Civ5%29](Spanish) [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilization). Replaces the [Knight%20%28Civ5%29](Knight). Requires .
Strategy.
The Conquistador serves multiple purposes:
A great move of the Spanish civilization is to tech rush [Astronomy%20%28Civ5%29](Astronomy) soon after unlocking the Conquistador (via [Chivalry%20%28Civ5%29](Chivalry)), then send them in all directions across the oceans in search of suitable land that other civilizations have yet to colonize. They can land, scout it swiftly, deal with any potential [Barbarian%20%28Civ5%29](Barbarian) dangers, then immediately found a city! All other civilizations first have to scout with [Naval%20unit%20%28Civ5%29](naval units) or [Scout%20%28Civ5%29](Scouts), then send another wave of units and [Settler%20%28Civ5%29](Settlers) - a much slower process, during which the Spanish may claim the most suitable locations for their overseas settlements.
Note that the Conquistador's ability to found cities will be lost after it is upgraded to [Cavalry%20%28Civ5%29](Cavalry).
