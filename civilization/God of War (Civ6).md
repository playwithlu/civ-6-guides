# God of War (Civ6)

God of War is a [Pantheon%20%28Civ6%29](Pantheon) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". Whenever a player with this pantheon kills a [Military%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](military unit) within 8 [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles) of a [Holy%20Site%20%28Civ6%29](Holy Site) [District%20%28Civ6%29](district), they are awarded with bonus equal to 50% of the Combat Strength of the defeated [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](unit). (For instance, killing an [AT%20Crew%20%28Civ6%29](AT Crew), which has a Strength of 70, provides 35 .)
Note that this pantheon's bonus does not apply to kills from [Theological%20combat%20%28Civ6%29](theological combat), since [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Religious](religious units) have no Combat Strength.
Strategy.
Players who plan to go for an aggressive strategy from early on may find that God of War is a natural fit for them. It is useful against the [AI](AI), since they love building Holy Sites. Selecting the [Warlord%27s%20Throne%20%28Civ6%29](Warlord's Throne), the [Grand%20Master%27s%20Chapel%20%28Civ6%29](Grand Master's Chapel), and/or the [War%20Department%20%28Civ6%29](War Department) for their [Government%20Plaza%20%28Civ6%29](Government Plaza) will likely enhance the benefit the founder will gain from this pantheon. Acquiring complimentary military policies as quickly as you can, such as the [Strategos%20%28Civ6%29](Strategos) wildcard to get [Great%20General%20%28Civ6%29](Great Generals) faster, may also be a good idea.
If [Gorgo%20%28Civ6%29](Gorgo's) [Greek%20%28Civ6%29](Greece) takes God of War, they will gain both and when killing enemy units near Holy Sites. The [Khmer%20%28Civ6%29](Khmer) are another [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) that can go well with this pantheon together with [Warrior%20Monk%20%28Civ6%29](Warrior Monks), especially given their [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) and leader abilities (to say nothing of their [Unique%20building%20%28Civ6%29](unique building), the [Prasat%20%28Civ6%29](Prasat)). [Theocracy%20%28Civ6%29](Theocracy) may prove especially useful in this case.
Other [Leaders%20%28Civ6%29](leaders) that can make great use of this pantheon include [Gitarja%20%28Civ6%29](Gitarja), [Chandragupta%20%28Civ6%29](Chandragupta), [Tamar%20%28Civ6%29](Tamar), and [Philip%20II%20%28Civ6%29](Philip II). [Jadwiga%20%28Civ6%29](Jadwiga) is another leader that can devastate her foes with this pantheon if used wisely (also, even without selecting this pantheon for Jadwiga's [Polish%20%28Civ6%29](Poland), you can still subsequently select and deploy the Warrior Monks follower belief to fearsome effect).
[Russian%20%28Civ6%29](Russia) is yet another civilization whose unique ability and [Lavra%20%28Civ6%29](district) may possibly make a good combination with God of War. (It should be noted, though, that the [Dance%20of%20the%20Aurora%20%28Civ6%29](Dance of the Aurora) pantheon is practically tailor-made for Russia with [Peter%20%28Civ6%29](Peter) as leader.)
Crusade, or alternatively Defender of the Faith, may be a good [Religion%20%28Civ6%29%23Enhancer%20Beliefs](Enhancer Belief) to pick.
On a side note, with the "" expansion, [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29%23Dark%20Age%20Policy%20Cards](Dark Age Wildcards) have become available as an option for use in the dire situations that [Ages%20%28Civ6%29%23Dark%20Age](Dark Ages) are liable to generate for your civilization if it is unlucky enough to fall into one. Two of particular interest to aggressive players and/or militaristic players are [Twilight%20Valor%20%28Civ6%29](Twilight Valor) and [Elite%20Forces%20%28Civ6%29](Elite Forces), either of which will give your forces an edge during a Dark Age, albeit at a price. The former card is available during Dark Ages that occur from the [Classical%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Classical) to the [Renaissance%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Renaissance Eras), while the latter card can be employed during Dark Ages that hit during the period from the dawn of the [Industrial%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Industrial Era) up until the early [Information%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Information Era).
