# Rathaus (Civ4)/Civilopedia

In German towns and cities the Rathaus was a central location used primarily for town council meetings and other official business. It was also used as a large meeting space for interest groups as well as for other activities, depending on the town's policies.
Germany has several famous rathauses, including the Rathaus Schöneberg. The Rathaus Schöneberg was built in the Berlin borough of Tempelhof-Schöneberg between 1911 and 1914 before Schöneberg was absorbed by Berlin. After World War II, the Rathaus Schöneberg served as the temporary seat of government for West Berlin. Upon the destruction of the Berlin wall in 1989 the Rathaus reverted once again to its original function as City Hall of Schöneberg.
