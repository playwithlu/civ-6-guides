# Plains (Civ1)

Plains are open areas that differ from [Grassland%20%28Civ1%29](Grassland) in having poorer soil but better resources of timber and minerals. They are poor [Food%20%28Civ1%29](food) producers unless [Improvements%20%28Civ1%29](irrigated). Due to the presence of [Production%20%28Civ1%29](resources) and the automatic irrigation a new [city%20%28Civ1%29](city) gets, they make good choices for city sites. Plains may be converted into [forest%20%28Civ1%29](forests) by [Settlers%20%28Civ1%29](Settlers).
Plains produce 1 food and 1 resource. [Horses%20%28Civ1%29](Horses) can be found on plains, generating an extra 2 resources (and another with [Railroad%20%28improvement%29%20%28Civ1%29](Railroad)).
It costs 1 Movement Point to travel onto a Plains region.
