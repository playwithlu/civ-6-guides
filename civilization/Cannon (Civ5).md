# Cannon (Civ5)

Game Info.
Siege unit of the [Renaissance%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Renaissance Era). Upgrades from the [Trebuchet%20%28Civ5%29](Trebuchet).
Strategy.
The Cannon is an important midgame siege unit, the first one to use gunpowder as propellant. Its power is significant, and its cannonballs carry sufficient power to punch through the strongest [Medieval%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Medieval-era) [City%20%28Civ5%29](city) defenses with ease.
Although the technological principles behind Cannons are radically different from earlier siege units, they still suffer from all the same drawbacks as their predecessors: they are heavy and bulky to move, need to prepare before firing, and prove unreliable against moving targets. Use them primarily in sieges, or as ranged weapons from well-defended vantage points.
