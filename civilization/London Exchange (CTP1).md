Great Library entry.
Though officially founded in 1773, the London Stock Exchange evolved from the coffee houses of 17th century London where traders first met to raise money and shares for joint stock trading companies. In 1773, in response to growing business, traders opened the London Stock Exchange on Threadneedle Street. By the middle of the 19th century over twenty other exchanges had opened in Britain, but the London Stock Exchange remained a center of international commerce through the 21st century.
