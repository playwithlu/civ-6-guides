Montezuma I (c. 1398 AD – 1469 AD) was the fifth of [Tenochtitlan](Tenochtitlan) and second of the . He is known for greatly expanding Aztec territory, as well as consolidating Tenochtitlan's supremacy as the dominant partner over and in the . He leads the [Aztec%20%28Civ6%29](Aztecs) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Montezuma is an aggressive expansionist who pushes out his empire in order to collect all the [Resource%20%28Civ6%29%23Luxury](Luxuries) he can.
Intro.
 Tlatoani Montezuma, keep your eagle warriors happy and fed, and they will forever fight for your cause. As your Aztec empire unfurls across the land, you will never want for people to raise your walls, for you will be blessed with new, loyal workers as you conquer those around you. Go forth; Huitzilopochtli calls.
In-Game.
Montezuma's unique [Agenda%20%28Civ6%29](agenda) is Tlatoani. He likes [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) who have the same luxury resources as him and dislikes civilizations who have luxuries which he does not possess.
Montezuma's [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader ability) is Gifts for the Tlatoani. It causes luxury resources in Aztec [Territory%20%28Civ6%29](territory) to give an to two extra [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities). [Military%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](Military units) receive +1 Combat Strength (and [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Religious](religious units) receive +1 Religious Strength) for each different luxury resource improved in Aztec lands. Luxuries obtained from [Great%20Merchant%20%28Civ6%29](Great Merchants) (i.e., , , , and ) count toward this leader ability, but luxuries from trading or [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-states) (i.e., and ) do not.
Detailed Approach.
The Aztecs will be a warmonger throughout the game, but they should have plenty of to handle any [War%20weariness%20%28Civ6%29](war weariness) that develops. Their initial push will be to defeat enemies with their [Eagle%20Warrior%20%28Civ6%29](Eagle Warriors), allowing those enemy units to morph into Aztec [Builder%20%28Civ6%29](Builders). These Builders then serve as fuel for a rapid expansion of Aztec cities, utilizing their unique ability to use Builder charges on construction. Ultimately they want as wide an empire as possible since any extra Luxuries they can capture will increase their further and provide stronger attack boosts.
