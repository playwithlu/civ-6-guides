Civilopedia entry.
The Romans are [Militaristic%20%28Civ3%29](Militaristic) and [Commercial%20%28Civ3%29](Commercial). They start the game with [Warrior%20Code%20%28Civ3%29](Warrior Code) and [Alphabet%20%28Civ3%29](Alphabet) and build [Legionary%20%28Civ3%29](Legionaries) instead of normal [Swordsman%20%28Civ3%29](Swordsmen).
Unique Unit: the Legionary.
Roman Legionaries were well trained, well equipped, and well paid. In fact, it's a good thing they were paid so well, because Legionaries were required to pay for regular maintenance of their equipment out of their own pockets! Equipped with a short sword (gladius) or throwing spear (pilum), clad in steel plate armor and a bronze helmet, and wielding a large shield, a Roman Legionary was a fearsome sight indeed. Well known for their offensive potency, Legionaries were equally adept at holding their ground, relying on clever defensive tactics and superior equipment.
The Legionary is an upgraded version of the swordsman. Like the swordsman, it requires iron to build, but it has an additional defensive point, making it one of the most formidable defenders of the early and Middle Ages, on par with pikemen.
