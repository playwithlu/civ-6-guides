With the rise of Mass Production in the Industrial Age, the balance of power between owners and workers swung too far in favor of the owners. The rising worker class often found themselves stuck in poor working and living conditions while the owners grew rich. In response to this inequity the Labor Union arose, an attempt by the workers to bind their interests together and collectively bargain with ownership for better working conditions and economic status. After much turmoil, the Labor Unions were able to achieve a working balance of power with ownership and improve the worker's lot.
