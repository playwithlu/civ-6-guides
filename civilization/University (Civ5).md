# University (Civ5)

Game Info.
Science building of the [Medieval%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Medieval Era). Requires [Library%20%28Civ5%29](Library).
Strategy.
The University increases the {{Science5}} output of the [City%20%28Civ5%29](city), besides providing the first {{Scientist5}} specialist slots for your empire. The University is even more effective if the city is near [Jungle%20%28Civ5%29](jungle) tiles - they receive +2 {{Science5}} output each! Players that have lots of jungle should research [Education%20%28Civ5%29](Education) as soon as possible and build Universities in the respective cities first, then assign {{Citizen5}}s to work them. Improve those tiles with [Trading%20Post%20%28Civ5%29](Trading Posts) (or [Brazilwood%20Camp%20%28Civ5%29](Brazilwood Camps), if playing as [Brazilian%20%28Civ5%29](Brazil)) for additional {{Gold5}} output. Trading Posts could also yield additional {{Science5}} later on if you adopt the [Social%20policies%20%28Civ5%29](social policies) in the [Rationalism%20%28Civ5%29](Rationalism) tree.
Players are advised not to improve any sources of {{Bananas5}} near a city with a University - they grow in jungles and yield a {{Food5}} benefit even without being improved with a [Plantation%20%28Civ5%29](Plantation), so if the native jungle tile is preserved, it can yield both {{Food5}} and {{Science5}}.
You need a University in every city in order to build [Oxford%20University%20%28Civ5%29](Oxford University).
