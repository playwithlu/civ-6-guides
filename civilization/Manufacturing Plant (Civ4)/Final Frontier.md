# Manufacturing Plant (Civ4)/Final Frontier

Strategy.
The Manufacturing Plant increases {{Production4}} output in this Star System, allowing it to complete construction more quickly. It requires that a Factory already be built on the Planet.
Civilopedia entry.
Industrial efficiency is a critical component in a Star System's success or failure. Waste, whether in the form of unnecessary labor, harsh pollutants or errors in production can cost a Star System dearly. Manufacturing Plants do away with the inefficiencies of factories. A combined production facility, recycling plant and residency, the Manufacturing Plant can reach a level of production no simple factory could ever hope to achieve.
