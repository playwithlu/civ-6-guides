# Radio (Civ5)

Game Info.
The Radio is the first modern communication device able to really connect the world together, and thus usher it into the era of modern communications. Its waves can travel vast distances in seconds, and without the need of any physical infrastructure, allowing unparalleled opportunities for exchange of information.
The technology is best represented by the [Broadcast%20Tower%20%28Civ5%29](Broadcast Tower), a building that spreads an empire's culture in the best way possible.
