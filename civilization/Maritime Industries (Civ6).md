# Maritime Industries (Civ6)

Maritime Industries is a Military [Policy%20Cards%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Strategy.
This early Military Policy is only valuable if you are a seafaring [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization) with access to the sea, and a desire to develop a navy. In this case, Maritime Industries provides a whopping 100% boost to all earlier ships! However, even then you shouldn't keep the Policy in your [Government%20%28Civ6%29](government) permanently, but only until you finish building your navy. As usual, try to concentrate on that with all [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) capable of building ships, so that you can replace the Policy with something more useful.
If you are in no particular rush to conquer the seas, you shouldn't use this Policy at all. There are many better alternatives to your early Military Policies, which will not only save you valuable time, but also expand your other gameplay opportunities.
