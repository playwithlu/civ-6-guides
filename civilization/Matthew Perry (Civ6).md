Matthew Perry can be [Great%20People%20%28Civ6%29](retired) to grant enough {{Envoy6}}s to become [Suzerain%20%28Civ6%29](Suzerain) at a [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-state), then removes all other players' {{Envoy6}}s.
Strategy.
After Matthew Perry's tour of duty comes to an end, his ability can instantly make you Suzerain of a city-state. It can be used to obtain a key buffer city-state, claim one that complements your strategy, or steal one that's crucial to an opponent's game plan. The only drawback is that the city-state needs to have at least one [Coast%20%28Civ6%29](Coast) or [Ocean%20%28Civ6%29](Ocean) tile within its [Borders%20%28Civ6%29](borders) to allow Perry access.
