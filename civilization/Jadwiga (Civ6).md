# Jadwiga (Civ6)

Jadwiga (1373 â€“ 17 July 1399) was from 1384 until her death. Through her to , she set the foundations for the of the , and fostered the of [Lithuanian](Lithuania), Europe's last nation. She leads the [Polish%20%28Civ6%29](Poles) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Jadwiga's Poland is a flexible power that has strengths in both the military and religious arenas. Don't settle too close to her [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) for she can steal frontier [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles) from you through her [Fort%20%28Civ6%29](Fort) or [Encampment%20%28Civ6%29](Encampment) [Culture%20Bomb%20%28Civ6%29](Culture Bomb).
Intro.
 Pious Jadwiga, praise be to the glory of God, the earth, and Poland! Most holy King, you will show your people the truth and the light, and they will move beyond to spread the word to others. Protected by great winged warriors, you will rise to meet any challenge you face with a devout grace unmatched by any other.
In-Game.
Jadwiga's unique [Agenda%20%28Civ6%29](agenda) is Saint. She focuses on building up and likes civilizations that do the same. She dislikes those with low output.
Her [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader ability) is Lithuanian Union. Any foreign city losing its [Territory%20%28Civ6%29](territory) to a Polish Culture Bomb will be converted to Poland's [Religion%20%28Civ6%29](religion). She also gains +4 and +2 and from Relics, and her [Holy%20Site%20%28Civ6%29](Holy Site) [District%20%28Civ6%29](districts) have increased [Adjacency%20bonus%20%28Civ6%29](adjacency bonuses).
Detailed Approach.
Poland is a multi-faceted civilization that possesses strong military capabilities that can be repurposed for other means. One of their Military Policy slots is converted to a Wildcard slot, allowing them to recruit a [Great%20Prophet%20%28Civ6%29](Great Prophet) earlier than other civs and establish a Religion. In addition, creation of Forts and Encampments allows them to gain free tiles through their Culture Bomb ability. And with Jadwiga in charge, cities that lose tiles to Jadwiga also convert to her Religion. So even when Jadwiga plays militarily, perhaps choosing [Government%20%28Civ6%29](governments) with Military slots and fortifying her frontier, Poland should still be very strong on the religious and economic fronts.
