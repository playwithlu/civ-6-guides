Great Library entry.
Medical drugs have existed as long as people have been sick. Renamed "folk remedies," herbs and natural foods provided medicine to the sick for thousands of years. In the 19th century, new techniques in organic chemistry led to powerful painkillers and anesthetics, and in the next century, antibiotics and psychotropic medications. These new drugs revolutionized medicine and led to the rise of the drug store.
