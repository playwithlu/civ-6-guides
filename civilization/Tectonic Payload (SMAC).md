# Tectonic Payload (SMAC)

 is a unit missile payload type in "[Alien%20Crossfire](Alien Crossfire)".
Game info.
The Tectonic Payload weapons package can be used to create Tectonic Missiles. It can be used only with the chassis.
A Tectonic Missile detonation causes an earthquake that raises the target terrain by 1-4 level of altitude, depending on the type. A Fission reactor raises the terrain one level, a Singularity reactor up to four levels. Tectonic missiles are considered delivery platforms instead of combat units, and so may not target bases or units.
