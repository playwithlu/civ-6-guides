Most of the plays of William Shakespeare were first performed at London's Globe Theatre during the 1600s. Shakespeare's Theatre offered people a diversion from their own troubles, delighting them instead with the tragedies, comedies, and triumphs acted out on stage. Similar theaters, such as the Comedie Francaise in Paris, and La Scala, the famed opera house of Milan, fulfilled similar roles, by offering entertainment to the citizens of their cities.
