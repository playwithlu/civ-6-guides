# Mekewap (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Made from birch bark, the mekewap was a long-term shelter for the Cree intended to lodge many people. The Cree carefully laid out the wood into a dome shape, then wrapped wooden strips around the shelter. They then wove the strips together for warmth, further securing it from the elements. This careful construction prevented rain from permeating the shelter.
The mekewap were not portable, but thankfully, they were relatively easy and quick to build.
