Great Library entry.
Robotics, the fusion of mechanical and computational sciences, revolutionized automation. Although automated factories first appeared in the late 20th century, hardware or software failures, high costs, and slow progress plagued the early factories. By the mid 21st century, new Robotic plants offered "virtual sensors" to monitor hardware and intelligent software to rapidly program new behaviors. Using virtual reality gear, managers trained the robots in virtual space.
