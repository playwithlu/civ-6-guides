Strategy.
As a domination powerhouse with 2 unique units, Hungary under Matthias Corvinus has much stronger synergy with the Black Army than its upgrade, the [Husz%C3%A1r%20%28Civ6%29](Husz√°r), despite its bonus being more unwieldy. Hungary is a unique domination civilization since they are reliant on levying [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-states') troops to be effective, the Black Army makes the Hungarian edge in [Medieval%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Medieval-era) combat even sharper by playing right to its strength: starting with higher Combat Strength than a standard Courser and getting even stronger with every adjacent levied unit. Remember that units levied by Hungary receive an extra 2 , so your mercenary army will have no problem of keeping up with the Black Army to sustain this bonus. You can use the Black Army to do all the work thanks to their outstanding strength, or just use the levied army to protect the number of your own units and use the Black Army to pillage or claim strategic hexes in the back.
