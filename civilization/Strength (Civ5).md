# Strength (Civ5)

Strength is a rough measurement of the fighting prowess of a [Unit%20%28Civ5%29](unit) in "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)". There are two different types of Strength, which can be modified by factors such as [Promotions%20%28Civ5%29](promotions) and [Terrain%20%28Civ5%29](terrain):
Strength should not be confused with [Hit%20Points](Hit Points) (HP), which determine how much damage a unit can sustain before dying.
