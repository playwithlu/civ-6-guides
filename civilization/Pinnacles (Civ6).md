# Pinnacles (Civ6)

The Pinnacles are a single-tile impassable available in the [List%20of%20scenarios%20in%20Civ6](scenario) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". The Pinnacles occupy a tile, and provide +1 , +1 , and +2 to each adjacent tile.
Strategy.
Like other impassable wonders, the Pinnacles wonder tile offers no benefits, and cannot be developed or improved. However, its tile provides +1 and +1 to up to six adjacent tiles; these yields are cumulatively worth considerably more than the dead tile. It is usually worth incorporating single-tile wonders within city borders to maximize their yields.
