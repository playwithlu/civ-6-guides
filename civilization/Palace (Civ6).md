# Palace (Civ6)

The Palace is a special [Building%20%28Civ6%29](building) that serves as your seat of government in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It is built automatically in the [City%20Center%20%28Civ6%29](City Center) of a [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization's) current .
Strategy.
The Palace is, as usual, critical for your initial development. And it is built automatically - you don't need to do anything to enjoy its benefits! Thanks to it, your will almost always be more efficient than any other [City%20%28Civ6%29](city), so you shouldn't be surprised that it shows better qualities than other cities.
If your original is captured, the Palace will be rebuilt in the remaining city with the highest Population. If you manage to recapture your original , the Palace will not move back, resulting in you having two s: one called Original Capital and the other New Capital. At this point, the original serves only to defend against a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Domination](Domination Victory), while the new receives all the bonuses that come with the Palace, plus those that come with the title (e.g., [Loyalty%20%28Civ6%29](Loyalty), [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-state) bonuses from s, and the Palace Guard Combat Strength bonus). Also, the status also belongs to the new (i.e., wherever the Palace currently is) when [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](policy cards) like [Colonial%20Offices%20%28Civ6%29](Colonial Offices), [Colonial%20Taxes%20%28Civ6%29](Colonial Taxes), [Victoria%20%28Civ6%29](Victoria's) [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader ability), the [Mission%20%28Civ6%29](Mission), the [Royal%20Navy%20Dockyard%20%28Civ6%29](Royal Navy Dockyard), and the [Casa%20de%20Contrataci%C3%B3n%20%28Civ6%29](Casa de Contrataci√≥n) are considered. In addition, if [Phoenician%20%28Civ6%29](Phoenicia) has two s, [Dido%20%28Civ6%29](Dido's) [Move%20Capital%20%28Civ6%29](Move Capital) [Project%20%28Civ6%29](project) will move the Palace and the status of the new , while the original remains static for the sole purpose as a condition for the Domination Victory.
