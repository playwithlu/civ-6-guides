It may be somewhat helpful if you try to focus all your into one central [City%20%28Civ6%29](city), which is likely to be the case when you're going for a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Science](Scientific Victory), but since it's only available until the Modern Era and prevents you from establishing [Magnus%20%28Steward%29%20%28Civ6%29](Magnus) to make use of [Vertical%20Integration%20%28Civ6%29](Vertical Integration), it's liable to do more harm than good.
