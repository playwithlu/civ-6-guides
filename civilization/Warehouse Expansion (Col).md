# Warehouse Expansion (Col)

Normally, a warehouse can hold up to 200 of each cargo type. Your carpenters can construct an expansion to the warehouse, which adds another 100 to the total capacity. A warehouse with an expansion looks exactly like the normal warehouse, but a "2" is superimposed on it.
