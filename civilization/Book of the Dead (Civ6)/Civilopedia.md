# Book of the Dead (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Books of the Dead were collections of funerary instructions offering both practical advice for the treatment of corpses and ritual incantations designed to guide the recently deceased through the Underworld. Those who could afford to commission them kept a copy in their tombsâ€”a readily available afterlife instruction manual.
