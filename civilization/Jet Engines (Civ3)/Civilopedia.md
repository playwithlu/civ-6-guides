# Jet Engines (Civ3)/Civilopedia

A Britisher named Frank White designed the first working jet engine in 1930. However, it
was the Germans during WWII that mass-produced the first jet combat aircraft, the Me-262,
which began to see service in 1944. In order to assist their Pacific partner, the Germans
provided working plans for their jet and its high-performance engines to the Japanese.
Armed with the German blueprints, the Japanese developed the Kikka (Orange
Blossom), a close cousin to the Me-262. Unfortunately for Japan, it was a case of "too
little, too late."
