Great Library entry.
Artillery was a fearsome development in the early 20th century battlefield. Artillery guns replaced cannons as the preferred heavy weapon that shot explosive shells over considerable distances. Over the first decades of the 20th century, artillery evolved as a devastatingly effective anti-personnel weapon. In the Russo-Japanese War of 1905, artillery accounted for ten percent of casualties. By World War I, that number rose to seventy percent. It was not a flawless weapon, however. It was relatively easy to fortify buildings and installations to sufficiently defend against artillery fire.
