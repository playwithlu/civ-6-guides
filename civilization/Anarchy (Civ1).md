Civilopedia entry.
Anarchy is a breakdown in government resulting in the absence of political authority or any cohering purpose. The government ceases to function, along with any services it provides. While anarchy has been seriously proposed as an
alternative to government, it has never achieved more than fringe acceptance. Anarchy has occurred at various times in history following great social upheaval caused by revolution, war, natural disaster, or disease. In almost every case, anarchy meant panic, disruption, waste, and destruction.
