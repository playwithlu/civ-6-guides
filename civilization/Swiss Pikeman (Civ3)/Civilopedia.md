# Swiss Pikeman (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Mercenaries first came to prominence in Europe in the 14th century, when soldiers from the Hundred Years' War preferred to 
continue fighting for a living rather than learn peacetime trades. Swiss soldiers in particular enjoyed an especially high 
reputation for loyalty and professionalism, and several European nations incorporated Swiss mercenary regiments into their armies. 
The most famous assignment of Swiss mercenaries is the personal safety of the Pope; a special unit of Swiss soldiers, the Swiss Guard, 
has pledged to protect the Pope and the Vatican for the last 500 years.
