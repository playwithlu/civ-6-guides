# Giant's Causeway (Civ6)

The Giant's Causeway is a two-tile impassable available in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)" with the . The Giant's Causeway occupies one and one land tile (either a or ). Each wonder tile provides +1 and 2 to adjacent tiles.
A land [Military%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](combat unit) that moves adjacent to the Giant's Causeway receives the Spear of Fionn ability, which grants it a permanent, one-time bonus of +5 Combat Strength.
In "", discovering the Giant's Causeway grants +1 [Era%20Score%20%28Civ6%29](Era Score), or +3 Score if the player is the first to do so.
Strategy.
Like most natural wonders that grant [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](unit) bonuses, building a [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) close to the Giant's Causeway is a good idea, if only to keep other [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) (or [Barbarian%20%28Civ6%29](barbarians)) from using it. Build an [Encampment%20%28Civ6%29](Encampment) next to it, and every unit trained in the city will automatically gain the Spear of Fionn ability.
While the Giant's Causeway is impassable, it is not a [Mountains%20%28Civ6%29](Mountain), and ranged units can shoot over it.
