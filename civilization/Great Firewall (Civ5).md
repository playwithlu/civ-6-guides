# Great Firewall (Civ5)

Strategy.
The Great Firewall is a Wonder for anti-spy fanatics who detest having technologies stolen. It will practically stop all enemy spies acting on your soil in their tracks. As an added (and much more useful) bonus, the Great Firewall negates the [The%20Internet%20%28Civ5%29](Internet) technology of enemies, making your nation far less susceptible to the end-game cultural push.
The Great Firewall is also worth having if you yourself are going for a [Cultural%20victory%20%28Civ5%29](culture victory) - not for the advantages it provides, but because it prevents anyone else from having them.
