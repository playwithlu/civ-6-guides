The key to Dumbarton’s history – at least, according to local historians – is the double pointed plug of volcanic rock sticking up over the countryside. As early as the Iron Age, its strategic location was recognized. The first documented evidence of a settlement at Dumbarton is a letter St. Patrick wrote to Ceretic, king of Strathclyde and Alcluith c. 450 AD. For the next few centuries, the history of the town is unclear. However, by 870 Dumbarton Rock was a nice little British fortress and settlement, seemingly prosperous and peaceful. But then the Vikings arrived, a force under Ivar Beinlaus en route from sacking York; Olaf the White joined him from Ireland. Together they besieged the town for 15 weeks, before finally storming it, burning it, and carrying off everything not nailed down – including the survivors – in a fleet of 200 longships back to Ireland.
