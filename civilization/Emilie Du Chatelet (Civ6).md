Unique ability.
Triggers the for 3 random from the Renaissance or Industrial era.
Strategy.
The three most expensive Industrial Era technologies are 930 Science each, so Emilie provides at most 3*930*0.4=1116 science. Another Renaissance Era Great Scientist, [Galileo%20Galilei%20%28Civ6%29](Galileo Galilei), provides 250 science for each adjacent mountain tile. Therefore, Galileo Galilei is always a better choice if he can be activated with 5 adjacent Mountain Tiles. The exceptions are when playing as [Chinese%20%28Civ6%29](Chinese) or in the [Vanilla](Vanilla) ruleset, in which cases you could gain up to 3*930*0.5=1395 science from Emilie Du Chatelet.
