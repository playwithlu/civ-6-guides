# Mandate of Heaven (Civ5)

Mandate of Heaven is a [Social%20policies%20%28Civ5%29](social policy) in "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)". It is part of the [Piety%20%28Civ5%29](Piety) tree.
When God has ordained that your ruler occupies the place of an intermediary between Heaven and the world, all people must rejoice and obey. Their faith becomes stronger, and allows that ruler to channel it much more efficiently to the empire's benefit.
Strategy.
This is a stand-alone level 1 Policy (similar to [Aristocracy%20%28Civ5%29](Aristocracy)), and you may adopt it whenever you want. The {{Faith5}} discount is great for the initial stages of spreading your Religion, and it becomes especially useful when and if you have a Belief for buying a special religious building ([Cathedral%20%28Civ5%29](Cathedral) or the like); otherwise the benefit is limited to purchasing [Missionary%20%28Civ5%29](Missionaries), and maybe [Inquisitor%20%28Civ5%29](Inquisitors), if your empire suffers from a bad form of foreign religious infiltration. Still, remember that you "do" need to produce {{Faith5}} - this Policy only reduces, but does not eliminate the cost.
It is important to note that the cost of spawning or purchasing [Great%20Prophet%20%28Civ5%29](Great Prophets) does NOT benefit from this Policy! Their minimum {{Faith5}} requirements remain the same. This is also valid for all other [Great%20People%20%28Civ5%29](Great People) that can be purchased later in the game.
