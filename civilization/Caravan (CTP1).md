Summary.
The sole purpose of the Caravan, a collection of freight vehicles, is to conduct trade by transporting [Goods%20%28CTP1%29](goods) along [Trade%20route%20%28CTP1%29](trade routes). Caravans never require orders and never appear on the [Map%20%28CTP1%29](map). Caravans do not have to be built in the [City%20%28CTP1%29](city) operating the trade route. One Caravan can support one trade route, while one city can support four incoming and four outgoing trade routes.
Great Library entry.
Trade has always depended on three things: supply, demand, and transportation. The Caravan provided the essential transportation. By Roman times Caravans loaded with wool, gold, and silver traveled to China and returned with silk. Centuries later, the Clipper Ship and other sailing craft replaced the Caravan.
