# Supply Convoy (Civ6)

The Supply Convoy is a [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Support](support unit) in "". It upgrades from the [Medic%20%28Civ6%29](Medic) after researching [Combustion%20%28Civ6%29](Combustion) and [Sanitation%20%28Civ6%29](Sanitation).
Strategy.
In contrast to the Medic, the Supply Convoy is faster and can be used for both offensive and defensive purposes. Put it in the middle of a friendly force, and they'll all receive a bonus at the start of their turn, allowing them to push deeper into enemy [Territory%20%28Civ6%29](territory). Once they get into the thick of the action, have the Supply Convoy hang back and move damaged units next to it so they can heal up and be ready to rejoin the battle sooner. Supply Convoys are particularly effective when linked to [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Siege](siege units) (which they will enable to attack after moving even without the [Expert%20Crew%20%28Civ6%29](Expert Crew) ) and [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Light%20cavalry](light cavalry units) with the [Escort%20Mobility%20%28Civ6%29](Escort Mobility) (which will allow them to move efficiently and safely at the same time while also providing a constant speed boost to the cavalry unit).
Notably, the Supply Convoy also increases the healing rate of based [Air%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](air units) and allows adjacent [Naval%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](naval units) to heal outside of friendly territory.
