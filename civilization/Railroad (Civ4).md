# Railroad (Civ4)

Strategy.
Railroad allows construction of [Machine%20Gun%20%28Civ4%29](Machine Gun) units and the [Mining%20Inc](Mining Inc) wonder. Most importantly, with [Coal%20%28Civ4%29](Coal) or [Oil%20%28Civ4%29](Oil) it allows your [Worker%20%28Civ4%29](Workers) to upgrade your [Roads%20and%20railroads%20%28Civ4%29](roads) to [Roads%20and%20railroads%20%28Civ4%29](railroads), vastly increasing your units' movement.
