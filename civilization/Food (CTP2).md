# Food (CTP2)

Gameplay.
Food is one of the fundamental resources of the game. All {{LinkCTP2|Cities}} grow and harvest Food by working the tiles of land in and around the city. The city limits (represented by a white dotted line drawn on the map) indicate from which tiles a city draws Food. Different terrain types grow varying levels of Food, and {{LinkCTP2|Farm}} {{LinkCTP2|Tile Improvements}} can help a city increase their Food production. 
If a city produces more Food than it consumes, it will store it. If a city begins consuming more than it can produce, it will draw from any available food stores. If it depletes its stores, the city will starve and people will die, reducing population.
To control the distribution of Food at the empire level, the player can set the {{LinkCTP2|Rations}} level for each citizen. The higher the {{LinkCTP2|Rations}} level, the more Food is distributed and the quicker food stores are depleted. If an empire's Food production cannot support the rations level, it will be automatically decreased. {{LinkCTP2|Rations}} level has a direct impact on {{LinkCTP2|Happiness}}.
