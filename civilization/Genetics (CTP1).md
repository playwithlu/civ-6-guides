# Genetics (CTP1)

Genetics is an advance in "".
Summary.
The fourth Medical Advance, Genetics, unlocks the blueprints of life creating the possibility of engineering new organisms. To understand the full scope of this power, scientists must know the DNA sequences of every human, not just one - hence the Genome Project, which enables the tailoring of the human species to increase production and general strength. But like Pandora's Box, this knowledge goes to ill as well as good use: the Infector lurks in the shadows awaiting orders to wreak his havoc on enemy cities.
Great Library entry.
The field of Genetics dates back to the 19th century, when Mendel first established his rules of genetic inheritance. However, it was not until the mid 20th century that scientists discovered DNA through a combination of x-ray imaging and chemical detective work. By the early 1970s, the basic principles of genetics had been well established. Henceforward, pharmaceutical companies increasingly led the march into new territory, searching DNA for a hint as to origins and cures for disease. With an existing distribution system, pharmaceutical companies knew that they could market any new discoveries.
