# Stanisław Samostrzelnik (Civ6)/Civilopedia

A Polish monk who paints in the Renaissance style, Stanisław Samostrzelnik is known for his rich illuminations and colorful frescoes. His 'Portrait of Bishop Piotr Tomicki' is a brilliant contrast of gold and green.
Not bad for someone who is colorblind.
