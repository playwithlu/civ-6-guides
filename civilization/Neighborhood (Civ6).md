Strategy.
The Neighborhood epitomizes the [Modern%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Modern Era's) tendency of people to abandon the rural lifestyle and move into [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities). It provides the means to increase the Population of big cities even more in the late game, when you've already exhausted all other possibilities for . However, not a lot of people enjoy living next to ugly [Mine%20%28Civ6%29](Mines), loud [Aerodrome%20%28Civ6%29](Aerodromes), and parasite-infested [Rainforest%20%28Civ6%29](Rainforests) (excepting the [Brazilian%20%28Civ6%29](Brazilians)). Thus, more people will be able to live in your Neighborhoods when you place them near attractive [Coast%20%28Civ6%29](Coasts), [Water%20Park%20%28Civ6%29](Water Parks), and [Natural%20wonder%20%28Civ6%29](natural wonders).
A common strategy is to replace [Farm%20%28Civ6%29](Farms) with Neighborhoods. Farms usually aren't needed much in the late game as you gain other means of feeding your Population, and as your cities' [Borders%20%28Civ6%29](borders) expand and give access to more [Resource%20%28Civ6%29](resources). Note, however, that a tile with a Neighborhood doesn't produce anything but , since it can't be worked at all. If you plan to replace a lot of Farms with Neighborhoods, you can run [Public%20Transport%20%28Civ6%29](Public Transport) to amass a lot of for your effort.
Additionally, Neighborhoods are directly vulnerable to enemy [Spy%20%28Civ6%29](Spies) via the [Espionage%20%28Civ6%29%23Espionage%20Missions](Recruit Partisans) espionage mission. If carried out successfully, this will cause 2-4 [Barbarian%20%28Civ6%29](rebel) [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ6/By%20class%23Anti-cavalry](anti-cavalry units) to spawn around the district. Their level will match the current [Era%20%28Civ6%29](World Era).
