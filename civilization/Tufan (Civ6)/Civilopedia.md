# Tufan (Civ6)/Civilopedia

After the Uyghur took Tufan from the Tibetans in 803, they would maintain they entwine it with their national identity, making the religion the faith of the state. For a time.
Buddhism would still hold sway, thanks to the nearby influence of China as well as Tufan's location along the path of the Silk Road, but it was the presence of Muslims among their Mongol neighbors who would help dramatically change the religious identity of the Uyghurs and Tufan.
By the Tenth Century conquerors like Sultan Boghra Khan (or Satuq Bughra Khan Gazi) of Kashgar would be eying Tufan, and he would wage a one year war of conversion in the direction neighboring Khitay.
By the time of the Yuan Dynasty (between the 1260-1368), the conversion would be complete; members of the Muslim community were (relatively) integrated throughout the region in peace, even serving in the Chinese court.
