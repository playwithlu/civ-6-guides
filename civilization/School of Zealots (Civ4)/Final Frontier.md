Civilopedia entry.
The first Schools of Zealots were brutal training camps where students were nearly as likely to suffocate in a zero gravity combat exercise as they were to graduate. More recent incarnations have replaced the sheer brutality of earlier Schools with rigorous discipline, which has allowed these institutions to create prestigious soldiers at greatly reduced casualty rates.
