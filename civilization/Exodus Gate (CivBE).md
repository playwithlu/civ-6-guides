The Exodus Gate requires and Purity level 13.
"Used to bring Earthling Settlers through a warp gate from Earth. Leads to the Promised land ."
To build this Wonder, select "Exodus Gate" from the city Wonders build list. It can be built on an owned tile within 5 distance of the city. Select a suitable hex and answer the confirmation prompt.
To use this building, simply select it and use the Summon Earthling Settler ability. Twenty Earthling Settlers must be settled for a victory.
[Earthling%20Settler%20%28CivBE%29](Earthling Settlers) use the same placement rules as settlements. Up to 6 settlers can be settled in a single settlement, meaning that at least 4 settlements are necessary to win the Promised Land victory.
The Exodus Gate can be attacked and destroyed to prevent victory. It has 300 health, 0 defense and can be garrisoned like a city (providing 20% of unit melee strength as defense). To be destroyed at least 3 attacks are required, with the last one being melee. If it is destroyed, the Gate must be reconstructed if more Earthling Settlers are needed. Settlements can be destroyed by pillaging the tile. It is possible to lose the Gate and win the game if enough Earthling Settlers were summoned.
