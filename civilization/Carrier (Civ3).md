# Carrier (Civ3)

Aircraft Carriers are [Naval%20unit%20%28Civ3%29](naval units) that can carry [Air%20unit%20%28Civ3%29](air units) and are legitimate airbases. Air units may re-base to carriers, and can launch missions from them. Carriers are equipped with Radar, so they can see two squares in all directions, regardless of any blocking terrain.
A coastal city needs [Oil%20%28Civ3%29](oil) in its Strategic Resource box to build a carrier.
