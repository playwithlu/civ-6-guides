# Oil Power Plant (Civ6)

The Oil Power Plant is an advanced [Production%20%28Civ6%29](production) [Building%20%28Civ6%29](building) in "". It is the second power-producing building in the game; it is built in the [Industrial%20Zone%20%28Civ6%29](Industrial Zone) [District%20%28Civ6%29](district) and requires a [Factory%20%28Civ6%29](Factory) (or one of its replacements).
Strategy.
The Oil Power Plant converts {{Oil6}} into {{Power6}} just as efficiently as its predecessor processes {{Coal6}}, but emits less CO2 and therefore makes less of a contribution to [Climate%20%28Civ6%29](climate change). If you have access to {{Oil6}} and are concerned about your [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilization's) carbon footprint, upgrade your [Coal%20Power%20Plant%20%28Civ6%29](Coal Power Plants) as soon as possible after researching [Electricity%20%28Civ6%29](Electricity).
However, you have to keep in mind that almost all land and [Naval%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](naval units) in the [Atomic%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Atomic) and [Information%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Information Era) consume {{Oil6}}. This means that they will draw from the same stockpile as the Oil Power Plant and you may run into problems trying to maintain enough supply to serve both ends.
