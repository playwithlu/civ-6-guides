Game info.
Gravships, the juggernauts of the distant future, provide all the advantages of aircraft with none of the range limitations. Gravships can move swiftly over land and sea, and need never return to friendly bases for refueling.
Gravships are a unit able to fly without ever having to refuel. Units made with the gravship chassis have the same movement points as needlejets. They can only attack once per turn, like the needlejet. Unlike the needlejet and copters, they can capture bases.
Gravship colony pods cannot build bases on water, only land.
