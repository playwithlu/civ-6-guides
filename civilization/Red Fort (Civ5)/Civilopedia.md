# Red Fort (Civ5)/Civilopedia

Built by Shah Jahan, the Lal Qil'ah in Delhi, better known as the Red Fort, was the residence and administrative palace for the Mughal emperors from 1648 AD, when construction was completed, until 1857, when the last Mughal emperor was exiled by the British government. So-called for the red sandstone used to construct its massive 75-foot high outer walls, the Red Fort is a tribute to the magnificence of Mughal architecture with large audience halls, luxurious living quarters, richly landscaped gardens, baths, libraries, and sumptuous mosques. With British occupation the Red Fort was stripped of its valuables, a number of buildings inside it were demolished, the gardens largely filled in, and it was used as a military cantonment. In 2003, the Indian government began a long-term project to restore the Red Fort to its former opulence as a tourist site.
