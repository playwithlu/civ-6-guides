Militia Rush.

"1. What is militia rush?
You start the game with a [Settlers%20%28CivRev%29](Settler). Move this settler to a location
directly next to a [Barbarian%20%28CivRev%29](barbarian) village. Build your first [City%20%28CivRev%29](city) there.
Your [Advisor%20%28CivRev%29%23Military%20Advisor](military adviser) will appear asking you if you want to make a [Militia%20%28CivRev%29](Militia).
Move the militia unit out of the village. Your military adviser will appear 
again, telling you that a militia has formed. Move the 2nd unit.
I usually make about 70 units. I use them for total area control of the
[Map%20%28CivRev%29](map). They cannot attack, but they can defend.
Be sure to declare war on the first 2 or 3 civilizations you encounter. 
Because if you have peace they can teleport all your units out of their
area.
2. What do you mean 'strategy report'?
I beat the game on 'Deity' using militia rush. [Delhi](Delhi) was very close to me.
I completely surrounded his only [Warrior%20%28CivRev%29](warrior) with militia so it couldn't move.
I also surrounded Delhi, thus cutting off their production. My militia were 
spreading across the map and had discovered a river or something.
I used the [Gold%20%28currency%29%20%28CivRev%29](gold) to build warriors more quickly. I was able to attack Delhi
with a warrior before they could build a second unit.
Next were the [Mongolian%20%28CivRev%29](Mongols). I was able to isolate their warrior as well.
I also completely surrounded their city. but they had time to make 
defensive units. So, I had to make a [Catapult%20%28CivRev%29](catapult) [Army%20%28CivRev%29](army). Then I took out
the Mongols. Also, I isolated all the barbarian villages so that the
two remaining enemies could not get them before I did.
I sent out [Galleon%20%28CivRev%29](galleons) to get all the [Artifacts%20%28CivRev%29](artifacts). It took a few hours to
build [Tank%20%28CivRev%29](tanks) and take out the other two enemies. That's all."
Note that the above strategy works in single player only. They must have fixed it for online.
Quick Rush.

"First make a city near a [Mountain%20%28CivRev%29](mountain), [Hill%20%28CivRev%29](hill) or [Forest%20%28CivRev%29](forest). Then make a second city that has lots of gold production, e.g. near water or [Gems%20%28CivRev%29](gems). Use the first city to build units and the second to make gold. This will help you be able to rush more units and expand."
