# Stable (Civ4)/Civilopedia

A stable is any building in which horses are kept; a military stable would also include training grounds, barracks for the troopers, blacksmiths, armories, and the like. A horse must be extensively trained if it is to be successfully used in battle. In their natural state, most horses quite sensibly seek to run away from dangerous situations - say, when surrounded by screaming men armed with sharp objects. A cavalrymen's horse, on the other hand, needs to be able to suppress this instinct and instead instantly carry out any order given it by its rider - no matter how suicidal. Such training takes time and skill - for both mount and rider. Stables provide such training: any civilization which plans to employ large numbers of horsemen would be well-advised to make the investment and build as many stables as possible.
