# Wheel (Civ6)

Wheel is an [Ancient%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Ancient Era) [Technology%20%28Civ6%29](technology) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)". It can be hurried by building a [Mine%20%28Civ6%29](Mine) on a [Resource%20%28Civ6%29](resource).
Strategy.
There is history before the wheel and then there is history after the wheel. It is indeed difficult to describe how important this technological invention is for human history, but suffice it to say that the wheel makes possible the entire concept of a machine, which is personified in the earliest battle machine: the [Heavy%20Chariot%20%28Civ6%29](Heavy Chariot).
Along with Heavy Chariots (which are the strongest melee units in the Ancient Era), Wheel unlocks the [Water%20Mill%20%28Civ6%29](Water Mill), which can range from being immensely helpful to not accessible at all! This should help you decide exactly when to research this tech: if your starting location is on a [River%20%28Civ6%29](River), close to , and/or , and you don't have other considerations (such as founding a [Religion%20%28Civ6%29](religion), or having to go for [Irrigation%20%28Civ6%29](Irrigation) due the specific type of Luxuries nearby) you may go for it right after [Mining%20%28Civ6%29](Mining). In other cases, especially if your first [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) is not on a River, you won't have immediate use for Wheel and should research more useful techs such as [Bronze%20Working%20%28Civ6%29](Bronze Working) and [Sailing%20%28Civ6%29](Sailing) first.
The activates only if you build the [Mine%20%28Civ6%29](Mine) on a resource! A Mine built on a [Hills%20%28Civ6%29](Hill) without anything won't do.
