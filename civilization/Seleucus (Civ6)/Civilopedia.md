# Seleucus (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Seleucus was a contemporary of Alexander who trained with the best and brightest Philip II’s Macedon. He commanded the elite hypaspistai during Alexander’s campaigns, and his responsibility for protecting Alexander’s flanks continued long after his death, when Seleucus ultimately founded the Seleucid Empire, which stretched from modern day Turkey to Afghanistan.
