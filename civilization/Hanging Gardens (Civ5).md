# Hanging Gardens (Civ5)

Game Info.
Requires [Tradition%20%28Civ5%29](Tradition). ({{BNW}})
Strategy.
The Hanging Gardens - or the Tradition Wonder, as we might dub it in "" - greatly helps the {{Population5}} growth in this [City%20%28Civ5%29](city). This is very valuable in the early game, when {{Population5}} growth is your main means of progress. Keep in mind that it's somewhat competitive, and may not be attainable on Emperor and higher [Difficulty%20level%20%28Civ5%29](difficulties). Furthermore, the free [Garden%20%28Civ5%29](Garden) ignores [Terrain%20%28Civ5%29](terrain) requirements and can grant the [Great%20People%20%28Civ5%29](Great Person) generation bonus to a large city that could not have had it otherwise.
