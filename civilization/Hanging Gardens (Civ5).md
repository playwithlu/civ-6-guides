# Hanging Gardens (Civ5)

Game Info.
Requires [Tradition%20%28Civ5%29](Tradition). ()
Strategy.
The Hanging Gardens - or the Tradition Wonder, as we might dub it in "" - greatly helps the growth in this [City%20%28Civ5%29](city). This is very valuable in the early game, when growth is your main means of progress. Keep in mind that it's somewhat competitive, and may not be attainable on Emperor and higher [Difficulty%20level%20%28Civ5%29](difficulties). Furthermore, the free [Garden%20%28Civ5%29](Garden) ignores [Terrain%20%28Civ5%29](terrain) requirements and can grant the [Great%20People%20%28Civ5%29](Great Person) generation bonus to a large city that could not have had it otherwise.
