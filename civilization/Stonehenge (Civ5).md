# Stonehenge (Civ5)

Strategy.
One of the earliest Wonders available, Stonehenge will jump-start your [Religion%20%28Civ5%29](religion). In a time when you're producing 1-2 per turn, the wonder's bonus will boost this stat significantly, typically allowing you to found a religion within 20-30 turns of building it. Also, the [Great%20Engineer%20%28Civ5%29](Great Engineer) point is very welcome at this earliest phase of the game. 
Stonehenge also allows a player to potentially get a religion without choosing a -generating pantheon or having access to a -generating [Natural%20wonder%20%28Civ5%29](Natural Wonder). 
Beware of risking this wonder on higher [Difficulty%20level%20%28Civ5%29](difficulties) (Emperor and above), as it's high on the priority list of the [AI](AI).
