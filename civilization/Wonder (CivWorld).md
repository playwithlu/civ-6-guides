# Wonder (CivWorld)

A Wonder is a monumental building or event in world history that is constructed with [Great%20Person%20%28CivWorld%29](Great People). There are two kinds of Wonders in "[CivWorld](CivWorld)": [%23List%20of%20Great%20Wonders](Great Wonders), which provide powerful and persistent bonuses to all members of the [Civilizations%20%28CivWorld%29](Civilization) that builds them; and [%23List%20of%20Wonder%20Events](Wonder Events), which provide a one-time bonus to a Civilization. Building Wonders is the key to winning [Era%20%28CivWorld%29](Eras) through Culture. Early Eras may require as few as three Wonders for victory, whereas later Eras may require up to 21.
Much of the information on this page comes from IGN's "CivWorld" Guide.
Building a Wonder.
Wonders are built by combining Great People of a specific type. Once all of a Wonder's Great Person slots are filled, the Civilization builds it immediately. Players cannot usually contribute more than one Great Person to each Wonder, but a Civilization's Culture Minister and members of a Civilization with [The%20United%20Nations%20%28CivWorld%29](The United Nations) or [Freedom%20of%20Speech%20%28CivWorld%29](Freedom of Speech) can contribute any number of Great People to a single Wonder.
Replacing Wonders.
Another Civilization may replace a Wonder that has already been constructed by contributing at least one more Great Person (and sometimes up to six more) than the previous owner used to build it. Civilizations cannot replace their own Wonders.
Obsolete Wonders.
Early Wonders become [obsolete](obsolete) as advanced technology is discovered. Obsolete Wonders cannot be replaced, so they will remain under their last owner's control unless that Civilization is conquered.
Wonder Events.
Wonder Events, much like Great Wonders, require Great People to build and affect an entire Civilization. There are, however, three key differences between them:
