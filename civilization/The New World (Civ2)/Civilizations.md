They share access to a common unit roster and technology tree, with relative difficulty determined by starting geography and proximity to rival civs. The [%23Africans](Africans) are a special civilization not intended for human play that features an advanced start.
The scenario disables s but allows , and includes full definitions for [%23Reserve%20civs](replacement tribes) if any of the seven starting civs are conquered.
 White (replacing s)
Chinook.
&lt;br&gt;: 
&lt;br&gt;: Rational
The begin in the northwest corner of the , at the . They start the farthest from any other civ, separated from their nearest neighbor the Anasazi by 30 s, although several systems can facilitate long-distance travel. Their immediate location is shielded by the , with the to the south-southeast offering for , and the providing a natural eastern border. The Chinook begin with ready access to the , providing an alternative expansion vector via the West Coast once s become available.
Iroquois.
Color: Green (replacing s)
&lt;br&gt;Leader: 
&lt;br&gt;Personality: Civilized
The Iroquois begin in the northeastern continent, in the upper . Their starting situation is potentially the most challenging: most of their immediate terrain is and , making city difficult without . They begin in extremely close proximity (seven tiles northeast) to the Adena, who can potentially block westward and southward expansion.
Conversely, the Iroquois can accrue high from the to the west and the rivers of eastern Canada to the north. They also start close to the , and are the nearest physical start to the African .
Adena.
Color: Blue (replacing s)
&lt;br&gt;Leader: 
&lt;br&gt;Personality: Rational, Civilized
The begin in extremely close proximity (seven tiles southwest) to the Iroquois, in similar terrain at the border of the and the . However, they have better opportunities to settle arable land in the south and west, and start with ready access to the , expediting travel through the continental interior.
Anasazi.
Color: Yellow (replacing s)
&lt;br&gt;Leader: Chaco
&lt;br&gt;Personality: Rational, Perfectionist
The present the most versatile start: their location at the top of the provides a mix of hills and farmable , with rivers facilitating access to the and . They are close enough to the Aztecs to be viable without them posing an imminent military threat.
Maya.
Color: Teal (replacing s)
&lt;br&gt;Leader: 
&lt;br&gt;Personality: Aggressive, Militaristic
The Maya have a somewhat challenging start. They begin on the northern coast of the amid dense ; westward expansion will contend with the Aztecs, but the Maya in turn can secure exclusive access to the eastern frontier, with the offering several sites for [canal](canal) cities to link the Pacific Ocean and . Mayan ships can also safely reach the western edge of [Cuban](Cuba), and from there, the and coast. Depending on the [AI](AI)'s behavior, the Maya are the first potential point of contact for the Africans.
Aztecs.
Color: Orange (replacing s)
&lt;br&gt;Leader: [Montezuma](Montezuma)
&lt;br&gt;Personality: Aggressive, Militaristic
The Aztecs begin in central [Mexican](Mexico) at the . They offer the most balanced start, with the Anasazi and Maya providing early potential trading partners. The Maya are a probable obstacle to southeastern expansion, but the north and west have ample opportunities for settlement before contending with the Anasazi.
Africans.
Color: Purple (replacing s)
&lt;br&gt;Leader: [Hamilcar%20Barca](Hamilcar)
&lt;br&gt;Personality: Rational, Civilized, Perfectionist
The Africans are a special civilization not intended for human play. They begin with a single, one- city, "Old Country", on a one-tile island at the northeastern map edge garrisoned with a Soldiers unit, a Longboat in the northeastern Caribbean Sea, and most [Ancient%20World%20%28Civ2%29](Ancient Era) advances already .
&lt;br&gt;
The Africans' limited starting production capacity puts them at a comparative disadvantage to the other civs in terms of territorial expansion, unless they bolster their forces through . They appear intended to serve as trading partners and for the Native Americans, with their advanced technology allowing other civs to leapfrog the advances tree.
There is a 1-in-100 chance each that the Africans will unilaterally abandon the Americas (civilization is destroyed through a ), announced by a global popup message. It is therefore possible for a game to progress without the Africans having any tangible effect.
Reserve civs.
In addition to the scenario's starting civs, the and files contain complete code for all potential players. While the scenario disables s, it does not prohibit , meaning defeated civs can be succeeded by another tribe in their color group.
