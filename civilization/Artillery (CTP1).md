Explosives brought about a new age in warfare with smokeless powder and TNT. From this, new artillery developed armed with explosive shells and capable of firing over much longer ranges. The effect of these developments can be seen in casualty rates. During the Russo-Japanese War of 1905, only ten percent of casualties were attributed to artillery. By World War I as many as seventy percent of casualties were attributed to artillery fire. Despite this, the inability of artillery to destroy defensive positions or to target enemy batteries meant that initially, the new artillery was not flawless.
