The Cree are incredibly powerful in the early game, while their talents in trade propel their early advantages into the future.
Intro.
 Poundmaker, you bear the fate of the Cree without complaint. None doubt the skill of your warriors, but they rely upon your wisdom—striking your enemies does no good if you cannot protect your homes. As the world changes in unexpected ways, your alliances will bind you to a lasting future. Those who stand alone die alone.
In-Game.
Poundmaker's unique [Agenda%20%28Civ6%29](agenda) is Iron Confederacy. He tries to establish as many alliances as possible, and dislikes civilizations that don't establish alliances.
His [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader ability) is Favorable Terms. It allows all types of alliances to provide Shared Visibility, and rewards him with extra and for receiving and sending s depending on the number of [Camp%20%28Civ6%29](Camps) and [Pasture%20%28Civ6%29](Pastures) at the destination.
Detailed Approach.
Choosing which military unit to train first isn't a difficult choice for the Cree. The [Okihtcitaw%20%28Civ6%29](Okihtcitaw) starts the game with a free , giving them an exploration advantage over all other civilizations. Combined with a stronger combat strength, it's almost unnecessary to build [Warrior%20%28Civ6%29](Warriors) to protect your first cities. Quickly researching the [Pottery%20%28Civ6%29](Pottery) [Technologies%20%28Civ6%29](technology) is also an obvious choice for the Cree, gaining an early trade route to send to a foreign city you've inevitably found with your unique reconnaissance units, and grabbing territory along the way. Poundmaker is a superior trader and negotiator; making favorable trades to cities with Camps and Pastures only increases his proceeds. Using friendly alliances to gain visibility in the world is extremely valuable in the mid and late game, when you need to see what your opponents are up to.
