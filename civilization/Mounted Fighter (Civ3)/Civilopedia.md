# Mounted Fighter (Civ3)/Civilopedia

The barbarian Mounted Fighter is the barbarians' mounted combat unit. Skill-wise, it is on par with the
horseman. Since the emphasis is on building wondrous monuments in this scenario,
the various barbarian units have been given no build cost to prevent the player from accruing large
amounts of victory points by concentrating on killing barbarians.
