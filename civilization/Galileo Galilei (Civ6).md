Strategy.
Prior to "", the maximum possible from Galileo Galilei in most circumstances is 1250. However, with the addition of the [Mountain%20Tunnel%20%28Civ6%29](Mountain Tunnel), it is possible to obtain 1500 .
Another Renaissance Era Great Scientist, [Emilie%20Du%20Chatelet%20%28Civ6%29](Emilie Du Chatelet), provides three s from the Renaissance or [Industrial%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Industrial Era). The three most expensive Industrial Era [Technology%20%28Civ6%29](technologies) are 930 each, so Emilie provides at most 1116 (3 * 930 * 0.4) . Therefore, Galileo Galilei is always a better choice if he can be activated with 5 adjacent Mountain tiles. The exceptions are when playing as the [Chinese%20%28Civ6%29](Chinese) or the [Babylonian%20%28Civ6%29](Babylonians) and under the [vanilla](vanilla) ruleset, in which cases you can gain at least 1395 (3 * 930 * 0.5) from Emilie Du Chatelet.
