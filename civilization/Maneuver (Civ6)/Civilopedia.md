# Maneuver (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Once warfare moved past the stage of small masses of men just having at it in a club-thumping melee, maneuvers gave the more nimble warriors a distinct advantage in battle. The concept of using rapid movements to keep the enemy at a disadvantage is almost as old as the idea of war itself. Tactical maneuvers are intended to be used on the battlefield, while “maneuver warfare” covers all that leads up to forcing an enemy to fight at a place or time they’d rather not. Both types came to prominence with the advent of chariots and cavalry … and their importance hasn’t diminished since.
