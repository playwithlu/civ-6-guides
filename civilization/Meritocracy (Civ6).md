# Meritocracy (Civ6)

Meritocracy is an Economic [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](Policy Card) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
In ' and ', Meritocracy is removed from the game.
Strategy.
Meritocracy is a way to increase not only general output, but also [Borders%20%28Civ6%29](border) growth rate in the affected [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities). Note that the effect applies to s that the city has already constructed, so it should probably read "for each specialty district it controls."
Of course, the more cities with districts you have, the better. Meritocracy may actually be more beneficial to a huge empire that has numerous cities with 1-2 districts than a small empire with 4-5 districts in each city. However, note that the policy will be completely useless for newly-established cities.
