# Al-Hakam II (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Second Umayyad caliph of al-Andalus, son of the great Abd al-Rahman III, born in November 915 AD in the great city of Cordoba, died in that same great city in October 976, his great reign represented the greatest period in the caliphate; under his personal patronage, Moorish arts and science reached a golden age in al-Andalus.
Al-Hakam II sought to improve his people’s lot, despite the Christians battering at the door. Already a rich kingdom, al-Hakam sponsored irrigation projects to boost agricultural output, widened streets in his towns, and ordered the building of more markets. He assembled a great personal library for use by scholars invited from across both Muslim and Christian lands, supposedly as large as 600 thousand books (more than one historian disputes this, many pegging the figure at a only 400 thousand). Construction projects included the expansion of the mosque in Cordoba and the completion of the royal residence Medina Azahara.
But it wasn’t all peaceful; early in his reign al-Hakam waged a successful war against the invading Christian kings of Navarre and of Castile and León. His naval forces defeated sea raiders and Norman pirates. And in 973 his forces took Tangier from the last Idrisids, thereby annexing Morocco just before al-Hakam’s death.
