# Embrasure (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Technically speaking, an embrasure is a gap or opening in a fortification to allow ranged weapons to strike, while protecting their wielders. It can apply more generally to the placement of ranged fire zones as part of a system of defenses, often skillfully overlapping, making things very dangerous for attackers.
