Game Info.

Strategy.
Snow tiles are, far and away, the most useless terrain in the game. They are generally not useful for anything except [Great%20People%20%28Civ5%29](Great Person) [List%20of%20improvements%20in%20Civ5](improvements) and [Fort%20%28Civ5%29](Forts), unless there happens to be a [Resources%20%28Civ5%29](resource) on them. [Hill%20%28Civ5%29](Hills) in Snow provide no base yield, but can be improved with [Mine%20%28Civ5%29](Mines) for some ; [Farm%20%28Civ5%29](Farms) can also be built on Snow tiles that have access to [Fresh%20water%20%28Civ5%29](fresh water), such as that provided by a [Lakes%20%28Civ5%29](Lake). Avoid settling on Snow whenever possible, and if you have to in order to access some resource, try to settle on the shore so you can use [Coast%20%28Civ5%29](Coast) tiles and their resources.
