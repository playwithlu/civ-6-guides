During World War II, the anti-aircraft and flak cannon were the chief means of defending against air attacks. Developments in rocketry led to the invention of the surface-to-air missile (SAM), changing air combat forever. Flying several times the speed of sound, SAMs employed heat-sensitive tracking systems and radar guidance to reach all but the highest flying spy planes. Even the swiftest planes found SAMs a threat, and planes were soon equipped with chaff and flares to attempt to fool the missile's tracking systems into following alternate objects or heat sources. SAMs mounted on a vehicle increased operation range.
