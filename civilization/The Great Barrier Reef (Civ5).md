# The Great Barrier Reef (Civ5)

The Great Barrier Reef is a [Natural%20wonder%20%28Civ5%29](natural wonder) in "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)". It spawns in [Coast%20%28Civ5%29](Coast) tiles.
Strategy.
Unlike other natural wonders, the Great Barrier Reef covers two [hex](hex)es that are adjacent to each other. These tiles cannot be entered by [Naval%20units%20%28Civ5%29](naval) or [Embarkation%20%28Civ5%29](embarked) [Unit%20%28Civ5%29](units). As the tiles are adjacent, a [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilization) easily gets the discovery bonus twice, which can be an incredible boost for the [Spanish%20%28Civ5%29](Spanish). Also, each of the tiles can be worked separately, and each provides the stated bonuses, effectively doubling the wonder's output.
While coastal [Resources%20%28Civ5%29](resources) like may be found on Great Barrier Reef tiles, giving their resource bonus, [Fishing%20Boats%20%28Civ5%29](Fishing Boats) cannot work the tiles.
