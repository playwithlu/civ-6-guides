# Creative Constructions (Civ4)/Civilopedia

The Great Pyramids, the Hagia Sophia and the Hoover Dam all started their famed existences in the same way - with a pile of stones and an ambitious engineer. In the past, grand projects were taken on by princes or heads of state, but today these works are built by corporations. Often employing both an architect and a construction team, modern construction companies both dream up and execute the shaping of a piece of land into a new edifice. Beyond simply erecting the building, it often falls upon the construction company to reign in the wild designs of upstart architects like Frank Lloyd Wright and Antoni Gaudi to ensure the completion of their works. Perhaps if a construction executive had been present during the designing of Gaudi's Sagrada Familia, it would already be complete and accepting donations for renovations.
