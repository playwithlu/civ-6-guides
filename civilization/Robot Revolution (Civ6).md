# Robot Revolution (Civ6)

 is the third [Challenge%20of%20the%20month%20%28Civ6%29](challenge of the month) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)", running from January 9 to February 13, 2024.
Description.
Do you have what it takes to ensure your civilization's survival for 100 turns in a frozen, post-nuclear future? From now until February 13, you've got the chance to prove it. Oh, and did we mention the robots?
Resources are sparse, disasters are intense, and Giant Death Robots are a constant threat. Your memory of life before the robot takeover is fading, but parts of the world are still known to you. As the Prime Minister of Canada, Wilfrid Laurier, will you scour the frozen wasteland for resources and remnants of the old world, or hunker down and hope to outlast your opponents?
Intro.
Do you have what it takes to ensure your civilization's survival for 100 turns in a frozen, post-nuclear future? Resources are sparse, disasters are intense, and the land itself seems determined to snuff out the last traces of humanity. Oh, and did we mention the robots?
Your memory of life before the robot takeover is fading, but parts of the world are still known to you. As the Prime Minister of Canada, will you scour the frozen wasteland for resources and remnants of the old world, or hunker down in your only remaining city and hope to outlast your opponents?
Strategy.
The only type of [Victory%20%28Civ6%29](victory) you can win in this challenge is a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Score/Time](Score Victory). This means that you must not only survive for 100 [turn](turn)s, but also have the highest score when time runs out. There are no [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-states) and your opponents are far from your starting position, so [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](policy cards) or [Government%20%28Civ6%29](governments) that give bonuses to s or s are useless here. Instead, you should use your starting Governor Titles to appoint [Victor%20%28Castellan%29%20%28Civ6%29](Victor), [Magnus%20%28Steward%29%20%28Civ6%29](Magnus), and [Liang%20%28Surveyor%29%20%28Civ6%29](Liang) and get [Embrasure%20%28Civ6%29](Embrasure), [Provision%20%28Civ6%29](Provision), and [Reinforced%20Materials%20%28Civ6%29](Reinforced Materials) for them. You should also build a [Government%20Plaza%20%28Civ6%29](Government Plaza) with an [Ancestral%20Hall%20%28Civ6%29](Ancestral Hall) in your .
After building your Ancestral Hall, assign Magnus to your and train at least two [Settler%20%28Civ6%29](Settlers) and a [Machine%20Gun%20%28Civ6%29](Machine Gun). Use your starting [AT%20Crew%20%28Civ6%29](AT Crew) to find and distract any nearby [Barbarian%20%28Civ6%29](Barbarian) Giant Death Robots while your Settlers get into position to found [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) - the Barbarian GDRs can make quick work of your [Military%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](military units), but they won't actually capture your cities. Keep each new city close to (i.e., 4-5 [hex](hex)es away from) your older ones, and build [Encampment%20%28Civ6%29](Encampments) in frontier cities to protect them from roving Barbarians. The free [Builder%20%28Civ6%29](Builders) from the Ancestral Hall will help you develop each city and improve nearby [Resource%20%28Civ6%29](resources) quickly, allowing your score to increase in tandem with your empire's Population. If you need a little extra military might, consider building the [Grand%20Master%27s%20Chapel%20%28Civ6%29](Grand Master's Chapel) so you can use your 2400 starting to purchase [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](units), and always vote for Outcome B of the [World%20Congress%20%28Civ6%29%23List%20of%20Regular%20Session%20Resolutions](Mercenary Companies resolution) if it comes up in the [World%20Congress%20%28Civ6%29](World Congress) - money's tight in this challenge, so getting a 50% or discount on unit purchases will be a huge help.
Once you've got at least three cities up and running, focus on improving your [Historic%20Moment%20%28Civ6%29](Era Score) by building splendid s (i.e., those with [Adjacency%20bonus%20%28Civ6%29](adjacency bonuses) of +4 or greater), [Building%20%28Civ6%29](buildings), and [Ice%20Hockey%20Rink%20%28Civ6%29](Ice Hockey Rinks) and training or purchasing a [Mountie%20%28Civ6%29](Mountie). If you manage to earn a , take Automaton Warfare as your [Age%20%28Civ6%29%23Dedications](Dedication) and use the free Giant Death Robot you get to clear the [Barbarian%20%28Civ6%29%23Outposts](Barbarian Outposts) near your [Territory%20%28Civ6%29](territory). Keep expanding and developing your cities and repairing any damage done by pillaging and [Disaster%20%28Civ6%29](disasters) (assigning Liang to your most disaster-prone city to reduce the burden on your Builders), and you'll be in good shape.
The AI [Leaders%20%28Civ6%29](leaders') scores top out around 450 on Prince [Difficulty%20level%20%28Civ6%29](difficulty), so if you pass that threshold, your victory is assured.
