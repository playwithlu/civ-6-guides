# Arabian (Civ5)

The Arabian people (sometimes Arabic people or Arabs) represent a [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilization) in "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)". They are led by .
Strategy.
The Arabians are one of the best trading nations in the game - not only because of trade routes that produce additional (in [vanilla](vanilla) and ') or their extended [Caravan%20%28Civ5%29](Caravan) range (in ') - but also because they gain access relatively early on to the [Bazaar%20%28Civ5%29](Bazaar), a terrific unique replacement for the ordinary [Market%20%28Civ5%29](Market). The Bazaar gives an additional copy of each [Luxury%20resource%20%28Civ5%29](luxury resource) worked by the [City%20%28Civ5%29](city), giving the Arabians much greater bargaining power, even in the early game. Combine this with the [Commerce%20%28Civ5%29](Commerce) policy tree to maximize land trade power.
The Arabians are also the best civilization to settle [Desert%20%28Civ5%29](deserts) (except obviously [Moroccan%20%28Civ5%29](Morocco) and situationally the [Incan%20%28Civ5%29](Inca)). Not only does the Bazaar give them additional from [Oasis%20%28Civ5%29](oasis) tiles (consider this when searching for places to found new cities), but the resource also gives them double quantity, and is usually abundant in deserts. Combine these bonuses with [Petra%20%28Civ5%29](Petra), if possible, to create a fantastic desert paradise city!
A slightly less obvious strength of the civilization is [Religion%20%28Civ5%29](religion). Their [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ5%29](unique ability) in "Brave New World" also allows trade routes to spread religious influence much faster, which means that the Arabians can easily turn their religion into an effective weapon for achieving [Victory%20%28Civ5%29](victory). Thus, by combining the two auxiliary aspects of the game ( and religion), they can aim for any type of victory!
Their [Unique%20unit%20%28Civ5%29](unique unit), the [Camel%20Archer%20%28Civ5%29](Camel Archer), is one of the better ranged units of the [Medieval%20Era%20%28Civ5%29](Medieval Era), allowing them to go on the offensive upon researching [Chivalry%20%28Civ5%29](Chivalry). Arabia can do this easily by upgrading a [Horseman%20%28Civ5%29](Horseman)/[Chariot%20Archer%20%28Civ5%29](Chariot Archer) army with Bazaar . The Camel Archer operates similarly to the [Keshik%20%28Civ5%29](Keshik), except with a higher ranged and melee strength and fewer starting [Promotions%20%28Civ5%29](promotions).
To summarize, Arabia is powerful at both [Domination%20victory%20%28Civ5%29](domination victories) and [Diplomatic%20victory%20%28Civ5%29](diplomatic ones) (via their ). It's very hard to combine the two, as a [Warmongering%20%28Civ5%29](warmongering) player will find little trade with [AI](AI) civs and thus negate their Bazaar benefits.
