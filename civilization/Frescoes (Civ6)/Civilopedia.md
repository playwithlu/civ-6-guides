# Frescoes (Civ6)/Civilopedia

The term fresco literally means "fresh" in Italian, and describes a style of painting that boomed during the Italian Renaissance. More than simply a picture painted on top of a wall, frescoes are created by applying water and color to wet plaster, allowing the pigment to absorb and dry into the plaster itself. Though perhaps the most famous fresco is the Sistine Chapel ceiling, created by Michelangelo, this technique can be found throughout history. One of the earliest examples of frescoes can be dated to c. 2000 BCE by the Minoans. Though it has fallen out of common fashion, a style similar to frescoes, known as Mexican Muralism, was rekindled in the 20th century.
