Civilopedia entry.
The sheer vastness of space makes ensuring law and order a difficult task for modern Police Agencies. Often relying on more "active" policing techniques than their predecessors, Police Agencies maintain heavy surveillance on known criminals, malcontents and ne'er-do-wells, seeking to disrupt their activities before they ever pose a threat to society. These Police Agencies for a new age promote the idea that staying quiet and unnoticed is never a bad thing. As such, War Weariness and Star System Maintenance costs are reduced with an Agency's construction, while Espionage output rises.
