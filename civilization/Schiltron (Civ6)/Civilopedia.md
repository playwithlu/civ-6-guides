# Schiltron (Civ6)/Civilopedia

During their wars of independence, the Scots devised the schiltron formation to counter the English advantages in numbers and weapons, using their 6- to 8-foot pikes to deter both infantry and cavalry, as when William Wallace drew up his schiltrons in a circle at Falkirk in 1298 AD. Schiltrons could be circular, or more commonly rectangular, the latter formations capable of both offensive as well as defensive actions, quite good at pushing back masses of English swordsmen. The first use of the schiltron offensively is credited to Robert the Bruce at Bannockburn, a glorious victory for the Scots. Thereafter, rectilinear schiltrons figured in a number of victories (and defeats as well), and the formation was adopted by the Welsh and Flemings as well.
