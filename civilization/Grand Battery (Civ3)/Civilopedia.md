# Grand Battery (Civ3)/Civilopedia

A "Grand Battery", as used by the French at Waterloo, comprised hundreds of guns,
frequently with orders to concentrate their fire on one unit or location. The shock and
disruption of a carefully planned and executed grand battery attack could turn the tide of
battle, and indeed helped Napoleon win many of his battles. The Grand
Battery is far superior to the normal cannon battery unit.
