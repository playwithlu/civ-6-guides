# Aztec (Civ4)

The Aztec people represent a [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ4](civilization) in "[Civilization%20IV](Civilization IV)".
Strategy.
The Aztecs are very effective for a [Victory%20%28Civ4%29%23Domination](Domination) or [Victory%20%28Civ4%29%23Conquest](Conquest Victory). A mixed force of [Jaguar%20%28Civ4%29](Jaguars), [Axeman%20%28Civ4%29](Axemen), [Spearman%20%28Civ4%29](Spearmen), and [Horse%20Archer%20%28Civ4%29](Horse Archers) will be deadly early in the game, as Jaguars receive a bonus when attacking [City%20%28Civ4%29](cities) and the other [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ4](units) can protect them while they do.
[Montezuma%20%28Civ4%29](Montezuma's) [Aggressive%20%28Civ4%29](Aggressive) [Leader%20trait%20%28Civ4%29](trait) gives melee units strength to swarm enemy cities, and the [Spiritual%20%28Civ4%29](Spiritual) trait allows him to switch [List%20of%20civics%20in%20Civ4](civics) without causing [Anarchy%20%28Civ4%29](Anarchy). The Aztecs' [Sacrificial%20Altar%20%28Civ4%29](Sacrificial Altar) incentivizes the use of the [Slavery%20%28Civ4%29](Slavery) civic by cutting in half the duration of anger caused by [Whipping%20%28Civ4%29](whipping).
