Sea Dragon
Game Info.
Basic alien naval unit.
Strategy.
The Sea Dragon appears noticeably more aggressive than some of the other [Aliens%20%28CivBE%29](Aliens) present in the game. It is common for them to approach and attack your naval (or embarked) units, even if you have never had any hostile encounters with the aliens.
It is advised to escort embarked units with gunboats early game, due to the aggressive nature of Sea Dragons.
