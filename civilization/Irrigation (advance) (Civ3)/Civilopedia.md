# Irrigation (advance) (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Irrigation is the artificial watering of land, usually for agriculture. The earliest use of irrigation was by
the Egyptians along the Nile River around 5000 BC. Other Mesopotamian civilizations were using irrigation by
around 2000 BC, as were the Chinese. Many different techniques of irrigation have been developed over time,
including canals and ditches and mechanical devices to bail water from waterways to higher fields.
