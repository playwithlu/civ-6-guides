# Theravada Buddhism (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Theravada, or "Way of the Elders" is a branch of Buddhism with the Pali Canon (Buddhism's oldest and most complete corpus of scripture) as its doctrinal core, and which claims descent through the very first community of Buddhist monks. It is most prevalent in Southeast Asia, where it is often the predominant form of worship.
