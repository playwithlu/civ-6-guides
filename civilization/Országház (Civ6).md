Strategy.
The Országház helps advance you toward a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Diplomacy](Diplomatic Victory) thanks to its ability to generate more based on your [Suzerain%20%28Civ6%29](Suzerainty) with [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-states). Since s are a somewhat limited resource, this wonder is especially useful for [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) and [Leaders%20%28Civ6%29](leaders) that can create s independent from the [List%20of%20civics%20in%20Civ6](civics tree) (i.e. the number of s that everyone is guaranteed to have). This includes [Hungarian%20%28Civ6%29](Hungary) (fittingly), [Georgian%20%28Civ6%29](Georgia), [Greek%20%28Civ6%29](Greece), and [American%20%28Civ6%29](America) under [Teddy%20Roosevelt%20%28Civ6%29/Rough%20Rider](Rough Rider Teddy). Run [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](policy cards) that boost generation rate in combination with [Kilwa%20Kisiwani%20%28Civ6%29](Kilwa Kisiwani), and you will be surrounded by your army of protectorates in war and generous bonuses of , , , , and in peace.

Late in the game, when all the outposts that spawned in remote areas have become city-states, its potential to help its owner generate is nothing short of astronomical.
