# Eruch (Civ5)/Civilopedia

The Eruch Empire began as a series of impassioned debates between long established noble families about the growing chaos in the world and what could be done to stop it. The debates soon reached a critical mass for action, fueled by the noblesâ€™ fear of an uncertain future as well as their desire to protect their wealth. A secret council was formed, drawing on the leadership and military prowess that had been their inheritance from previous generations. It mobilized a small but well-equipped army. With it, the nobles carved out a large territory that would become the core of Eruch, and seceded from the old kingdoms. Outwardly, leaders of Eruch profess the glories of civilized life, and seek to spread their ways to the ends of the earth. They act as gentlemen in diplomatic affairs, but always have a rigid structure of military might ready to respond at their first call.
