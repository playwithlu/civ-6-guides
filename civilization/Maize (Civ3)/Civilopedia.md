# Maize (Civ3)/Civilopedia

It's believed that around 5000 BC, the first Mesoamericans learned to grow maize (or corn) in and around the highlands of Guatemala and central Mexico. Once the practice became commonplace, maize changed the cultures of Mexico and Central America forever. 
A Mayan cornfield was called a milpa. Mayan farmers planted their maize by using a sharp stick to poke a hole into the dirt. They would then drop a few kernels into these holes, then cover them up with dirt, and on and on until several rows were planted. 
Mesoamericans built their societies on maize. For example, the Mayan creation god, Yam Kax, fashioned human beings out of corn, using cobs for arms and legs, and molding the flesh with cornmeal. These so-called "corn people‚Äù were the mythical ancestors of the Maya. 
Dried kernels of corn were also used as dice in games of chance. Black dots were painted on them and bets made to see how they would fall.
