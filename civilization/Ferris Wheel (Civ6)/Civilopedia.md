# Ferris Wheel (Civ6)/Civilopedia

Requiring the ingenuity of a bridge engineer, a pair of 1000-horsepower engines, and a little dynamite, the first Ferris Wheel would be one of the crowning achievements of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago.
Now a feature in modern fairs, carnivals, and amusement parks, the first Ferris Wheel was the brainchild of Chicago engineer George Washington Gale Ferris Jr. as an answer to the Eiffel Tower (a prominent feature of the 1889 World's Fair).
By the Twentieth Century, midways and fairs would borrow Ferris' design (along with other rides), extending these leisure activities beyond the upper classes.
