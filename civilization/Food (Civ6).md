# Food (Civ6)

Mechanics.
Each {{Citizen6}} Citizen in a city consumes 2 {{FoodIcon6}} Food per turn. If the city produces more {{FoodIcon6}} Food than its citizens currently consume, it has a {{FoodIcon6}} Food surplus, which will be stored in a "food basket." When the city's food basket fills, its {{Citizen6}} Population will increase by 1. If the city has a {{FoodIcon6}} Food deficit, its food basket depletes, and its {{Citizen6}} Population will eventually decrease by 1; in "", the city's [Loyalty%20%28Civ6%29](Loyalty) will also decrease by 4 every turn. If the situation is balanced, there will be neither growth nor decline.
Note that population growth is further affected by other factors. For more precise information, head [Population%20%28Civ6%29%23Growth%20mechanics](here).
Sources.
The main source of {{FoodIcon6}} Food is the land and its features, so the more {{Citizen6}} Citizens working fertile [Tile%20%28Civ6%29](tiles) around your cities, the better.
Terrain.
Almost all [Terrain%20%28Civ6%29](terrain) and its [Terrain%20%28Civ6%29%23Features](features) grant base {{FoodIcon6}} Food yields when worked. The full list is as follows:
Base Terrain.
The only terrains without {{FoodIcon6}} Food yield are [Desert%20%28Civ6%29](Desert) and [Snow%20%28Civ6%29](Snow), so normally you should avoid settling there.
Features.
Since all of these are available right from the start of the game and without any research, locating them and strategically placing your cities in range of them will determine how fast (or how slowly) they will grow in the early to middle game. You should scout your surroundings well!
Resources.
Many [Resource%20%28Civ6%29](resources) also contribute {{FoodIcon6}} Food when worked. These include:
Tile Improvements.
The [Farm%20%28Civ6%29](Farm) is a basic [Tile%20improvement%20%28Civ6%29](tile improvement) specifically dedicated to {{FoodIcon6}} Food production, and besides it is available from the start of the game without research. It provides +1 {{FoodIcon6}} Food initially, but researching certain [Civic%20%28Civ6%29](civics) and [Technology%20%28Civ6%29](technologies) increases its potential {{FoodIcon6}} Food yield.
Other improvements also grant bonus {{FoodIcon6}} Food yields; they can only be built on certain [Resources%20%28Civ6%29](Resources), however. These tile improvements are as follows:
Improvements are a major way to boost {{FoodIcon6}} Food production in all stages of the game, but the adjacency bonuses provided to the Farm by [Feudalism%20%28Civ6%29](Feudalism) and later [Replaceable%20Parts%20%28Civ6%29](Replaceable Parts) are also very important. They have the potential to boost your {{Citizen6}} Population growth immensely, both because of the boost to {{FoodIcon6}} Food yield (allowing a single Farm to provide a whopping +7 {{FoodIcon6}} Food if surrounded by six other Farms) and the increase of the {{Housing6}} limit in the city. You should study these mechanics well and make use of them whenever possible.
Religious Beliefs.
There are two religious [Pantheon%20%28Civ6%29](Pantheons) that grant bonus {{FoodIcon6}} Food from certain improvements. [Goddess%20of%20the%20Hunt%20%28Civ6%29](Goddess of the Hunt) grants +1 additional {{FoodIcon6}} Food yield from [Camp%20%28Civ6%29](Camps), and in [vanilla](vanilla) "Civilization VI" and "Rise and Fall", [Goddess%20of%20Festivals%20%28Civ6%29](Goddess of Festivals) grants +1 additional {{FoodIcon6}} Food yield from {{Wine6}}, {{Incense6}}, {{Cocoa6}}, {{Tobacco6}}, {{Coffee6}}, and {{Tea6}} [Plantation%20%28Civ6%29](Plantations).
Buildings.
Unlike other main stats, there is no {{District6}} directly dedicated to {{FoodIcon6}} Food, though the [City%20Center%20%28Civ6%29](City Center) has +2 {{FoodIcon6}} Food as a base yield, and the [Neighborhood%20%28Civ6%29](Neighborhood) has a major positive impact on {{Citizen6}} Population growth. However, several buildings from both the City Center and other districts increase {{FoodIcon6}} Food output. These include:
The Feed the World [Beliefs%20%28Civ6%29%23Follower](follower belief) also provides {{FoodIcon6}} Food from [Shrine%20%28Civ6%29](Shrines) and [Temple%20%28Civ6%29](Temples).
Trade Routes.
Domestic {{TradeRoute6}}s always grant additional {{FoodIcon6}} Food to their city of origin. The exact amount depends on the districts available at the destination:
The [Policy%20card%20%28Civ6%29](policy card) {{Link6|Collectivization}} grants +4 bonus {{FoodIcon6}} Food from all domestic {{TradeRoute6}}s.
Domestic {{TradeRoute6}}s can be extremely useful for jump-starting a city's population growth if the city isn't in a very fertile area. For these cities they may continue to be critical for city growth later, simply because the city has exhausted the fertile tiles that surround it.
Likewise, the policy card {{Link6|Arsenal of Democracy}} provides +2 {{FoodIcon6}} Food to both cities from {{TradeRoute6}}s to an ally's city. Apart from this, international {{TradeRoute6}}s very rarely grant {{FoodIcon6}} Food - they serve other purposes.
Wonders.
There are four [Wonder%20%28Civ6%29](wonders) that grant bonus {{FoodIcon6}} Food upon completion:
However, multiple [Natural%20wonder%20%28Civ6%29](natural wonders) grant {{FoodIcon6}} Food bonuses to the civilizations that own them:
Unique Bonuses.
There are only a few unique pieces of infrastructure and [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](civ/leader abilities) that grant special {{FoodIcon6}} Food bonuses:
