# Clear Wetlands (Civ3)

Clearing wetlands is a way [Worker%20%28Civ3%29](workers) can terraform in Civ 3. Resources that would not normally appear on the resulting tile are not removed by this action (i.e. it is possible to create a tile with [Fish%20%28Civ3%29](Fish) on [Grassland%20%28Civ3%29](Grassland)).
