# Helena Rubinstein (Civ6)

Helena Rubinstein is an {{Link6|Atomic Era}} [Great%20Merchant%20%28Civ6%29](Great Merchant) in "[Civilization%20VI](Civilization VI)".
Unique ability.
Grants 2 {{Cosmetics6}}, a uniquely manufactured Luxury resource which provides +4 {{Amenities6}}.
Strategy.
Similar to other Great Merchants that grant unique luxuries, Helena Rubenstein's ability can give [City%20%28Civ6%29](cities) a needed boost to their yields in the late game, as well as provide mass amounts of {{Gold6}} from trading with the [AI](AI) in [single%20player](single player). However, a bonus luxury resource, while nice, is not usually worth spending {{Gold6}} or {{Faith6}} on recruiting. The exceptions are when playing as [Scottish%20%28Civ6%29](Scotland), which can turn {{Amenities6}} into {{Production6}} and {{Gold6}}; and as [Montezuma%20%28Civ6%29](Montezuma), who can turn luxuries into {{Strength6}} Combat Strength. Rubenstein is a gamechanger for both Scotland and Montezuma, and should be a high priority for both of them.
