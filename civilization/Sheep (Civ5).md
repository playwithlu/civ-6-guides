Very often they appear in [Desert%20%28Civ5%29](Deserts), which makes them important for [Arabian%20%28Civ5%29](Arabia) and [Moroccan%20%28Civ5%29](Morocco) (both of which are desert-dwelling [Civilizations%20%28Civ5%29](civilizations)). They're a bit more difficult to develop than because they require a [Pasture%20%28Civ5%29](Pasture), but their yield is more diversified thanks to the bonus of the Hills they're found on. So, instead of providing a whole lot of like or , they provide a balanced quantity of both +3 and +3 upon researching [Fertilizer%20%28Civ5%29](Fertilizer).
A [Stable%20%28Civ5%29](Stable) can be built in the [City%20%28Civ5%29](city) working a Sheep resource; it will improve their yield further, adding 1 .
