# Lakes (Civ5)

Lakes are a type of [Terrain%20%28Civ5%29%23Base%20Terrain](base terrain) in "[Civilization%20V](Civilization V)".
Game Info.
Base terrain consisting of any group of 10 or fewer [Water%20%28Civ5%29](water) tiles completely surrounded by land.
Strategy.
Lakes are terrain features found anywhere on land. A Lake is every single water tile which is completely surrounded by land, or any collection of water tiles that aren't so numerous as to be considered an inland sea. The difference between a Lake and an inland sea is that the Lake has [Fresh%20water%20%28Civ5%29](fresh water), which it provides to the surrounding tiles (besides having a different base yield).
