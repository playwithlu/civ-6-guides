# Island1ExitBigMap14 (C-evo)

"MIFUDD_Island1ExitBigMap" is the name of one of the [predesigned%20maps%20%28C-evo%29](predesigned maps) created in 2009 by "mifudd", most of which have been heavily edited to give the human player a discernible advantage. Playing at Hard [difficulty%20level%20%28C-evo%29](difficulty level) should give a hard-fought win. Even insane level may be successful.
The icon displayed when you highlight the map in your map menu says "210% Size, 15 Players". You start on a small round continent that would be an island but for a strip of tiles joining it to a far larger continent, which stretches from Arctic to Antarctic. Your capital is a port. Mountains discourage invaders, and some mountains will reveal resources once you research [Science%20%28C-evo%29](Science). The author has marked good city sites with roads.
Most of the other 16 possible starting positions are close to you. Explore and make friends! You may find other city sites that are edited to advantage whoever has a city there.
If you edit the map so as to start somewhere else, good choices are the starting position to the north-west and the most isolated starting position in the north. Nations occupying the peninsula designed for you are likely to play distinctly less well than you would.
