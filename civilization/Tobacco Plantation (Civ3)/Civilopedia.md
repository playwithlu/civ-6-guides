# Tobacco Plantation (Civ3)/Civilopedia

Soon after the Europeans arrived in the New World, they learned that the native Americans were
smoking the Nicotiana plant, either in pipes or rolled in leaves. It didn't take long for this
new product, which had a pleasing aroma and relaxed the user, to make it back to Europe. Huge
plantations for the growth of tobacco sprung up in the New World, especially in Cuba, the
Carolinas, and Virginia.
