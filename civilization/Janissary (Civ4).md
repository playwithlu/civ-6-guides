# Janissary (Civ4)

The Janissary is the [Unique%20unit%20%28Civ4%29](unique unit) of the [Ottoman%20%28Civ4%29](Ottoman) [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ4](civilization).
Strategy.
Compared to the [Musketman%20%28Civ4%29](Musketman), which this unit replaces, the Janissary is 25% more effective against [Archery%20unit%20%28Civ4%29](Archers), [Melee%20unit%20%28Civ4%29](Melee units) and [List%20of%20mounted%20units%20in%20Civ4](Mounted units).
Using Janissaries.
Janissaries are extremely effective against any pre-[Renaissance%20Era%20%28Civ4%29](Renaissance) unit. For this reason, it's recommended to get [Gunpowder%20%28Civ4%29](Gunpowder) as soon as possible, before any opponents so you have the upper hand against anything they send at you.
The bonus against Mounted units ensures your lands are mostly safe from pillaging, and any fast response to your Janissaries will be compromised. The bonus against Melee units helps defend your [City%20%28Civ4%29](cities), and deepens the divide between [Maceman%20%28Civ4%29](Maceman) and Musketman strength. Finally, the bonus against Archery units makes the Janissaries highly effective attacking units.
Against Janissaries.
Despite the Janissaries' +25% against Mounted units, they are slightly less effective than [Pikeman%20%28Civ4%29](Pikemen) against mounted units. [Knight%20%28Civ4%29](Knights) may be ideal to attack them. Once you research Gunpowder, the Ottomans lose their advantage - promote Musketmen in [Pinch%20%28Civ4%29](Pinch) and you can stop their upper hand.
Additionally, as the Ottomans will probably rush towards Gunpowder, they'll have missed out some other key [List%20of%20technologies%20in%20Civ4](technologies) along the way and are likely to be picking them up - with a war-torn economy. There's a fair chance you can beat them to [Rifleman%20%28Civ4%29](Riflemen).
