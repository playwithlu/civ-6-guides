# Cristo Redentor (Civ4)

Strategy.
The Cristo Redentor permanently eliminates all [Anarchy%20%28Civ4%29](anarchy) in your [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ4](civilization) and requires no waiting period when switching between [Religion%20%28Civ4%29](Religions) or [List%20of%20civics%20in%20Civ4](Civics). It also increases the chances of a [Great%20Engineer%20%28Civ4%29](Great Engineer) appearing.
