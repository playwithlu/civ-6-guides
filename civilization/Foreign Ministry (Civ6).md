The Foreign Ministry is a Tier 2 [Government%20%28Civ6%29](government) [Buildings%20%28Civ6%29](building) in "". It is built in the [Government%20Plaza%20%28Civ6%29](Government Plaza) [District%20%28Civ6%29](district) and requires a Tier 2 government ([Merchant%20Republic%20%28Civ6%29](Merchant Republic), [Monarchy%20%28Civ6%29](Monarchy), or [Theocracy%20%28Civ6%29](Theocracy)) and a Tier 1 government building ([Ancestral%20Hall%20%28Civ6%29](Ancestral Hall), [Audience%20Chamber%20%28Civ6%29](Audience Chamber), or [Warlord%27s%20Throne%20%28Civ6%29](Warlord's Throne)).
Strategy.
Of all the Tier 2 government buildings, the Foreign Ministry has the most limited scope of use. The problem with [City-state%20%28Civ6%29](city-states') armies is that they are very likely to be obsolete, and a mere +4 {{Strength6}} Combat Strength doesn't help bridge the power gap. If you want to levy them, you must pay {{Gold6}} to levy and then extra {{Gold6}} and [Resource%20%28Civ6%29](resources) to upgrade them. This only works for defensive [Civilizations%20%28Civ6%29](civilizations) that tend to amass a huge treasury and resource reservoir without a large standing army, and need to mobilize a large army in a short period of time when they are attacked. Other than that, the only two civilizations that should build this building instead of the [Grand%20Master%27s%20Chapel%20%28Civ6%29](Grand Master's Chapel) or [Intelligence%20Agency%20%28Civ6%29](Intelligence Agency) are [Sumerian%20%28Civ6%29](Sumeria) (who can already levy city-states at a discount) if they have a lot of resources, and most importantly, [Hungarian%20%28Civ6%29](Hungary). Hungary has excellent synergy with this building, as they have no problem with upgrading [Unit%20%28Civ6%29](units) once they collect the {{Gold6}} to levy them. The extra {{Strength6}} Combat Strength on top of the bonus from [Matthias%20Corvinus%20%28Civ6%29](Matthias Corvinus) is also greatly appreciated.
In "", the +3 {{DiplomaticFavor6}} arguably becomes the best benefit of the Foreign Ministry, especially for those attempting a [Victory%20%28Civ6%29%23Diplomacy](Diplomatic Victory). The equivalent of three [Suzerain%20%28Civ6%29](Suzerainties') worth of {{DiplomaticFavor6}} can be potent if this building is built early on, though doing so means forgoing the Intelligence Agency and its bonuses to [Spy%20%28Civ6%29](Spies) (which a diplomatic player wants for [Espionage%20%28Civ6%29%23Mission%20Details](Fabricate Scandal missions)).
