# Tile (Civ4)

Square tiles are the basic quantum of location in "[Civilization%20IV](Civilization IV)". All [List%20of%20units%20in%20Civ4](units) and [City%20%28Civ4%29](cities) are located in a particular tile. You can see tile boundaries clearly if you turn on the "Show Grid Lines" feature.
Tiles have [Terrain%20%28Civ4%29](terrain), and may have any number of units present. They may also have a city. Tiles have [Culture%20%28Civ4%29](culture) infusing them, and will be owned by no more than one [List%20of%20civilizations%20in%20Civ4](civilization): the one with the most culture present.
