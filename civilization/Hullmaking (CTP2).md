Great Library entry.
Although skin boats, like the coracle, were widely used in the calm and shallow waters around the world, they had little impact on the development of wooden-hulled ships. The dugout boat, a long, slender boat carved out of the trunk of a massive tree was developed from 300 BC on. The Viking longship was one of the first seafaring vessels that employed a clinker-built hull with overlapping planks of wood. A single square sail and oarsmen propelled it, and it performed exceptionally in heavy seas. Ranging from 45 to 75 feet in length, it was a main component of Viking pirate raids in the 9th century and even brought Leif Eriksson to America in 1000 AD. Although the Dutch, French, English and Germans also employed the longship in war and in trade, only the Vikings managed to venture across the Atlantic Ocean.
