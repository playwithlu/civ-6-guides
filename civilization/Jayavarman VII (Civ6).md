Intro.
 Wise Jayavarman, seventh to hold the name, the Khmer admire your dedication to their well-being. Your command of the land's fresh waters lets you feed your hungry people, just as it brings you ever closer to Heaven. Go forth, divine architect! Build an empire that approaches perfection—and may your enemies find their end beneath your mighty war elephants.
In-Game.
Jayavarman VII's unique [Agenda%20%28Civ6%29](agenda) is An End to Suffering. He likes civilizations that have [Holy%20Site%20%28Civ6%29](Holy Sites) and a high average [City%20%28Civ6%29](city) Population, and dislikes civs that are lacking in either of these areas.
His [Unique%20ability%20%28Civ6%29](leader ability) is Monasteries of the King. His Holy Sites earn a major adjacency bonus from Rivers, gain if built on a River, grant equal to their adjacency bonuses, and trigger [Culture%20Bomb%20%28Civ6%29](Culture Bombs).
Detailed Approach.
Jayavarman wants to take advantage of his river [Starting%20bias%20%28Civ6%29](start bias) and place his Holy Sites along rivers where they will claim nearby land and provide and . These cities will then bloom when the Khmer reach the late [Classical%20Era%20%28Civ6%29](Classical era) when both [Aqueduct%20%28Civ6%29](Aqueducts) and their unique [Prasat%20%28Civ6%29](Prasat) temples come online. If neighbors crowd them in, they can use their [Domrey%20%28Civ6%29](Domrey) [Unique%20unit%20%28Civ6%29](unique unit) to besiege a few nearby cities, probably grabbing additional sites along rivers. With a populous empire based around [Buddhism%20%28Civ6%29](the Buddhist faith), Jayavarman can pursue any [Victory%20%28Civ6%29](victory) type moving forward into the later game.
Lines.
Jayavarman VII is voiced by [Heng%20Sarorn](Heng Sarorn). He speaks royal and refers to the player as "Preah Ang," which can be translated as "God-King." The Khmer only used their title to refer to their kings, and Jayavarman's use of it even when declaring war and defeated means he thinks of the player as his equal.
